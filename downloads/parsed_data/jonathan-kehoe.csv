So Alice Cooper was GREAT. This guy is 58 years old and still comes off as fresh. He's been around the world and back again thousands of times. The other week he pops into my little town for the first time in about 20 years. Just to say hello and rock the shit out of us, I guess. The songs were great, even the ones I wasn't familiar with and they were instantly sing-a-long-able at that. DIRRRRTY DIIIIMONDS!! The theatrics were excellent as well, Alice got beheaded by a guilitine and everything. Colin and Amanda came in from Stephenville to see the show; spending the weekend and then seeing it with them was so much fun. I wish we all could have sat together (we each bought tickets at different times) but Colin's reaction was still worth it. He even had the line of the night:

""I've been wishing for him to come to town for years and years and when I finally gave up all hope he's here. That's ok though... Alice doesn't want me to have hope.""

Come back soon, guys.

Another positive thing about the Cooper concert is that my interest in heavy metal has peaked again. Been listening to some old and new tunes. Colin gave a cd chock-full of neat Alice stuff and let us rip some bands like Sentenced and Lacuna Coil. I've been spinning some old Metallica stuff and Corrosion of Conformity too. New Tool album is pretty sweet too, by the way. AND Wanda and I have been playing Guitar Hero a fair bit as well. I'm working on Expert level, some of those tunes are a beeyotch. It's a love/hate thing, really.

Comics, comics. Bought Marvel 1602 the other day. It's written by Neil Gaiman of Sandman fame. I remember when this thing came out last year, there was a LOT of hype by Marvel as the summer event of the year. I didn't buy it at the time because of that. Reviews were mixed, people wanted the Marvel version of Sandman I guess. But here we are one year later and I love the thing. Long story short, the original Marvel characters have come into existence in England in the year 1602. Something has happened on a huge scale that has required that the Age of Marvel come early than it did in the 1960's. It's quite an interesting read. Trying to figure out who is who is interesting as well. The names are changed a little, and characters revealed over time. It's best written Dr. Strange and Nick Fury characterization I've seen in read some time. Perhaps a full review is necessary, I wouldn't mind getting back into the blogging swing of things.

Anyways, I'm gone... gonna watch Metallica's Some Kind Of Monster Movie.

Kehoe out."

"event","Where oh where has my little Kehoe gone? What has he been doing for so long that he hasn't posted on his journal in months???

I'll tell you where. I've been either:

a) Playing my DS

or

b) Watching Wrestlemania DVD's

No joke. Just ask Wanda, she'll probably give you an earful on the subject.

But really, my DS has taken over my life. I'm playing about 7 different games at different points in each one. Mario 64, Animal Crossing, Trauma Center, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, Resident Evil DS, Nintendogs and Kirby Canvas Curse. Oh and yesterday I bought Metroid Prime Hunters. So that makes EIGHT. Sigh, it's too bad that these are all GREAT GAMES. Hopefully you'll see a review of some of these, at least the ones that I haven't already been raving about. 

That being said, let's turn our attention to item #b, the Wrestlemania DVDs. 

You may have noticed on the main site, kehoe.8m.com that I posted a review of Wrestlemanias 1 and 2. I didn't really let the cat out of the bag at that point, but here's is the feline it's all it's glory: Wanda encouraged me to buy the Wrestlemania Box Set.

Yes, you read that correctly. WANDA ENCOURAGED ME to buy TWENTY-ONE Wrestlemanias at once. Yes, it was on sale and yes she also had a coupon but hey, it was her idea. 

It's a fact that I hold aloft like Excaliber, drawn from the stone which makes me king, king of all that is Wrestlemania. 

No matter how much it annoys her. And annoy her it does, to no end I imagine. For you see, Wrestlemania 22 is this Sunday. So what is a wrestling fanboy with time on his hands and a 21-disc box set to do? Why watch each and every last one of them AND review each of them in time for this Sunday of course.

Yes, I know I started back in January, but at that point I was watching each one at least twice so that I could write a comprehensive review. That got old around Mania 4 sometime in February. But this month, I've been fitting in one or two Manias a week, including 18 and 19 just this past weekend. Even I'm almost to the point of overload. 

But Wanda, she is drove completely nuts.

And I love her for encouraging me.

Kehoe out."

"event","Watching the new Bret Hart dvd... three disc set, 90 minute documentary, oodles of matches and tributes... can't go wrong people. It's at least as good as the Ultimate Ric Flair Collection, which is definitely in the Top 3 wrestling DVD's that I own. Right now, I'm on Disc three watching Bret Hart vs Diesel from Survivor Series 1995. During the last few months before Nash left for WCW to form the NWO. It was probably the best time of Nash's career, getting memorable matches out of not just Bret but also the Undertaker at Mania 12 and then against HBK in their classic No Holds Barred match. Too bad Nash sucked the big one ever since.

What else, what else.. oh, so Animal Crossing has once again taken over my life. But this time it's the DS version. It's so bad that on New Year's Eve we counted dowsn not only the real New Year's but also on the DS machines (mine and Julie's). Sad, but entertaining.

As far as the game goes, it's pretty much a major update of the original Cube version. There's LOTS more things to do and places/people to visit. I miss the NES games, but they make up for it with extra stuff. The online component is really cool, though I'd like to do more visiting of oeople's towns than I have. See what others are doing. There's no random search feature unfortunately, but getting a friend code off the net isn't hard.

Ok, back to real life... tomorrow is Rhonda's last day. Training time is over, I'm on my own for a year.

Sigh.... I'll be fine.

There's a fair but of work to be done, but there's a year to do it. No problem. ;)

"event","Anyone recall sometime last year when I blasted the game Prince of Persia: Warrior Within? It was the terrible sequel to PoP: The Sands of Time; a funny, fresh and addictive game that I still highly recommend. In WW, UbiSoft improved the fighting system and lengthened the game but piled on the angst, grit and metal thongs. By upping the 14 year old appeal factor they almost completely ruined the franchise for me. That is until now with the release of the second sequel, PoP: The Two Thrones. 

I rented this sucker last night and have played it a fair bit. I'm nowhere near finishing it but the improvement in feel and fun became apparant right from the get-go. Lots of cool platforming puzzles, and even more enhancements to the fighting system. There's more emphasis on stealth and you have new light and dark abilities with different fighting movesets for each form. The dialogue is no longer corny and contrived, but full of mystery again. I've given the hint to Wanda that this could be a great Christmas gift, so a full review will come in the new year.

More on games... I bit the bullet and got a new router (after breaking the old one) so I could play MarioKart DS online properly, without having to go to Julie's or Don Cherry's restaurant to do so. At this moment my record is not so hot, 9 wins and 16 losses. The online experience is very fun, but still has some limitations and bugs to work out. If anyone out there is playing on the Nintendo WiFi network and would like to play some Kart online, my friend code is: 511160967474. My aunt Evelyn is getting us Animal Crossing DS for Christmas, so I'll be taking visitors from the online commmunity around then.

So I had a long chat with my old buddy Larry Dwyer last night. He's one of the guys that I grew up with, one of my brothers. It's a funny thing with my friends from Flatrock... we can have next to no communication for months and months, one phone call and it's like they never left. Same goes for Seano and Colin. I miss my buddies, I really do. 

Kehoe out."

"event","First off, I guess you probably all know by now, Eddie Geurrero passed away a week ago. He died of heart failure. It was caused by a life of hard drinking and drugs on top of a hard day to day life of wrestling related injuries, travel, contantly working out, etc, etc. He'd been clean and sober for the last four years which is a great credit to him but according to the autopsy reports the damage had been done. He had an enlarged heart that just gave out last Sunday night in his hotel room. A sad loss for the wrestling industry but even sadder for his family and freinds. All accounts say that Eddie was a tremendously funny guy, a great friend and a dedicated father and husband. I hope this is a wake up call for Vince and Co. to realize that they have to allow their wrestlers time to heal and to rest. 

It was a major shock to me, I've been an Eddie fan since his early days in WCW. Back when I'd watch him on TBS WCW Saturday Night at Nan's house in Dunville back when we didn't get TBS in town. I really got into Eddie when he bacame the WCW Crusierweight champion and was feuding with guys like Rey Mysterio and Chris Jericho. Eddie was always entertaining and always innovative in his matches, even then. When he came to WWF/E with Benoit, Malenko and Saturn I was overjoyed. After that Eddie came up with the hilarious Latino Heat era with Chyna and won the IC title in the process. Eddie went to Smackdown after the draft and formed the tag championship winning team of Los Geurreros with Chavo. Once Los Geurreros broke up, Eddie went solo again, this time as a main event player and then winning the WWE title against Brock Lesnar at No Way Out 2004 (We even bought a cake to celebrate). One month later he co-main evented Wrestlemania 20 in a classic match with Kurt Angle, retaining the title by lying, stealing and cheating. It was an incredible career and so sad that it won't continue. Eddie Geurrero was a shining jewel in this business, a performer and talent that will will be impossible to forget. 

Sigh....

Now, the ups.

We got a second DS for Wanda last week, a teal green one at that. I mean, if you're going to play Meteos and MarioKart DS, you might as well play head to head right? 

A MarioKart DS review is on the way, and let me assure you that a glowing review is forthcoming. Best. Kart. Ever.

The new job is going well, I'm learning quie a bit about how the refinery actually works and what decisions get made to achieve new specs, and deal with various problems and scenarios. I miss the hands on work at the lab, but I'm getting to see a bigger picture at work, which is quite interesting.

The b-movie marathon was fun. Though the movies we saw turned out to be pretty decent. Mystery Science theatre 3000 is always a classic, Escape from New york was fun, Conan The Destroyer was nice and campy PG-13 violence. Day of the Triffids was classic sci-fi. 

Transylvania 6-500 came in the mail on Monday, and I am JONESIN' to watch it.

Anyway, we're watching The Adeventures of Baron Munchausen... a great and underrated fantasy film. More to come!

The really big news is that I got a new job! It's still at the refinery, it's a position as Quality Control Officer. It's a maternity position, so it's only for a year. But it's a great opportunity to get management experience and make some extra dough as well. In a nutshell, it's my job to ensure everything we produce at the refinery is what we say it is. Make sure equipment is running properly, if there are any problems or complaints to investigate the cause of the problem and eliminate the potential for further errors. I'll be implementing a new level of QC control, what's called ISO 900 certification. That's a high standard for the lab to show that we are at a high level of skill, accuracy and precision that is equivalent with any lab in the country. Well, any lab at that level that is. It's a lot more responsibility and takes me out of the Union, but I think I'm young enough to take a risk and build myself toward a larger career than just as a pure technician. If I don't like it, it's only for a year so I have the option to get out. This also means I'm off shift for over a year. Eight hour days, 7:30 - 4:00 five days a week. I've already had one work day, and it felt FAST. So no more nights or weekends. It also means no more overtime or First Aid training days but I'll still make much more than I did this year with all those extras. And I get home at a decent hour (5:30-6 instead of 7:30-8) and have every weekend off. That's great for stuff during Christmas and especially the summer. I missed so much this past year while jumping from shift to shift. I still don't have any vacation and stuff but I'll have my evenings and again, weekends off. 

I'll miss the hands on analysis though, and the lab people I interact with each day. I'll see and talk with them but I doubt it will be 100% the same. I think I've made friends with everyone there, I enjoy pretty much everyone's company and I hope vice versa. I know that some of them are very pro-Union and my leaving may affect that now that I'm management, maybe. I hope not.

But it's a big step for me and one that I'm excited about. 

In less important news, I picked up yet another DS game. It's a puzzle game called Meteos. It's a falling block game, but it's not a Tetris clone. There's a sort of story to it where you arrange falling blocks in colored groups of three or more which sends them shooting off into space toward an enemy planet. If you can't clear the screen of blocks then your planet is destroyed. It's really well done and VERY addicting. I'll post a full review later.

So I missed Halloween as expected, and yet I survived. No costumes and such but hey, there's next year. 

Let's see... oh, we have B-movie marathon planned with Aaron and Stacy next week. Should be fun. We've got a decent list of movies to pick from. We're going for a so bad it's good kind of thing. Here's a list we have compiled so far. We won't be getting all of them, but we're going to narrow it down from these plus any suggestions you fine people may have:

Transylvania 6-5000
American Ninja
Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter
Escape from New York
The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra
Dead Alive
Tremors
Super Mario Brothers: The Movie
Street Fighter
Conan The Destroyer
Attack of the Killer Tomatoes
Last Action Hero
Monster Squad
Van Helsing
Plan 9 From Outer Space

So let's hear some suggestions from you guys... I KNOW I'm missing some goodies.... err.. baddies.

"event","Shift #2 of my set of five nights is more than half over, one more shift and I'm over the hump. I got my day shifts switched with Cliff's nights. He's got some Union stuff on the go this weekend (a trip to Halifax I think) so I can see not wanting to try and come off nights. We had a tasty (ie. salty) moose stew for supper. This shift puts salt meat in EVERYTHING. Tomorrow is a lighter meal of lasagna, Cesar salad and garlic bread. We're celebrating Dan's new job outside in the units. Interestingly for me, this opens up a potential full time permanent job on shift. Rhonda (the plant QA/QC manager) is also going on maternity leave in December, leaving another hole if only for a year. Could be an interesting few weeks/months.

I'm starting to enjoy nights alot these past summer and fall. Well, there's pros and cons I suppose. I like the more relaxed atmosphere on nights. Not that it's always slow on nights, far from it. But there are less people around, which gives me the chance to do things like update my blog without prying eyes over my shoulder. The bigwigs and supervisors are at home, so you tend to be more relaxed around your co-workers. Less worried about people watching you I suppose. Days has it's perks too though. I like the feeling of being in the middle of decision making process. Instruments get troubleshot on days, there's the safety meetings and consulting with Rhonda or Sean on what's going on in the lab and how it can be improved. With regards to those things on nights, it feels like you're getting second hand news and orders. 

Then again, I wouldn't be able to eat prime rib dinners or play Super Mario World without nights and weekends now would I?

So this Saturday, North Atlantic Refining will be named one of the top 10 employers in Canada by the Financial Post. Macleans magazine also has it in the top 100. I think that's pretty cool. It kinda puts a different spin on what you think about your place of employment when you get that kind of hugely positive feedback from the outside. I hear a fair bit of grumbling and complaints from workers around site (hell, I've even made a few myself) but maybe I shouldn't take so much of that to heart and compare what we have to what the rest of the country is working with. I've always thought of this place as so much smaller than the rest of Canada, to the point of maybe being under the industry radar... but maybe I shouldn't have. I've had alot of thoughts about where we're going to end up down the road, where we would build careers and our home and alot of those thoughts didn't include North Atlantic to be quite honest. It was a bit of a wake up call when I heard the news.

On a lighter note, I bought the new Bruce Dickinson album, Tyranny of Souls. I like it and I haven't taken it out of the car since I put it in. However, if I may use a quote from Colin from our phone conversation a few weeks ago, ""It's a good album. But Jonny, it's no Chemical Wedding"". After several listens, that's pretty much my thought on the album too.

Nintendogs update: We got a second dog, a female Miniature Dachund named Teddy for Wanda. She's about four times smaller than Nobel though she doesn't let that bother her too much. She fights for that frisbee just as hard. She can't run as fast, but that doesn't stop her from taking it from him when she catches up. Wanda trained her, so Teddy only responds to her voice commands and won't listen to me at all. Lately Nobel hasn't been listening so much either, maybe it's because I haven't been using voice commands so often the last few days while I'm at work and in the car pool. However, he's doing great in the frisbee competitions. We got enough money for a new apartment (a condo actually) and for Teddy. Once we build up some more, Wanda said she wants a husky. I did a little window shoping and it looks like huskys are a little ill-tempered and require a lot of attention. We'll have to debate that one further. Oh, I found a pirates hat for Nobel and a tiara for Teddy while on a walk. Wanda's gonna melt when she sees them. Awfully cute people, awfully cute.

Saw Wallace and Grommit with the M... Collins' on Wednesday night. Great flick for anyone you ng or old. One of the funniest I've seen this year.

On the wrestling front there's been an sudden infestation of McMahons on RAW. It's coincided with the return of RAW to the USA network in the States as Austin decided to give the Stunner to the entire McMahon family in one segment, including Linda McMahon. It was entertaining but I had no idea it would result in the full time return of the McMahons to television, including the heel turn of Linda as she kicked J.R. in the balls when she fired him. It was bad enough that HHH came back to kick the snot out of Ric Flair, now we have the double whammy. Thank God Angle is on the show or else it might be unwatchable. Smackdown is not faring much better. The Batista/Eddie ""feud"" is doing nothing for me, I didn't even care missing the ppv last Sunday. Something drastic has to be done to pump up that show and soon. Maybe it's time to bring Brock back in finally. 

Good night, everybody.

"event","Since we got the DS I've been doing some research on the various games that are out on the systen, looking for originality and innovation but also a fun game. As I've mentioned, Animal Crossing DS and MarioKart DS are locks for our DS library but they won't be so much ""original"" as they will be extensions on a successful format. Like most PSP games, evidently. There are some interesting things out on DS now like Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrows and Advance Wars: Dual Strike that will probably get picked up down the road but I also wanted something that Wanda would get into as well.

Enter Trauma Center - Under The Knife. Think anime General Hospital meets an updated version of that classic board game Operation. It is 2016 and you are Dr. Styles, a young doctor trying to make a name for yourself as a credible, successful surgeon. You want to impress the hospital management as well as the young nurse assigned to you by performing your operations quickly yet skillfully. The story is pretty light in Trauma Center and it is quite linear. However, it's well written and enjoyable but it really has no bearing on the real meat of the game; the actual operations (which you can repeat in challenge mode at your leisure). More on the operations in a moment. The story and dialogue is text based with a still photo of the anime style character expressing the emotion of the moment. Each chapter/section is divided into storyline, patient briefing and operation. You must complete the operation to move on to the next chapter. Basic, but it works. The graphics of the surgeries are sort of cartoonish, kind of like an 3-d rendered animated text book. There's blood and guts, but what would a surgery be like without those? The situations might make someone squeemish but there's nothing gross here. 

Now onto the actual surgery. You have ten tools at your disposal: a surgical laser, forceps, antibiotic gel, your own hands, syringe for dispensing drugs, a needle for stitches, bandages, ultrasound/magnifier, suction and the all important scalpel. Each case is different, for example the first case involves a motorcyclist who had an accident and there are shards of glass embedded in his arm. You have to clean up the small cuts, extract the protruding glass and dress the wounds. Then you have to go inside the arm and recover deeper shards of glass. A more complicated case (and the hardest for me so far) has you using using an anti-inflammatory to reduce the size of several aneurysms in the side of a patients intestine. You must magnify the aneurysm, decrease them to a managable size, cut them away, drain the excess blood, manually reattach the veins and stitch them up. The problem escalates as more and more suddenly aneurysms appear all over, resulting in you rushing to control them without them all bursting and thus losing your patient. This was the last operation I performed, and I'm not even halfway through... things should get even harder.

Of course, all within the five minute time limit. There are other ways to lose as well. Obviously, if the patient dies then it's over too but you also get a ""cool"", ""good"", ""bad"" or ""miss"" rating for each move you perform. If you exceed the miss limit the operation is over. So many things working against you. Thank goodness the gameplay is super-smooth and the controls are very easy to learn. You use the stylus for everything, the buttons are completely unnecessary. You use it to select menus, use it to cut with a scalpel, you even use it to externally massage a patient's heart. When the Atlus company got the contract from Nintendo to make a DS game they must have thought, ""How can we use this touch screen thing in the craziest way?"" It must have been a blast developing the game.

Let me tell you, some of these operations can get pretty stressful as the ER-style music plays in the background and as your nurse berates you if you make mistakes or when she panics if things start going badly. Wanda really gets stressed out when she's playing, you can watch her breathing quicken as an operation goes on and when she jumps when something suddenly bad happens. It's quite the treat to see her so into a new game. She is somewhat of a non-gamer (or a gamer with specific tastes maybe) and I think it says something about the universal appeal of a game like this. Anyone could relate to the subject matter and the controls are just so intuitive and responsive. I really hope Atlus has a contract to make a Trauma Center game for the new Nintendo ""Revolution"" system coming out next year. Judging by the freehand mouse/laser pointer style of the new controller, a more in depth and complex version of this gamestyle would be a fantastic addition to the Revolution launch lineup. Give it a deeper, branching storymode with more scenarios, voice actors and of course, more surgical tools! Drills, saws, chest separators and difibrilators please! It would be a HUGE hit.

However, don't get me wrong here. This game stands on it's own. It is a fun, addictive and ORIGINAL portable game and a must-buy for any Nintendo DS owner.

I'm still on shift this week, which is a very good thing. The autumn pinch can hurt sometimes. It's a week to week basis while Greg fills in at the office. It's a good carpool, I only have to drive all the way to the refinery once every four shifts. Otherwise it's just to Holyrood or Whitbourne. Not too bad at all.

But the big story is that I bought a Nintendo DS this past weekend. My second handheld system, my first since the original Gameboy back in the day, when I won two from Browning Harvey on one of those coupon mail-in contests on the side of the pop cooler. I sent in two entries, I won two Gameboys. It was sweet. I should have kept both for head to head play but I sold one to Kenny Hogan down the street for a cool $77.77. That's what we negotiated, true story. 

But yeah, the DS.

I got it from Nintendo World on O'Leary Avenue, those guys have the best deal in the city: A DS and a game for $170. Everywhere else it's that price without the game. You get a choice of three: ""Super Mario DS"", ""Yoshi Touch and Go"" and some Pokemon game that I didn't care about. I went with the Mario freebie seeing as how it's pretty much Mario 64 which is one of the most well reviewed games on the old N64 system (an era I completely missed). Yoshi has also gotten some great reviews but seeing as it's a puzzle game, I wanted something with some more depth. That's because we bought a second game, Nintendogs. 

There's a cute story behind Nintendogs. It's basically a virtual pet game, not entirely unlike those Tamagachi things that were/are popular. Except this thing is pretty realistic. It's like a real dog. And cute, oh God is it cute. The story is that I've been teasing the idea of getting a DS for quite a while now, ever since the rumblings of wireless online DS versions of Animal Crossing and MarioKart began circulating on my favorite internet videogame websites. Wanda has been absolutely SICK of me bringing it up day after day, week after week to her and our friends. She's been pretty much against the idea but not entirely. That's because of Nintendogs. My pitch to get my grubby hands on a DS has been centered around how great and cute it would be to have our own puppy to take care of. The defence had weakened a bit through the use of pamphlets and nagging but the deciding blow came on Saturday when Julie announced that she had gotten a DS for her anniversary AND she had her own Nintendog AND it could already do three tricks.. 

The last straw was broken. 

The walls came tumbling down.

In a fit of jealous impulse buying, we got the DS on Sunday.

I like it a lot, using the stylus with the touch screen is very intuitive. At first I started tapping the upper, non-touch screen at times but I'm settled in with the machine quite nicely. It's a great way to pass time in the carpool I might add. I avoid giving my golden retriever, Nobel, voice commands when I'm driving with the boys though. Me telling a virtual dog to roll over probably wouldn't go over very well at five in the morning.

Whoops, gotta run. More to come!

"event","I finally finished Pikmin Friday night after much procrastination with the game. It really is a unique and excellent game, I just have had a dozen other games to play all at the same time.

Like Animal Crossing, this game is hard to describe. It's strategy-adventure and really cute. Consequently, Wanda loves the thing and its sequel. The story goes like this. You are Captain Olimar whose space shuttle has crash landed on a strange planet (which coincidentally looks like Earth). You could repair your ship, but thirty essential parts have broken off upon entry into the atmosphere and are scattered across the land. There are monsters everywhere but you have discovered a strange species of tiny creatures called Pikmin to help you. They are half plant, half animal and they will follow your every command. They will fight monsters, collect items, build bridges, destroy barriers... you name it. There are three kinds of Pikmin, red (immune to fire and the best fighters), blue (immune to water) and yellow (they carry bombs and are lighter for throwing to high places). So depending on the situation, enemies or terrain you choose your Pikmin army accordingly since you can have a maximum of one hundred Pikmin on the field at a time. Pikmin die and can be sprouted, they are sadly expendable. But incredibly useful.

Therein lies the strategy. You make your army and go out into the field to figure out the puzzle of how to collect your ship's parts and bring them back to your base before the time runs out. Yes, there is a time limit. You must collect your parts within thirty days (during daylight hours only, the really dangerous beasts come out at night) or else Olimar's breathing supply will run out. A day lasts about 15 minutes of our time, so hopefully you can collect at least one part per day. In some areas it's easy to gather two or even three, but some enemies can take almost all day to defeat. Again, strategy applies.

The adventure comes in the actual fighting. Each enemy is different and must be apporached as such. Some are better to attack from behind, some better to swarm with your army to pin it down, some enemies better to sacrifice a bomb carrying yellow Pikmin by letting the enemy swallow it. 

The game offers a very unique gaming experience, I really enjoyed it. The only downside is that the game could potetially be very, very short if you can figure out the puzzles and enemies quickly since each day is only 15 minutes long. Thirty days at fifteen minutes each is only seven and a half hours. However, you will most likely have to reset the game quite a bit when you realize your time is running short and start a level over and over. This will probably only give you around ten hours or so of gaming time. The sequel, Pikmin 2, improves on this greatly as well as adds more kinds of Pikmin to the mix. 

Once the game is over, there is the Challenge Mode in which you pick a level in which to try and build the biggest Pikmin Army you can in a day. You can compete with other people to beat their record over and over. So the game doesn't just end after thirty days. Again, Pikmin 2 improves this by allowing head to head competitions.

If you want to play something really different and a lot of innocent fun, try Pikmin or Pikmin 2.  These are probably Wanda's very favorite games on the Gamecube, and I have to rank it pretty high as well.

Pikmin gets 9/10 WHAM!'s."

"event","After three years, I have finally caught the flu.

<""cough"">

Perhaps it's the wearing a little hoodie as a jacket for the last month that did it.

Maybe it was going out and getting loaded at the Shore Tour in the rain in a little jacket that did it.

Or it could be that bottle marked ""flu"" that I drank from the other day.

No wait, nevermind. 

But yeah, I've been pretty lucky to have not been sick in a quite a while, seeing as I don't get any sick days at work. And I guess I'm also lucky that I have at least three days off before next week to get better.

But yeah, I haven't missed having the flu, that's for sure.

Anyway, the point.

I went to Walmart earlier to get some cough medicine and Draino for the bathroom... well I did a little more browsing and saw some interesting things.

Now, I don't want to plug Walmart, butu there are some deals you don't want to miss. (Kenmount Road location)

1) Wrestling DVDs. 
They're selling some TOP quality DVDs for dirt cheap. Shawn Michaels From the Vault, The Eddie Geurrero story and Mick Foley's Greatest Hits and misses for nine bucks each. NINE BUCKS!!?!?!??!?!?!? That's insane for two disc dvd sets like these. They're also selling the exquisite Ric Flair TRIPLE DVD Collection for less than TWENTY BUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's a $40+ value alone. I picked up the 2004 Hall of Fame Induction ceremony, a 30 dollar DV for 15 bucks. I got it for the extras, three hours of classic matches from the 70's and 80's. I'll post a review later.

2) Gameboy Micro
If you didn't know, Nintendo is selling a new, smaller version of the Gameboy Advance SP. It's only four inches wide and two inches tall. It's the size of my cell phone, and that's pretty friggin small. The screen is really small (2 inches) but with a brighter screen and 30% better resolution than the SP. It is TINY but but the price was set at 30 bucks more than the regular SP. So for some reason Walmart is selling it for just a hundred bucks. I guess someone else is selling it for that price, but I saw it there today. 

3) Halloween costumes
Sigh... I love Halloween. They had a roll of fake barbed wire there. If only I had time to grow a beard for a Cactus Jack costume.

"event","I was going to write about the AMAZING Pearl Jam show we saw on Saturday, but maybe later. What I do want to talk about is this new DVD that I picked up yesterday. 

So picture if you will, a young Jonathan Kehoe, about 13 years old. I was the biggest Ultimate Warrior mark ever. It's a dirty secret, these days if a guy like the Warrior popped up I'd be shitting all over him. But hey, I was young and the Warrior truly did have an intensity and presence that captured alot of fans and I was no exception.

First off, let me point out the obvious. This DVD is NOT complimentary. Well, there are some instances where they give him credit for his physique and fanfare, but about 99% of the time everyone from Bobby Heenan to Sgt. Slaughter to Ted Dibiase to Vince McMahon himself talk about how his low level of wrestling ability matched his massive ego and lack of respect for the wrestling business. Hulk Hogan talks about him bitter-sweetly, as a fun guy but who burned too many bridges to make money. They cover everything from his early career before the WWF and through debut through his IC and WWF Title runs. Then, they recall why the warrior left and returned several times (ego problems) and then on to his dismal WCW stint. It's a pretty comprehensive look, though a cynical one. 

A lot of the Warrior's success is attributed to the WWF/E marketing machine. An exciting ring entrance, a great look and profitable merchandising campaign. If the Warrior had a good match, it was because he had a great opponent. His feuds with Macho Man Randy Savage, Ravishing Rick Rude and Hulk Hogan were so good because of the hard work of the people he faced. Granted, he did learn a lot from these people and he did improve but when he faced less skilled guys like Papa Shango or The Beserker, he was dead in the water. Warrior sort of had the Goldberg push going for him, he was full of fire and intensity but his matches had to be short and sweet to cover his weaknesses.

Thankfully, the DVD includes what are probably the Warrior's best and most memorable matches. Interestingly, that adds up to only five. 

1) Ultimate Warrior's WWE debut on Wrestling Challenge in 1987.
Meh, it's a debut. Slow and kinda boring. But good enough to include for historical purposes.

2) Ultimate Warrior vs Honky Tonk Man at SummerSlam 88 - Intercontinental Title Match
This is the match that solidified me as a Warrior mark. Brutus Beefacke was billed to face Honky but he was sidelined after Ron Bass cut him up with boot spurs on the Saturday tv show Superstars just the week before the show. Warrior was the surprise opponent and ended Honky's LONG title run in about 34 seconds. Nothing worth mentioning wrestling wise but the crowd went BANANAS and the match put Warrior on the map.

3) Ultimate Warrior vs Hulk Hogan at Wrestlemania 6 - IC Title vs WWF Title
This is the match that solidified Warrior as a main event player. Classic brawl and the first time two major babyfaces faced off in a high profile event. It's the very high point in Warrior's career. He only got better wrestling-wise after this, but he was never as popular as he was the months after this match. Strangely, the WWE has edited out the Jesse Ventura side of the commentary and jacked up the crowd noise so here only Gorilla Monsoon can be heard marking out over the match. I watched the full version on the Mania 18 DVD, and it's so much better with Jesse's comments. Oh well. 

4) Ultimate Warrior vs Ravishing Rick Rude at SummerSlam 1990 - WWF Title Steel Cage Match
I remember hearing about this match and I did watch it when it first happened but never saw it again. So here we have a pretty brutal brawl, with both guys getting to bleed a bit. The highspot of the match sees Rick rude climbing to the very top of the blue barred cage and hit a flying forearm on the Warrior. I wasn't expecting that at all. I had no idea Rude was so nimble. Warrior wins by escaping the cage to a big pop.

5) Ultimate Warrior vs Randy Savage at Wrestlemania 7 - Retirement match
Probably Warrior's second best match, as Savage sold like a bastard for everything and timed everything perfectly. Action is back and forth the whole time, both guys hitting their finishers multiple times before Warrior got the final three count. This lead to Sherri turning on Savage and Elizabeth making the save... which lead to the reconciliation and eventual wedding of Savage and Elizabeth. Ah, shucks.

It's too bad that the Warrior doesn't appear on the DVD to give his side of the story. However, it's not the WWE's fault... he refused to appear. The documentary that would have been a tribute of sorts became what it is now, a scathing look at one of the most popular characters in WWF/E history. Guys like Ric Flair call him a flash in the pan and Steve Lombardi calls him the greenest wrestler he ever faced (knocked Lombardi out more than once during their matches). But then there are guys like Jericho, Edge and Christian who will give him his due and say that they were entertained by him even though his interviews were weird and he didn't have very many great matches. 

But for me, I agree with Bobby Heenan. He does owe every ounce of success he's had to Vince McMahon and the WWF/E. But when I was a kid, I was entertained every step of the way.

Well, until he came back in 1996. After that... stink-O-rama. 

The Self Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior gets 8/10 WHAM!'s."

"event","Let's see, what's new?

Worked an awful couple of shifts, sleep wise. I worked Sunday night (which required me to switch from day-mode to night-mode) then revert back for Tuesday dayshift and then BACK TO NIGHTS AGAIN last night. Ugh. Somehow I wasn't very tired last night, thank God. Eleven hours sleep will help you there I guess.

Despite working another nightshift, I had a good day yesterday. I had a great couple of hours with Wanda, I got up a bit early and we got to hang out for a while before I left for work. And, I got a call form work saying that I am on C-shift for the duration of my supervisor's away blending gasoline for what could be as long as two months. This is great news to me, as we the temps start to feel the autumn pinch when the vacation time dries up and we're back to covering sick time, union business and banked time. If I can stay on shift for the duration of October, that would be awesome. But staying onfor half of November would be even better. Good cheques and an actual schedule would be great, and then we're into Christmas vacation time so I'm golden. Keep your fingers crossed.

There's also talk of one of the lab fulltimers leaving and going out into the process area to work, which would hopefully open a spot for one of us to get a permanent job insteda of the temp racket. Again, keep your fingers crossed.

I'm in the process of putting together a Pikmin review. I'm on the home stretch of finishing that game, and then I move onto one of the many new games that have recently come into my posession. More on that later.

Oh, I picked up Day of Reckoning 2 for my birthday. It's pretty good, it's got a graphics overhaul (some good and bad points) and there's some upgrades to the fighting system. Some of the load times are slower in the create a wrestler feature but liveable I suppose. Which reminds me, I have a DOR 1 review to post!!!

I'm watching my Looney Tunes Golden Collection Vol.1 dvds right now as I type this, the Daffy Duck/Porky Pig disc in particular. Frig, Duck Dodgers is some funny shit.

Kehoe out!!!"

"event","Living near the University, the area is abuzz in activity again... after what I would call a pretty subdued summer. No big parties in the buildings (I haven't been disturbed even once trying to sleep early for weekend shifts), and no real trouble from the wacky locals.

But now, the new students are running around in their downtown best trying to be the coolest kid at school. Moms and Dads are proudly helping their young adults to move into their basement apartments and meet the new roomates. Everyone has that positive look on their face, ready to face the new school year... preparing themselves for the rest of their lives. 

Local businesses are cleaning up as the student loans roll in, I heard from a guy at Wacky Wheatley's once that they sell the most electronics right before Christmas and in the first two weeks of September. The bars on George Street are preparing for a week long End of Summer binge fest, eager for their inevitable piece of the Student Loan Pie.

The weather has been good too... clear skies, warm sun with a nice cool breeze. Great party, barbeque and drinkin' on the deck weather.

The evenings are getting even cooler, foreshadowing the coming cold months. The capris pants and tube tops will be replaced by stress hoodies and test cramming gym pants... roomates are starting to get on each other's nerves... Moms and Dads are sending money to pay for the new DVD players and X-Boxes. All a right of passage.

I love this time of year. 

Such promise.

Kehoe out."

"event","So my weeklong stint at work is finally over.

And tonight I'm taking it easy. Wanda treated me to Jungle Jim's and now I'm getting ready to settle in with Monday's RAW that I have taped. All is right with the world again.

Darryl, Sean and Conway showed up at the apartment Wednesday night, we played Donkey Konga and shot the shit. Interestingly, Darryl brought a cd with some wrestling videos on it. We watched a match on the TV through the laptop/s-video cable. It was a match from the mid 80's in Japan between Andre the Giant and some Japanese dude. It was a shoot fight (i.e. real) of sorts but there are some key points to the story behgind the match to note.

1) Andre was completely loaded.
2) The Japanese dude didn't know it was a shoot fight.

Sounds ugly doesn't it? Well it wasn't all that exciting really, Andre basically no sold all the guys offence... swatting his dropkicks away and collapsing on the guy while he helplessly tried to push Andre's 500 pound dead weight off of him. Some comedic value, but alot of standing around. Apparantly the promoter didn't want andre to win, but wanted Andre to make this up and comer look real bad since he was getting a big head. Anyways, the Japanese guy (I wish I remembered his name) just says to hell with it and walks away when Andre lays down in the ring and dares him to cover him. Crazy stuff.

So Ifinally connned.. errr.... convinced Julie to buy Animal Crossing. No word yet as to her opinion of the game... I'm sure that I'll see her at the mixer/drunk tomorrow to discuss... Can't wait to visit her town.

Kehoe out."

"event","So It's 4:13 am, and I'm about to leave for work. 

Yes, that's my routine... I get up at the ungodly hour of 3:30 to get ready for work, drive to Come By Chance which takes about an hour and twenty minutes and then work for 12 hours and drive right back home again. Insane, isn't it. I work at the oil refinery, and I wouldn't be doing it if the money wasn't so decent. I'm still temporary, but that's hopefully only... well, temporary.

Up until a month ago or so, the temps weren't on the overtime list. That meant we didn't get called until all the fulltime guys refused an overtime shift. That's changed and now with the summer months here, none of the fulltimers want overtime so we're getting it all.

Which is what today is for me, an overtime shift. Yes, that's sweet and all... my rate is doubled and next paycheck will be raised nicely.

The problem?

Darryl came home for his trip last night. He showed up here at the apartment at 11:30, dropped his gear off and went downtown to the George Street Festival with Wanda and a bunch of the Chemistry crew. And I had to stay home and go to bed so I could get up at this ungodly hour. Damn.

I can sort of see Greg's decision to never working overtime... you miss too much when you work on your days off, especially in the summer.

I am so getting NINJA LOADED this weekend coming.

5 more shifts to go...

Kehoe out."

"event","Today was the annual Flatrock Garden Party. It's church fundraising event with ticket spins for prizes and cash. There are always the classic turkey coldplate suppers too. Yum.

So anyway, I volunteer every year to sell tickets at one of the booths. I had a good time, our ticket booth did ok, but not as well as we could have. Why? Cause some of the guys at our booth were slack. There were five of us with six sheets of tickets to sell per spin. Guaranteed, I was selling 2 or more sheets every damn time unless I was helping a kid pick out their prize. One guy was just atandinjg there, and when I was empty he would pass me his to sell. It was REALLY annoying. We could have had some double spins for SURE, but nobody pushed it, nobody seemed to want to work hard. My buddy Andy told me they went through more than a box of tckets, while we still had half our prizes left when the guys quit. Ugh.

After it was all over and the men who sold tickets get together for a cold one or two (yes, it's still the MEN'S job in ol' Flatrock), I noticed a few things. There were two kinds of people there. Those who do the work and those who drink the beer and complain about how dead the Garden Party has gotten. How that when it started, it would go on until 8 or 9 o'clock with two shifts of ticket sellers. ""We need something to draw in the crowds"" or ""It's not like it used to be"". 

Well, is that a surprise? First of all, the sad truths. The Garden Party started 30 years ago or more with little or nothing done in terms of changes or improvements. There's alot more to distract people than spins on cheap merchandise. Maybe having the speaker blasting the Newfie tunes was enough before, but not so now. It's sad, but it's true. Secondly, at one time, a sense of real religious community was really strong. I felt it even when I was little. But that's almost gone now too. People don't have that loyalty to church anymore. No loyalty, no money to support it. Again, sad but true. The people from that generation who came out to the Garden Party year after year are now the 80+ year olds or have passed on. Who's left? Aging baby boomers and their elderly parents? Most people my age have moved on to find work elsewhere. They're not putting their money into our church. It's the way it is.

That being said, you can maximize what we do have but the effort being put in is questionable. These same complainers don't help organize, they show up late, they don't help set things up or clean up. They punch in their few hours and go have a beer and shoot the shit about how awful things are. Meanwhile the people who give a damn do all the work asking no reward. The same 10 or 12 people can't do the work of a whole community and still expect to be profitable. They try and they get by, but there's no time to be fresh. No time to change. And yet they complain.

God.

I did have a good time by the way, despite my annoyance. Enjoyed the sun and talked to people I haven't seen probably since last year or more. Andy and Colleen's kids won a bunch of prizes, and went home happy.

Three year old Jared won a full Transformers Constructicons set! Well, they were cheap plastic Constructicon knock offs, but they were exactly the same as the real ones. Formed Devastator and everything. Too bad two of them broke the first time we tried to tramsform them into well, anything.

"event","My regular routine in preparing for the switch to night shift tomorrow is to stay up reasonably late tonight so I can really sleep in during the day tomorrow and awaken fresh for the 12 hour nightshift.

I was going to play some more Joe but I'm afraid my reaction time isn't quite up to snuff. So tonight I'm watching my DVD of Roadrunner cartoons. It's a disc from the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Vol. 2. Highly reccommended.

But before that, we saw War of the Worlds earlier tonight. I liked it. A lot. Not for Cruise and certainly not for the overly sentimental crap that Speilberg likes to inject into his movies. I liked the sense of massive scale, the pure helplessness of the situation. As always, it's beautifully shot and in most cases no punches were pulled. People got vapourized right there on screen and the fact that the aliens were using human blood to feed and to fertilize their plantlife wasn't implied, it was shown. I hated the fact that everyone from Cruise's character's family survives and they really were waiting for them in Boston is crap. Sentimental crap. As far as the ending goes, ""<spoiler> I liked that the germs and microbes of our planet were what killed the aliens ""</spoiler> but Wanda HATED that. When the credits rolled, I believe she blurted, ""That was the shittiest frigging ending EVER!"" to the amusement of half the crowd in the theatre. Even Mom laughed at that one. So thumbs up for War of the Worlds, even though I'm SICK of Tom Cruise.

But yeah, Roadrunner cartoons.

I just laughed to kill myself at the one where Wile E. sets up 6 feet of railroad track between two bushes to get Roadrunner to stop for the railroad crossing. Of course, a train come sout of nowehere and runs Wile E. over. Totally nonsensical stuff. I love that shit. That and the catapult that never works. And the batsuit. And anything to do with a giant rubber band... or whenever Wile E. is so impressed with a scheme that he looks approvingly at the camera. You just know he's gonna get nailed.

"event","Cripes, this game is HARD

To describe the game in a short sentence, Viewtiful Joe is basically Kung Fu Megaman on Acid. You battle your way through waves and waves of robots of varying abilities while trying to make it to the end of the level to face the boss with a few hearts left in your reserve. Let me give you adescription of the previous level:

So show up on this city street and I'm instantly attacked by 6 kung fu white robots. I use my slow-mo moves to dispatch them. If I want to claim my bonus power up, I have to take on another pack of white robots along with three green flying robots who shoot missiles at me, which I have to punch to send back at them while kicking the crap out of the white guys. Them gone, it on to another pack of whites before moving onto the cowboy robots with guns. I can only stun these guys by PUNCHING THE BULLETS, while they jump around like loony tunes. I barely make it through alive when I get two cheseburgers for energy. whoop dee doo, two hearts. Then it's on to face two more packs of whites and then take down my mentor who kicks my ass over and over until I eek by him and get my new zoom ability. Then it's down to the sewer I go to face five tunnels of flyuing green guys, 4 packs of whites, two swarms of bats, another gun shooting guy. Oh I get to power up now? Fine, but I'm not done. I go back up to street level and take down a missile armed helicopter and more whites. Then it's two ballerina ninja robots and a shooting guy. Two more helicopters and an army of whites is next and when it seems like it should be over, I jump on top of this bus which careens out of control over a hole filled with radioactive sludge. I have to use my slow mo/speed up abilities to make the jump and not get killed. Yes, then i think the level is over.

But it's INSANE. I was beat to a snot when it was over. Then level 3 started.

Joe has got two difficulty levels, Kids and Adult. Stupidly I chose Adult right away. 
 
Now, I've been away from Joe for a little while, my mind have been whisked away by Pikmin during my late night gaming. But hey, the game still rocks. I've been spending the past hour just trying to get to the boss of the current level. I have to go through like 30 floors of a huge building to get to the boss at the top, a giant green rhino with a fiery axe and missiles to boot. Dang!

I highly reccomend the game, I haven't been this frustrated with a sidescroller in years.

"event","So I won't do a full review of RAW, but here's what you missed:

1) Carlito and Benjamin had a pretty watchable match until the intentional countout loss by Carlito. Hey, keeping the title is cool.

2) The wrestling talk show wars have begun. Why does this rule? Jericho is giving his best promos in years and Carlito gets the rub and a push. Works for me. Roddy Piper came out to steal HBK's interview but that was kinda cool too.

3) The Diva Search. Ugh, still the most wasted airtime on any wrestling show EVAR.

4) HBK gave a pretty decent interview about how he knocked out Hogan last week for the fans. Why does that rule? Cause it's a total lie. Why? When he slipped in the ""Showstopper, the ICON, the main event..."" line you knew it was. He wants the glory. He wants to be known as the best. I always said that it must drive HBK nuts to have to play along with Hogan's bullshit posing and stuff... and now the storyline is here. Sweet!

5) Angle nearly lost the gold medals in the Amgle invitational, probably the best of the lot so far. I almost believed for a sec...

6) Tajiri took Chris Masters to school, I really wish Tajiri could get a chance to show his stuff but that will never happen. Masters won with that crappy Masterlock full nelson, his second or third move in the match, after Tajiri kicked his sorry ass for 5 minutes and made look like an ass. 

7) And the big news... Matt Hardy is back! So here's the scoop. Matt and Lita have had a real life love relationship for years now. So the last few months while Matt has been off in rehab, Lita has been real life cheating on him with Edge. For real now folks, behind the scenes. Matt announced his displeasure openly and repeatedly on his website which resulted in unwanted negative reaction toward Edge and especially Lita on television. This gets Matt fired. So Vince turns the negative into a positive by turning Lita heel on her on screen husband, Kane and pairing her with Edge (they're both getting heat for being cheating jerks anyways). So inn the storyline, Lita has been cheating on Kane with Edge behind the scenes and that became the angle... which felt like a rib on Matt Hardy. The funny thing is that Hardy has been getting a huge face reaction form the crowd without even being on screen. Chants of ""We want Matt"" or ""You screwed Matt"" are heard during every Edge match now. 

...take a breath...

So last night Edge had another match with Kane. It was ok, Snitsky trued to help Edge, which drew Kane away through the crowd. This opened up the opportunity for Matt Hardy to hit the ring from the crowd and jump Edge. A big brawl ensues, and Matt gets separated and grabs the mic. He calls ""Adam"" a bastard and Lita a whore and tells the WWE to kiss his ass. He even plugs Ring of Honor (a smaller fed he's scheduled to wrestle for next week) before being taken down by a shitload of security and WWE personel. The way this was al presented to us the viewer was to seem completely real. The announcers said nothing through the whole thing, the security seemed a bit rough with Matt... no music played or anything. The camera was very shaky and got bumped around in the confusion as Matt got lead away by the mob. 

Was it real? No way... total work. For two reasons:

a) Earlier in the show they had a segment where Edge and Lita watching their wedding video and mentioned that the faux Matt Hardy bit was their favourite part. 
b) They had the camera on Matt for way too long if it was in fact a shoot. Why spend the time? Why not cut to a commercial if he was not an employee?

Now wwe.com is saying it was shoot. There's your proof right there. And now Matt Hardy's website is saying it was a shoot. Cripes, there's a link to Matt's site from wwe.com!

Work work work... but hey, that doesnt matter because it's one of the most interesting things to happen storyline wise in a long time. It gave the show that late 90's feel where anything could happen. I'd like a ""Loose Cannon"" persona for Matt, like dropping competitors names like ROH and real names and such. It could work I think... and unlike Brian Pillman he could physically be able to back up the character. 

So RAW gets 8.5/10 WHAM!'s for feeling like a fresh show... but loses some for the diva search and thus not enough actual wrestling... I mean 4 matches (two of which were less than 5 mins) in two hours is ridiculous.

"event","Actually, it was ok.

Of course my saying that may be some knee jerk reaction to all the negative internet buzz I've been plodding through.

Yeah, the acting was bad at times and the plot was thin as my patience during a 20 minute Triple H interview. But hey, the Torch was pretty great actually. He's a totally self-absorbed ass, and that's how he should be. The Thing was great too, I liked his look and the performance. It's the most well rounded of the bunch, and he comes off as very lovable. The interplay between them got some good laughs from me and Wanda so that's points earned by my standard. Too bad both Sue Storm and Doom were pretty bad. Sue is just plain wasted and Doom is just awful once he puts on the mask. 

Though from what you read online, you'd think it was the new Batman & Robin, but that's not the case in my opinion.

This is a movie the really young kids will like, though the Von Doom subplot may be a little stiff for some kids. Corporate buyouts and IPO's are not really kids fare. However, the origin stories and FX/action scenes will keep them happy. 

Comparing this to say the X-Men and Spider-Man movies, or even the new Batman flick is no comparison at all. They blow this out of the water. But FF is still innocent fun, a popcorn flick. As I watched it I thought of the first Ninja Turtles movie, actually. A ridiculous plot, an annoying female lead character and actors in rubber suits. But that movie was lighthearted fun, as FF is.

I'd rank it somewhere below Daredevil but above Elektra (or Catwoman, which I refuse to watch) in this modern age of superhero flicks. Not great, but at least your retinas won't burn from their sockets.

"event","So I just finished my second She-Hulk comic trade paperback. 

That is some funny stuff. The idea is that She-Hulk is a lawyer practicing superhuman law. So she gets to bump into all kinds of crazy cameo characters and the slick nods at Marvel continuity. 

Another cool thing is that in the Marvel U.,comics are published accounts of the adventures of super heroes and are admissible in court. 

For example,

There's this case where a villain sues Hercules, the Avenger for assault and battery. They go through old issues of Avengers to get past accounts of Hercules using excessive force. Meanwhile the defense uses comics to show how Hercules' has used his power to help people. It's pretty cool.

Plus there's the usual fighting and She-Hulk dealing with her dual identity - She-Hulk the outgoing ass kicking party animal and Jennifer, the soft spoken average girl. One and the same, but different. 

It's a great book, and I can't wait for the next ""Season"" to start this October.

Check it out. I'll probably do a full review soon.

"event","After having played with Wanda's new blog (fishcalledwanda.blogspot.com) a bit, I'm starting to come to the realization that maybe this blog thing may be the best outlet for my lazy ass. I'm continually trying of tings to make having my website simpler, which has lead to it's current FARK-like incarnation. It's not too bad, but now I'm getting annoyed with the comments links. Where does the annoyances end?

I figure that with the blog I can just post reviews that I usually write up in Word first anyway, and just copy and paste there. That way someone else gets to handle the comments and they get to host all the stuff I want to post. So I'll give that a try and see what comes of it. 

So keep l;ooking here for the latest reviews people.

Kehoe out."

I've been noticing some inconsistencies in the old site when viewed in either IE or Firefox, at different resolutions and sauch. I'm hoping this one mades the grade. We'll see what happens.

I'll be posting my various random ramblings here insteda of on the page, which in the long run is easier to do in the event I don't have any new reviews to upload. 

You can also post comments to get discussions going or on the website itself, hopefully it will all work out.

"event","It's a-snowin' here today... supposedly 15-20cm but it's gotta be worse than that. The wind is gusting to 90 km/h, and I'm sure I even saw a lightning flash a while ago. So what did that mean for me today? 

I played vdeo games, more video games and then watched Smackdown from Thursday night. It's been a productive day.

We played Super Monkey Ball, a game that I heard it was fun but never bothered to rent it before, figuring it was too kiddy. But it's easy to learn and VERY addictive. You're just a little monkey encased in a plastic ball, you run around different tracks trying to beat the time limit and your friends as you pick up Dole bananas. It's quite cool, innocent fun.

On the other side you have Prince of Persia: Warrior Within, the sequel to PoP: The Sands of Time that I bought a few weeks ago. The games are a mixture of Tomb Raider's jumping and flipping with the puzzle solving of the Zelda series. Add some sword fighting and a dash of fully animated cut scenes and you've got a pretty decent game. The original was a GREAT game, very funny and challenging as well. It was a great tribute to the original NES series, but now in fullly 3-D environments. The animations within the gameplay are exquisitely detailed. The only short comings were a somewhat limited fighting moveset and that the game was far too short. But it was definitely one of the best games I've played... cool, innocent fun. Now with the Warrior Within, the creators too the old formula and made it appeal to the lowest common denominator. There's lots of blood, half naked girls, doom and gloom all over the place. ANGST ANSGT ANGST. They went for dark and gritty and got annoyingly cliched, especially after enjoying the first so much. As Julie put it, ""They upped the teenaged boy appeal factor by a zillion percent"". It's still the same basic game, but I think all the blood and gratuitous butt/boob shots are comepletely unnecessary. Sure, if you want to up the maturity level from kids to teens, you do add some grit but not to the level they have here. I do appreciate the wider variety of fighting moves and a much longer quest, but the bads outweigh the good for me. 

We're watching the Samurai Jack season 1 DVDs now, they're great. I saw some of these before, but in the new TV and with the S-Video cable, now the colors are so vibrant along with the stories being so rich. Excellent television, one of the very best animated series (or televison series in general) that's been on in a long time. Again, pretty mature stories and action but done WITHOUT going over the top. 

Well, the big fight is about top begin... bye!"

"event","So I'm in the process of putting together some new articles for my website. For now, it's a Best/Worst of Wrestling 2004 article. More to come, a few DVD reviews and I'm seriously thinking about starting some game reviews. More specifically Gamecube game reviews. And I've gota  BOATLOAD of comics to review. We'll see what happens.

As for what's been going on otherwise... I'm on an extended period of timeoffedness, now that Christmas is over and people want to make money again. Of course that will only last a week since Lloyd Snow is retiring on the 13th, which puts me on days of the 17th for the time being. It could last for a week, it could be a year. who knows. At least there's no more nights for a while and three day weekends every week. So that pretty much keeps my schedule the same as Wanda's for a while. That's all good. Plus two and a half hours of overtime every week is sweet too.

The other night I had a good time chatting with both my sisters at the same time. On Messenger, but that's cool. That's what it's for I guess. 8) We didn't talk about much, just what's been going on lately but that's was great. For the first time in over four months!

My cousin Melanie was i town briefly the other night, on a stopover on her way to Moscow. To me that's crazy and way more adventurous than I think I am. She's going to teach over there for six months. I can't even seem to get out of Newfoundland for a vacation! It's a great big world out there and I think I'd like to do some travelling. There's got to be more than this little apartment and a refinery two hours away.

Well, I guess I'll go back to the website work, I've got my buddy Chris Kean waiting for me to post something!

"event","So it seems I'll be working tomorrow, thus cancelling the Tree Toss ""party"". But hey, three shifts is three shifts. You never know when work could get scarce, so I couldn't turn it down.

Another crappy thing is that I won't be able to go for coffee with Seano tomorrow before he leaves to go back to Manitoba. Even though I got to see him a few times during the week, but no real hang out time, you know? No guitar jamming, no coffee, no comic book buying. Oh well. This summer will be different.

So a word on the Chemistry get together. Like I said it was really cool, but what really sticks out is how it was like nobody was really gone. Stu and I started talking geek again, like old times. Even conversation with someone like Jim Fleming, who I didn't spend much time with back in the day and who has had very little contact since leaving home was totally relaxed and easy to chat with, no chitchat bullshit at all. And it seemed that way for everyone. 

Can't wait for next year.

Happy New Year!"

It was so great to see everyone again.

"event","Well, in my apparant never ending ability to rip off someone else's idea, I've decided to have my very own Christmas Tree toss. You see, that real tree we bought has been getting REAL dry, and the needles have been coming off at somewhat of an alarming rate. Well, to turn a negative into a positive, I decided the best way to get said shedding tree out of my apartment with minimal mess to my living space and the building in general is to toss it out the balcony door and to the ground below, wafter which it will be put in the dumpster behind the building.

Of course, I'm only on the second floor... but that's a minor detail. 

I'll wrap the whole affair around a small party here at the apartment. Could be fun. I'll probably have it on Jan. 2 or something. If anyone out there is interested in attending, let me know!

We also went down to Future Shop for their big Boxing Day sale. Yikes, it was PACKED. There was a lineup of 30 or 40 people to get in, and that was at 9:00 when they opened at 7:30! Well, we got a new tv (27"" Toshiba flatscreen) and a new printer (HP 1315 4-in-one). To accomodate the new tv we had to re-orginize the whole damn apartment, including yoinking Mom's tv stand she had stashed in the basement. It looks pretty sharp, so I'm glad we got it.

It was a bitch to get in the car/apartment though.

But Seano, Skylar and Justin were over and we had a pretty great time. I lost ALOT which is shitty in the obvious way but it's also a good thing that people who never played it before can keep up with the veterans.

We also watched a few matches including Honky Tonk Man vs Savage from Saturday Night's Main Event 1986, Eddie vs Rey from Halloween Havoc 1996, Eddie vs Malenko ECW 1995 and then Benoit vs Bret Hart Owen Hart Tribute match. All awesome matches, and makes me crave another Wrestlepalooza day, all 5-star matches, all day long. Though the last time we did it, I stayed away for a whole what, 4 days?

OH and the rum was EXCELLENT. Ta ta!"

"event","Ugh, my neck is acting up again. Is it ever annoying. 

It's like there a rope, one attached at the base of my skull and another at the center of my back, just between the shoulder blades. Now imagine someone cutting that rope, and tying the ends together so that the rope is just that much shorter, because of the knot in the middle. It's a tight knot too, so no matter how hard you push your head forward, there's no give and it hurts like a bitch right where it attaches. Oh, and add to that a hot barbeque coal right in your left shoulder joint. That's what it's like.

Ugh.

So I figure that I showed a little too much enthusiasm about the laptop at work the other day. As I walked through the gate, Brian said to me, ""So Jonnny boy, when you went home that morning what did you touch first, your laptop or your wife?"" 

I should just keep my big trap shut.

In other news, the Christmas season is in full swing. The Chemistry Department at MUN had their Christmas party on Friday which I thought was more fun than last year. Wanda and I had a great time, I didn't get off the dancefloor very often. Also, Darryl and now Seano are back for the holidays. We're going to have our first RAW party in a year here on Monday night. I've got lots of Doritos and Captain Morgan to keep the evening hopping. Too bad I have to work Tuesday night though.

Ugh, friggin neck."

"event","After some initial frustration with the Puralator courier screwing me around the weekend, we finally got the laptop on Monday. It weighs in at a hefty 8 pounds, but it doesn't feel quite as brutally heavy as I feared. It's fast and easy to use. Windows XP is a little new to me, I'm a longtime 98 user. And one of the lucky ones, as we haven't had a whole lot of problems with it. Sure, the bluescreen of death appeared from time to time but overall it's been pretty stable.

Anyway, XP has got me connected with my wireless router REALLY easily and so here I am, watching Mick Foley on my taped RAW while I browse the Internet.

Sweet!

We also bought a REAL Christmas tree today, the artificial one we got from my Aunt Evelyn was in pretty hard shape. It was cheaper to get the real one instead of paying the full Xmas price, and get a fake one during the Boxing Day sales. So the apartment smells really good, very Christmasy. Reminds me of  Christmas in Flatrock when Dad would cut a tree every year. Elizabeth and maybe Mom will be coming over to help decorate it, should be a good time. Plus a few rounds of Mario Kart should cap off the night.

Oh and it's finally snowed a little here in St. John's. It's very light but the city is finally a Marshmallow World.

"event","Tommorrow's the big day, the new laptop gets here!!! Oh man! We've got a Dell Inspiron 5160 coming by courier and I can't wait!!!!! Wanda is so excited to be able to play solitaire while watching Dr. Phil.

....<shudder>....

...Anyway, I was over to Mom's today to do some laundry, but this time I brought over the Gamecube to play on her new 32-inch flatscreen TV. Holy sweet adorable crap, it was awesome. My Day of Reckoning wrestling game never looked better. Chris Benoit was huge! I finally played a few minutes of Metroid Prime as well. I had rented it a few times several months back, and really liked it but I never got around to buying it until about a month or so ago when Walmart put it on for eighteen bucks. Anyway, I haven't played it since buying it cause I've been on a mad Wind Waker tear the last two months and finally finished it last week. 

I was so excited that I had to go and call Wanda's mom and my cousins who are all Zelda fans. <cough> geek <cough>

Well, the point is that instead of squinting to see everything on our smaller screen, it was easy to see evrything on Mom's. Wanda even suggested getting a new one if we get a decent tax return. Oh to dream, to dream...."

"event","So this year I'm actually in the Christmas spirit. 

I'm not so used to that, the last few years have felt pretty barren to me. On certain levels anyway. Two years ago, Dad was sick and we had what I figured would probably be his last Christmas. It was, and the following year was the first Christmas without Dad. So I didn't feel very Christmasy. Plus there's the usual bullshit that goes along with overcrowded shopping centres that never leaves me in a good mood. And last year I had to work most of the ""holiday season"". I was lucky to be one of the only temps to get Christmas Eve, Day and New Years off. I appreciated getting to spend time with Wanda and my family but I missed seeing all my friends that came home to visit. 

All that aside, here I am this year humming Frosty the Snowman and correcting people on the Mackenzie Brothers' 12 Days of Christmas. I still have to work through part of the holidays, I still have gifts to buy, I still miss Dad. Maybe my life and people around me are just a little more stable this year. I'm comfortable in my job, Mom and Elizabeth seem to be happy with their new house in St. John's, Rebecca is out there in Quebec getting a taste of real life and I've never seen Wanda happier since she's become so much healthier because of her asthma improvements and her weight loss. Life is good, and I'm ready to celebrate.

Plus I am totally zonked out on espresso.

"event","So I figure about every three or four months I pick up the ol' electric again to hammer out some tunes. That's no to say i don't play guitar much, but it's usually limited to the acoustic where we're living in the apartment and all. However on some rare occasions when I'm home in the middle of the day I break open the hardshell case, wipe off the dust and crank 'er. Most people in the building are at school or work around this time and there's no babies in the building from what I can tell. So the halls have echoed with Maiden and Sabbath the last two days, and my fingertips are blistered all to hell. 

It's a funny feeling when you've stepped away from something like guitar, come back to it thinking you can't remember a song and suddenly you're getting through ""The Trooper"" and ""War Pigs"" solos with relative ease with what feels like some sort of musical genius, if I do say so myself. So yeah, it feels pretty good. 

Makes me wish I was in a band again, feeling like I did when I was playing with my best friends in the world at the time. You might play horribly all frickin day but you get that one song right, the timing perfect, the groove tight... and you believe you could make it big. It was a moment when we were never closer, the world outside (school, girls, parents, the future) didn't matter and you were in the moment. It's was a pipedream, but I do miss it. 

And so jamming on my old guitar in my tiny apartment in the middle of the day gives me that little taste of that feeling.

Screw the neighbours."

I just dropped Wanda off at school, and I played an hour of DoR... and I feel like a bag of crap already. Ugh. Time to go get a shower and go do something. Too bad it's raining buckets outside. Maybe I'll visit Nan again and then hit the gym. 

Oh and mail that Wrestlemania 18 DVD... man, am I slack or what?

Is anyone out there reading this?

Hello?

Oh, I've discovered the beauty that is the web browser Firefox... nice piece of software, I like the pop-up blocker. Boo yeah!

"event","Well, I'm into day four of my lay off. Let's see what I've done thus far...

1) Watched the entire Star Wars trilogy back to back. 
2) Visited my Nan at the hospital.
3) Gutted the spare bedroom.
4) Created 19 wrestlers for my Day of Reckoning game.

Oh I can tell you what I didn't do... ANYTHING FOR HALLOWEEN!!!! Yes, that's right kids... Jonathan ""it's August, I'd better start on my costume"" Kehoe didn't do anything for Halloween this year. Sigh. The lament of the working man. No time for  costume making, no money to go downtown... 

Though Wanda and I did go to the Haunted Harbour deally downtown last Thursday. It was pretty sweet, they had the Grim Reaper lead you through a maze of hideous scenes like cemetaries, insane asylums, murder scenes, electrocutions, exorcisms, etc while people are jumping out at you with knives, chainsaws, drills and such. We were the leaders of our pack, and had to face everything first. Fun stuff. 

I think I might actually work on the webpage today. After I make chili for supper... MmmMmmmmmmm.... letting it simmer for a few hours......

Toodles."

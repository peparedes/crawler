"event","I hope the love in my heart right now&nbsp;never tarnishes or thins or gets annoying.&nbsp;
I wish I could give what I feel like a gift, a piece of the sky from my pocket...

I really feel like most people deserve so much better.&nbsp;

On that note,&nbsp; I feel like I owe an apology to someone, but I'm afraid I'll never be able to show her how sincere I am.&nbsp; I'm afraid she won't listen because I am the enemy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Girls don't let go of things like that. They know who you are, and they'll always hate you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It is a shame because I now realize we are so much alike, that, in some other world where we met at a different time and place, we are best friends.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;
I want to make restitution.

Her thoughts are so candid...I love reading what she has to say.

She doesn't know that I know.&nbsp; If she did know, she might freak out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then again she might not, but its...weird.&nbsp;And I'm weird. really really weird...
And even if all things went well,&nbsp; it would be awkward wouldn't it?&nbsp; After what I put her through?&nbsp; Because of who we know?&nbsp; Because of how we met?&nbsp; It just kinda sucks that I messed things up like that.&nbsp;

Sometimes I wish all the things that were ever said about me were written down in a book, and that from time to time, I could sample a page.
She will probably never know that I read entry after entry of her life.&nbsp; That I stop and think about her ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Its like looking down at people below you from the balcony.&nbsp; Thats my favorite.&nbsp; Those people have no clue they are being watched and pondered upon by a stranger.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have no idea that in some small way, without doing ANYTHING, they make an impression on someone they will never ever ever interact with.&nbsp;&nbsp; I love thinking about stuff like this.&nbsp; It blows my mind.&nbsp; The human connection.&nbsp;"

"event","<font color=""#330033"">There are several reasons I am reluctant to start writing: <br /><br />I already have a journal <br />People can read what I write <br />I can't draw little pictures in the margins <br />I still haven't found the magical print button that april assured me exists <br />One wrong click and you lose the WHOLE thing. (which just happened) <br /><br />But I want to start writing because: <br /><br />Theres something about putting your raw existance into words for people you know and don't to read and think whatever they want <br />Having an ""el jay"" sounds very beatnik and cool <br />Sometimes I need to hear the sound of letter keys being typed into my own words <br />Journals written on pages and pages of thick paper are heavy and take up space <br />If you make a mistake, you don't have to ink the whole thing out; you'll never have to worry about people being able to read what you didn't really mean <br /><br />I don't think a lot of my friends keep a steady ""el jay"" so thats a bummer, but I guess it doesn't really matter cause its more for me than anyone else. <br /><br />Its too bad this thing doesn't have multiple fonts, because typography can really say what you want it to <br /><br />p.s. I really love this little fox&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/appleplaid/pic/00002wb2/""><img height=""46"" alt="""" width=""77"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/appleplaid/pic/00002wb2"" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /></font>&nbsp;"

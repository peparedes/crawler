"event","I decided against entering the LJ writing contest I was looking at.&nbsp; There&#39;s just too much commitment required there and I am working hard on a publishing schedule now.&nbsp; Yeah, that&#39;s where I&#39;ve been.&nbsp; Publishing books.&nbsp; How about that?&nbsp; Didn&#39;t think that would ever happen.

It&#39;s a lot more work than I thought it would be, though!&nbsp; There&#39;s the writing, which is the best part, obviously.&nbsp; But then there&#39;s editing.&nbsp; Reading.&nbsp; Editing again. Re-reading. Tweaking.&nbsp; Sharing with beta.&nbsp; Tweaking.&nbsp; Editing.&nbsp; Re-reading again.&nbsp; Editing some more.&nbsp; Re-re-reading.&nbsp; Make Cover. Tweaking and twitching.&nbsp; Editing chapter seven. Re-writing chapter ten through eighteen.&nbsp; Sharing with beta again.&nbsp; Staring blankly at the wall while I recite chapter three&#39;s dialogue, again. Remake cover.&nbsp; Tweaking.&nbsp; Handing over to editor with fear in my eyes.&nbsp; Tweaking and editing based on editor&#39;s suggestions.&nbsp; Reading again.&nbsp; Editing that funny bit in chapter twelve.&nbsp; Nervous breakdown.&nbsp; Editing again.&nbsp; Tweaking.&nbsp; Twerking. Fiddle with cover one last time.&nbsp; Begging Beta to look at this scene again, PLEEEEASE!&nbsp; Final edits.&nbsp; Reading again and sighing in relief at the sheer perfection.&nbsp; Formatting for publishing.&nbsp; Swearing.&nbsp; Doing formatting steps again.&nbsp; Waiting.&nbsp; Waiting.&nbsp; Happy dance when book goes live on Amazon, Smashwords, &amp; Lulu.&nbsp; Take day off to gorge on sleep and candy.&nbsp; And finally, start again!

I always laughed a little when people said that it takes a love of writing and sharing your stories that knows no bounds to be an author.&nbsp; Now I laugh, but with the tired laugh of a person who knows it to be true.&nbsp; Though, it&#39;s all worth it when I log into my Amazon KDP account and see that someone in Germany or Australia bought one of our books.&nbsp; It really is."

And there are a million and one methods to do it. With this meme I am taking two of my favourite things and making them into one great meme! So warm up your music player of choice, get your randomizer out and let's make some characters for our imaginary RP!!<br /><br />Here's what you do: set player to random, list the first 11 songs that come up. Take each song and use it to fill in the categories as listed below. You can be creative and have fun with it! (get your songs before you look at the list! It's more fun that way!) There are no rules. The world you are playing in has no set reference points, but this is meant to be a parody based meme so going with the old cliques of sword and sorcery are OK, encouraged in fact!<br /><br />Now that you have a character, encourage your F List to play too by reposting this entry with your answers in the place of mine!<br /><br />And who knows, I might create a forum for facing off with our cracked characters.

"event","((edited to add LJ&nbsp;cut.&nbsp; oops!))<br /><br />the explaination:&nbsp; so I&nbsp;was doing this thing for the newsletter at work, and it's gone well so far, so I&nbsp;thought I&nbsp;would post it here, for my adoring audience.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am doing 5 helpful tips about different topics each month.&nbsp; the first month I&nbsp;did was November and I did writing tips, in honer of NaNoWriMo.&nbsp; The idea is that I put together useful bits of advice with my own snarky banter and create something worth reading.&nbsp; We'll see how that goes, huh?&nbsp; some of the ideas I&nbsp;use are totally stolen but presented in my own voice, so that's kinda like them being mine right?&nbsp; well anyway, here's the first one, and if it goes well, I&nbsp;will post new ones from time to time, hopefully once a month.&nbsp; Also, ideas about what to write about in future Helpful Hints are always welcome, as well as pimping this post to your F-list. *grin*<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""5 helpful hints""><br /><br /><strong>5 Helpful Hints from Hermie: <br />Writing Advice (nov 2008)<br /><br /></strong>November is National Novel Writing Month, and who doesn't want to write a novel?&nbsp; Sounds like great plan, but then you sit down to write something and all you get is the gibberish that comes from banging your head on the keyboard or a notebook full of doodles and grocery lists.&nbsp; So how do you take a desire to write a novel and turn it into one?&nbsp; <br /><br />The answer is simple.&nbsp; You write it.&nbsp; Just sit down and do it.&nbsp; Easier said than done you say?&nbsp; Not so.&nbsp; The first step, the greatest one you can take in writing anything, is making that first effort to convey your thoughts from brain to paper or computer screen.&nbsp; Once you have overcome that initial hurdle the rest will come to you.&nbsp; <br /><br />Remember that J.R.R. Tolkien started his epic tales of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings with a single sentence.&nbsp; &quot;There was once a Hobbit that lived in a hole.&quot;&nbsp; He didn't even know what a Hobbit was or why the damned thing lived in a hole, but from that single sentence one of the greatest works of fiction was born. <br /><br /><br /><b>Tip # 1 -- Don't Call It A Novel.</b>&nbsp; When you call your work a novel, then you have to divide it into perfectly sequential chapters and have so many pages, and format it just so.&nbsp; You are going to give yourself nightmares getting the chapter headings in the right places.&nbsp; Call it your writing, your story, your adventure.&nbsp; Once you remove the pressures of the word 'novel' you are able to open the creative floodgates that won't be constrained by logical divides of chapters, page counts or anything else that makes it a novel.&nbsp; Now that you aren't expecting yourself to do more than tell the story, you can get to the telling.<br /><br /><b>Tip # 2 --&nbsp; Just write it.&nbsp; Editing comes later.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing that snags most of us up in the writing process is going back and languishing over a turn of phrase, or a word we just can't spell to save our lives.&nbsp; A writer could get stuck on the same sentence for days if you are trying to get it just perfect.&nbsp; Instead of worrying over the details, typos, and lame flat phrasing, just write it.&nbsp; Get words out of your head and on to the page.&nbsp; Don't worry about writing it in order, don't worry about it being the greatest thing ever written.&nbsp; This is what we call a first draft.&nbsp; It's not going to look or feel like the books you pick up at the bookstore.&nbsp; But not a one of them just sprung into being in it's shiny finished form.&nbsp; Every book that you have ever picked up, started out in the same place.&nbsp; As a beautifully flawed first draft.<br /><br /><b>Tip # 3 --&nbsp; Don't Edit until you are DONE</b>.&nbsp; If you start the editing process before the story is told, you will find yourself second guessing your raw writing when it's time to produce some new material.&nbsp; Just set your work aside as you create it, and wait until you are done to go back and edit it.&nbsp; One of the most successful techniques I have is taking a couple days off when the story is done before picking it back up for editing.&nbsp; That gives your mind a couple days to calm down and distances you from the crazy raw process of creating the first draft.<br /><br /><b>Tip # 4&nbsp; --&nbsp; Make Time to Write.</b>&nbsp; Set aside a time during your day where you can focus on your writing.&nbsp; When your kids are quiet, the dog is napping and&nbsp;your real world&nbsp;problems are&nbsp;set aside for the day.&nbsp; Make a point to give yourself the some time every day!&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it's just 20 minutes in the car while you wait for the kids to get out of school or 45 minutes while dinner is in the oven.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can, make a ritual out of it.&nbsp; Make your favourite cup of tea, have a special pen you use or a special pair of pajamas you wear.&nbsp; What ever it takes to tell your mind, and the people around you that you are ready to write and focus on your story.&nbsp; It may take you a few tries to discover what works for you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people have to go to a special place.&nbsp; J.K. Rowling did all her writing on yellow legal pads in a local coffee shop for her Harry Potter books.&nbsp; Robert Kineck (children's book author) spends his first 20 minutes of every morning writing, to capture the ideas while they are fresh.&nbsp; Every writer has a unique voice and therefore a unique process to their writing.&nbsp; Find your place, time, process.<br /><br /><b>Tip # 5 --&nbsp; Never Leave Home Without a Notebook</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ideas have a funny way of attacking you in the middle of the supermarket, at a red light, as you are having a latte at lunchtime.&nbsp; They are unruly creatures who don't like to follow the rules you try and establish for them.&nbsp; You will find that creating a special time and place for writing helps to tame them, gives an outlet where they can be caught and contained on the page, however wild bursts of inspiration do attack when it is least convenient.&nbsp; Carrying a small notebook and a pen/pencil with you lets you have a way to capture and contain them until it's time to put them to work in your usual writing time.&nbsp; Any one who is a creative person of any sort could benefit from this tip!&nbsp;&nbsp; A half sized sketch book for artists can sometimes be a blessing too!&nbsp; Carry this notebook in your purse, pocket, planner, or in my case, spiffy anime messenger bag.&nbsp; Even guys can carry a messenger bag (or the oh so sexy man-purse!) and not look out of place.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hope my tips help!&nbsp; And if you want to see some more tips next month, feel free to send me a message with comments, questions or tips of your own that I can use in the next installment! <br /><br />&nbsp;</lj-cut>"

"event","so I&nbsp;got drug into this and well, fine.&nbsp; I&nbsp;can scribble a few drabbles, so here's the MEME&nbsp;thingie. 

Drabble it forward: Make a post inviting people to request drabbles in the fandoms you write; any number of commenters you can handle. But the catch is, once someone makes a request, they also have to post the meme, and drabble it forward. 

I will do the first ten (do I even have that many people on my F-list?) and anything after that is a lucky bonus.&nbsp;&nbsp; You are allowed to request mulitple times, though I don't care if you do it all in one comment or add multiple comments as you think of things. 

Give me a pairing, prompt and rating (tho I will prolly have to look up the ratings bc I shoulda just been a porn producer. rofl.) 

My acceptable fandoms can be found on my userinfo. 

DISCLAIMER: Also, I reserve the right to refuse certain pairings bc I have been asked for some weird-ass stuff before. 


(and from that meme from ages ago, I&nbsp;have started those stories, and hopefully will be posting them by Xmas.&nbsp; Fingers crossed.)

EDIT/addendum:&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not hold any requesters to the &quot;you must repost and write pronz too&quot;&nbsp;rule. It is now a gentle request, and nothing more.&nbsp; ^__^"

"event","<br /><p>So I got tagged by Rasvi for this 8 things meme, and Lily too demanded that I do it, so what the hell, here I go. 8 things people might not know about me.&nbsp; (and I&nbsp;apologise for the rant that some of them turned into!&nbsp;&nbsp; my bad.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Here's the stuff about me.  This is all the warning you get.  DON'T LOOK.  ""><p>1. Might as well get the obvious out of the way first. I am a Hentai. No, srsly, like EXTREME HENTAI. But the funny thing is that I am very, very picky about the quality of the porn that I read, look at, watch. Almost nothing squicks me (in the right situation, anything can be sexy.) I think that sex is a beautiful and too oft neglected part of life. I don't see the point in limiting sexuality and sensuality to just a very narrow and boring line of thinking. And that's across the board. I'm not just straight bashing. I think that it's cool that everyone likes what they like and we're all different so it's going to be to different degrees, even if two people like the same thing. But what really rubs me the wrong way is people who condemn others for their sexual likes. What no one seems to get is that 85% of sexuality is a fantasy. I find non-concentual sex to be very sexy, but that doesn't mean that I am out looking to be raped or rape someone else! I like bestiality art, stories or whatnot (gasp!) but that doesn't mean me petting your puppy is a come-on! I could go on and disgust most of you with what I find to be okay in fantasy, but I think that you get the idea.</p><p>2. I have sex for money. Well not real sex, but it's real money! My job that I keep referring to is thru one of those &quot;for entertainment only&quot; adult chat lines from the UK and I text guys on thier cell phones and we chat it up, get naughty, swap book or cd recs or just laugh at randomalities in life. It's a lot of fun, and I can't believe that I used to frequent chat rooms for the same thing for free! lol. The best part is, I never have to leave my house, I can work whenever I want, though I do have to schedule some shifts ahead of time but I pic when and what chat I am on. and I can make as much money per month as I care to work for, as I'm paid per message and while I have to meet my minimum, there is no max. (but as a side note, I would totally have sex for money, if the price were right and my partner didn't mind!)</p><p>3. I am married to fearnottheflame (who was formerly cadetmhughes), who most of you know as Nevi. And we is the Besties.</p><p>4. I am secretly an Uke (only about 30% of the time, but still.) I totally get all rapeface sometimes and want to be molested, abused, coddled and dominated. BUT don't try it on my Seme days because I a very scary Seme and will use you, make you cry and then let my tentacle beast has you! bwahaha.</p><p>5. I have a strong distaste for children. I don't 'awww' over baby pics, and I am never actually happy for people who have babies. I look at them and think, why? your life is over now. I hate it when actors, musicians or other artist types stop thier careers to have babies. Or when they are epic and awesome, have babies and then everything they do is about how amazing it is to have a family. I want to puke. I think that it's great when someone who is obviously suited for nothing but having babies and raising them has one. I still don't get all gushy about it, but it's cool for them, they are doing what they are meant to do. But so many people give up themselves to have children and that really brings up the bile in my throat, as I imagine they must feel whenever they look at the smelly little shit-factory they gave up thier entire life to care for. Also, for the love of GOD and all that's HOLY, if your child is now an adult, make them act like one! Don't let your worthless son live in your basement, jobless and downloading porn of the internet until you die! Make him get his own place, pay for his own internet and get out! You might be 50, but you have a life to live still! Don't let your 20 yr old daughter and her 4 kids overrun your house, and offer to help out by giving you a piece of her welfare check! *deep breath. rant off*</p><p>6. There are people that I dread running into at the Wal-Mart. Every time I leave the house, I say a little prayer that I will not run into any of the people that I used to know when I formerly lived in LaPorte, especially any member of my family. I doubt that any of them would even recognize me now, but I would prefer not to take the chance. I really don't want to even start in on that whole mess, as I haven't spoken to any member of my family in probably 5 years or maybe more and I would like to keep it that way.</p><p>7. I am a totaly geek for the TV on DVD thing that is going on! I love it. I wasn't allowed to watch much TV while I was younger and even if I did, it was always what someone else wanted, I never had a choice so I only kinda watched, and never really got into much or really liked much of anything until I was in college, and started hanging out with my friends more often then not and I got drug into the shows they loved and now I am able to indulge and enjoy all the shows that I wanted to watch but was never able to.</p><p>8. I have secretly longed since childhood to be a stand up comic. But the pay is for shit unless you are of epic comedy-rockstar status like Dane Cook. And I am not sure that my comedy is for the masses. I has like a brain and stuff. And I dont do poo or fart jokes. I can't stand toilet humour. Just can't do it. It's not funny, unless you are a 12 yr old boy.</p></lj-cut>"

I'm really starting to pull myself into alignment, and that's a great way to start the new year! <br /><br />Now if I could just work out some way to get my inspiration flowing for my writing. I&nbsp;hope that I&nbsp;do come up with something, as I've thrown in my name for this yaoi fan-zine thing that they publish on LJ and I&nbsp;need an original story ready to go in like 2 and a half weeks now, I've already put it off for a couple weeks.&nbsp; I'm so lame.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am hoping that I&nbsp;come up with something, as I signed up had no idea what I wanted to write!&nbsp;lol.&nbsp; oh well, it'll come I&nbsp;hope, in the 11th hour.&nbsp; But if the ever amazing F-list has a plot bunnie laying around that I can wrangle....... <br /><br />on the subject of writing, me and Nevi didn't make our NaNoWriMo word count (we got about 12, 000 words though)&nbsp;but we have an amazing story with characters that we are in love with and are planning to finish it anyway.&nbsp; it's actually looking like it could be a trilogy! or maybe bigger, there's that much depth in the world!&nbsp; I'm very excited about it.&nbsp; Sorry Lily, no snarky ukes in this one, but I&nbsp;am sure that you will forgive us! <br /><br />hmm and what else?&nbsp;really loving Soul Eater, laughing my ass off at the Bleach filler,&nbsp; watching some epic battles in Naruto with Seth (the 'rescue sasake from the barrel' arc, lol.&nbsp; Just finished Choji's epic amazingness! Falling in love with Naruto all over again.)&nbsp; Just finished Zombie Loan and waiting for the rumoured/mythological season two to make it's appearence, though I&nbsp;am so into the story I&nbsp;will got to the manga if I&nbsp;have to.&nbsp; Totally in love with Sainkoku (sp?), it's turning into WAY&nbsp;more than a cute love story, and I'm so into the story.&nbsp; Of course One Piece is epic. in Skypeia with Seth and at the start of Thriller Bark with Nevi.&nbsp; Reborn is just....&nbsp; wow!&nbsp; have to digest that bit by bit as it's getting insane (also we're terrified that we're not going to be able to find anyone who's doing subs anymore, what with Funimation throwing around C&amp;D&nbsp;orders like mad.&nbsp; They'd hit 3 of my fave series, SoulEater, D.Grayman and Reborn, right at the source.&nbsp; And there are a few more, but it's all so frustrating.&nbsp;&nbsp; what's the point really? no one's getting hurt here.) <br /><br />and now I&nbsp;am tired and going to bed, good night/good morning!&nbsp;&nbsp; hopefully I&nbsp;am going to be around more to make rambling meaningless posts but more importantly,&nbsp;I&nbsp;want to spend 2009 flooding my f-list with dirty fics!&nbsp;&nbsp; \o/ porn for the winz!!"

I'll also be on loober 3-5 EST&nbsp;Saturday and Sunday, and a bunch of days next month (all times are now 3-5pm EST) so if anyone can drop in and say hi, that would be great!"

The functioning of which is enjoyed by members of both sexes. Is usually found hung, dangling loosely, ready for instant action. It boasts of a clump of little hairy things at one end and small hole at the other. In use, it is inserted, almost always willingly, sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly, into a warm, fleshy, moist opening where it is thrust in and drawn out again and again many times in succession, often quickly and accompanied by squirming bodily movements. Anyone found listening in will most surely recognize the rhythmic, pulsing sound, resulting from the well lubricated movements. When finally withdrawn, it leaves behind a juicy, frothy, sticky white substance, some of which will need cleaning from the outer surfaces of the opening and some of from its long glistening shaft. After everything is done and the flowing and cleansing liquids have ceased emanating, it is returned to its freely hanging state of rest, ready for yet another bit of action, hopefully reaching its bristling climax twice or three times a day, but often much less.</font>&nbsp;<br /><br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />V<br />keep going<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />V<br />not there yet!<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />V<br />almost!<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />V<br />just a little more!<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />V<br /><br />So, what did you think that I was?<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />|<br /><br />|<br />V&nbsp;<br /><br />well, I'm really a .....<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>toothbrush!!<br /></strong><br /></div></font>"

"event","<p><font size=""3"">I was searching out a book last week and found the most amazing site where people swap books for free!!&nbsp; People list thier unwanted books and other people come along and ask for them! It's genius!&nbsp; The only cost involved is the person who is sending the books, pays for postage.&nbsp; But for every book you send, you get a credit to request another book!&nbsp;<br /><br />it's too cool.&nbsp; And if you are a greedy bibliophile like me and some of the people I know, you can buy book credits for like $3.50 or something like that.&nbsp; WAY cheaper than picking up something new.&nbsp; and it's a way better way than just dumping off books you don't want anymore in the Goodwill bin.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.paperbackswap.com/index.php"">http://www.paperbackswap.com/index.php</a><br /><br />Check it out!</font></p>"

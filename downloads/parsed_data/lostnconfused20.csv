"event","Well thought i would make an update since i dont think ive made an entry yet this whole year! :) Life is going good so far except i got some kinda food poisioning now so that sucked cause i was just at the gym working out and i stood up, got a bad huge rush and next thing i know im in the medical center with an IV in my arm, haha oh well they said my vitals were low and i looked pale as a goast! Well at least it got me off work for 2 days and i got some druggies out of it too that knocked me out in a hurry. So now im just sitting around relaxing and im just ready to get out of this place. 2006 so far has just been a huge headache for me for many reasons, being here away from all my family and friends and not to mention how the military has handled certain things has really pissed off alot of people here and back home but at least all those issues are being cleared up now and life is good on the legal side of things now in the military cause they finally believed what the truth was after 4 months!! There just a tad slow ;)

This deployment has in many ways been a good thing for me and my life, dont get me wrong i wish i would have been able to stay home and never come here but when its all said and done i will be a better person for all of this. Its made me realize how valuable life is back home and just made me appreciate everything and everyone in my life that much more. Im sure it will take time to adjust to being back home for me and everyone else there cause like my Colonel said here its like all of us in our minds are still stuck in March 2005 and our lives just stopped right then and there, but everyone elses life has continued to go on without us. So i know it will be very weird for me to be home and i think it will be weird for everyone else too just having me there everyday now cause im sure everyone is used to me not being there now so it will be different. But i cant wait. Everything will seem easier and its just going to be great for me to do everything i want to do now and continue on with my life without having to worry about leaving ever again, the past 3 years of my life i knew i was leaving in march 2005 so i felt like i wasnt enjoying life nearly as much as i should have been cause i was always just counting down the days instead of just enjoying every day that i had, hmmm most of my rambling probably doesnt make any sense but oh well! :)

So 2006 will be a great year after all i think. I got lots to look forward too and just cant wait to see what all happens and see where i go in life from here on out. I got Vegas on August 8th to look forward too, possibly NY in july or later in august and seeing all the family up north again should be awesome, my 22nd b-day on august 3rd - which will be my first one i will celebrate at home since i was 17 cause every one since then ive been at basic training, hurrican duty, or my army annual training, the counting crows concert on september 1st with amber and possibly the chili peppers at another time i still need to find out, and then all the other holidays i get to spend at home instead of this dirty dirka country! Im glad ill be home for Cols 18th b-day and new years too, its going to be awesome times. Also might be buying a house this year as well as a new car which im probably just going to pay in cash for so i dont have to make years of payments, and maybe ill be managing at shells by the end of the year. So i think this year will end on a good note and ill start to see which direction my life will take me. 

Well i think ive done enough rambling to last me a while so maybe ill make another entry before i come home but if not then all is well and i got less then 60 days now to go for sure :D Well im gonna go puke up my mystery meat now, grrrr i want some american food badly!!!!!!!!!! Later"

"event","Well im bored and just finishing up my day of work here in lovely kabul afghanistan so i thought i might as well do a quick update, not that anyone reads this anyways but its all good! WOW this year has really gone by fast for me and alot has happened that has changed me for the better. I knew well in advance i was getting deployed and i knew 2005 would be one of the longest years of my life and one of the hardest, and it has been, but i am happy that all this has happened to me in a way cause it opens my eyes up more to how good i have it back home and just all these experiences here are things that i will always remember. Ive become friends with some awesome people this year like amber, shannon, erin, and all my friends up here and im grateful i got people like that to come into my life, theyve all made things easier on me this deployment so thanks to that, you rock :) and of course my family has been awesome and it was great seeing them again for thanksgiving, jamie, titus, dan, jillian and everyone else back home i had an awesome time hanging out and cant wait to get back for good. 2006 will be an amazing year i think cause i will get my freedome back, possibly move out with jillian or someone else, going to the bahamas with amber, being debt free for a change, going to NY, and the list goes on and on! Good times ahead. So yeahhh im going to go eat some more subway cause thats all i eat now since the food here has gotten 1000000000000 cazillion times worse since ive been back! So subway and poptarts it is :) Oh and since ill probably be too lazy to update this again this year just wanted to say happy new years and never try and smash a camel spider with your rifle when its on your foot...haha <3"

"event","Wow haven't updated in a while so thought i would since i just woke up and had a good day yesterday. Woke up and hung out with titus pretty much all day and it was good seeing him again, like old times. We bought lots of food and played some games then went down to shells and saw tony and all my friends there, it was fun. Then we came back later and i cooked chicken alfredo and his friend amber came over, she seemed pretty cool, and we're probably going to the strip club later with them 2, james, and jillian. Life has been good since ive been back, alot of people have changed...and alot are still the same as ever but im just glad to be back home cause i see things much more clearly here i guess you can say. So anyways tonight should be fun and then over the weekend it should be fun hanging out with everyone sunday, probably going to see jamie next week too so that should be cool, haven't seen him since march so its been a while. 12 more days to go and i am going to try and make the best of my time here before i head back to the desert for another 5-6 months. Life is good."

"event","Well another week has gone by in lovely Afghanistan and now i only have 35 days till i come home so im happy about that. I finally think my head is completely cleard up and focused again and its good for me cause i dont feel sad anymore and just feel like me, its been a while since ive really been that way but life is good now. I also found out i will be home for 17 days instead of 15 cause the day i get there and the day i leave dont count towards my 15 days. Its going to be awesome, ive already made plans to go to Gainesville for a few days when i first get back cause nicole really wanted me to come up there and see her since she is off during the week, i was going to just get a hotel room but she said i could just stay at her place with her and lindsay so that will be cool. I told nicole she better keep that hooters outfit handy cause i gotta see that! Lol will be much different then the uniform she wore at shells, haha good times. Then i might stop by Lake Mary and see if crazy jamie is still alive, lol dont think ill call ill just stop by and flick him off, then maybe punch him =) Then of course partying with col, james, and her friends. Hanging with titus and kerry will be fun as always, lol kerry called me a stud and she wasnt even drunk! And finally i will end all controversy and pin that bastard titus for the undisputed championship, he deserves to lose the belt for fucking them turkeys in panama city! lol oh so fat... Its gonna be a good 17 days, just hope it doesnt go by too quick and i hope i get to see all the people i want to see, then i got just another 8 months and im done! If you all think you ever saw me happy before, you havent seen anything compared to how i will be when im home for good!!! Umm so yeah, oh and we had an earthquake here a few days ago, it was INSANE! I was in bed sleeping and my damn bed just started shaking like crazy and i really thought i had just finally snapped and lost my mind, it was like the movie excorcist when the bed shakes, lol but no damage here from that, 3000 people died from it in Pakistan i hear, i guess thats near me! Eh oh well, i still havent even figured out if im in Europe or Asia!!! Lol weird when you dont even know what continent you are in ;-) Anyways i have to go now and give some guy his papers that i did on him for a Court Martial since he banged down some chick behind a dumpster, lol dumbass, eh oh well. Life is good and ill see you all in 35 days...

I was feeling kinda down earlier just cause ive been doing alot of thinking but i got to talk to so many of my friends today and it really cheered me up the way they were talking about me. Thanks Britta, Lindsay and especially Nicole cause i really needed that and i feel so much better now! I will deff stop by Gainesville if you girls dont come down to seminole and we will have a blast! Nicole, andrew is such a complete moron ofr blowing things with you, especially with some ugly tramp too! I always told him not to blow things with you or else id beat his ass cause you were such a good person i thought. You made me feel great tonight too and im glad i got your email address again so we can stay close cause i missed you alot too. God i sooo am ready to come home and just enjoy life with all my friends again, its going to be sooo awesome hanging with all of you again! I dont think im gonna want to come back here :-) Well im off to bed so another day can go by and its great going to sleep with a smile on my face for a change.. Have a goodnight all!"

"event","Well ive decided that my sergeant is a dirty rat and he totally sucks at life. Day in and day out he fucks with me cause he doesnt like the fact that in the only low ranking person who has the nuts to stand up to him, i dont care what rank you are, if you i have a problem with you i will deffinitely let you know. He talks shit about me behind my back and trys to tell me i will never compare to this chick that was in our section, who he was banging by the way, and says im not half the soldier he is. I honestly think he is the sole reason why im not a sergeant right now, hell my Colonel and practically ever other sergeant ive met here have told me i should be promoted and ask why im not, fuck that rat! Lol well i realize im just rambling but had to get it out of the system ;-) Other then the dirty rat man life is good... 41 more days bitches!!! Oh and col and titus...you are both extremely fat and should probably go throw up right about....now! LOL jk. Cya all soon.

"event","Whew just got done playing football and now it hurts when i breathe! lol. Im the starting running back on the team and today was by far our toughest game, we won the first 2 by over 30 points and this one we won 18-12 but it was very phyisical. I had one play at the end where i was protecting the quarterback and the linebacker came in and tried to get to the QB so i had to jump in fron and i just got CRUSHED right in stomach area, that shit hurt but i got up and finished the game. I had a 40 yard run and just missed scoring by 5 yards but its all good, lol i didnt even notice till after the game was over that i was busted open on the knee =) Ah playing football is fun cause it really just gets my mind off of everything else, mentally this is probably the best ive felt this past 6 months and life is good right now. Ive learned from all my friends that i need to just focus on things i got control of and stop thinking of home so much and since ive been doing that i feel alot better. Thanksgiving is going to be sooo fun being with all the drunken family again and i just love that time of the year anyways. LOL titus we gotta cook another turkey when kerry comes over!!! Now that will be funny ;-) And since ill be there maybe ill even get james and col to come over since i know you bastards for whatever reason cant hang out unless im there! Im gonna smack all ya guys in the head and make you and james kiss and make up, lol or we can just keep it as is and make you piss off james which is always fun, either way we are going to paint either his room or his cats =) Col you gotta help ;-) Ummm lets see, im might go drive around to UCF to see sarah and UF to see the rest of the shells girls and my cousin, i got nothing else better to do so i might as well take a little drive and see all my friends. Hmm i wonder if jamie is still alive?!? LOL. Oh and i think my name got submitted for soldier of the year, they select 2 people out of the 300 or so here and we have to go to some sorta board and they ask us a whole bunch of questions. Thats kinda cool people here think that much of me to put me in for that, usually its guys that are in for 8-10 years. Anyways i probably wont win but its all good. Well im just about done here at work and im gonna go take a shower and change before i go eat, im starving!

"event","Well im bored and at work right now just listening to music. I just turned down an offer to go home in te next 2 weeks cause even though i have alot of people i really want to see i just dont really want to miss out on being with my family on thanksgiving, id regret it too much if i went now. Anyways life here has been good, i got a baseball game tomorrow and maybe more camels will walk on the field when we are playing again! That was awesome. It actually rained last night for about 2 minutes and i got soaked cause i decided to run around in it and come to my office in the middle of the night, lol i got my bosses chair soaking wet ;-) Im talking to Heather again which im glad about, i dont know what will happen there but guess ill just take things day by day and see what happens in 7 weeks when im home. Of course im still confused about almost everything but thats just the way life is for me but im happy so i dont mind being confused. Lol i think i broke my toe running last night back to the barracks, i slipped and ran right into this metal pole on the ground and now my big toe is all blue, lol it was pretty funny =) Things are going good here with everyone and we all are talking about a trip when we get back just driving around the country and enjoying freedom, it is honestly hard right now to even picture just being free and being able to do what i want to do, just normal life. People talk to me all the time and point out that if i stay in the military till im 37 on active duty then i can retire, but i just dont want that. Being here is being away from everything and everyone that i care about and thats why i still say my life is on pause till when i get home, i cant wait to just have everything in my own control again cause no matter how much i wish i could control things back home from here i know i cant, it sucks but its all good cause theres nothing i can do about that. Well now im just starting to ramble so i better go back to work. Life is good... <3 Later bitches =)"

Other then being confused, like i always am!, things have been going really good. The elections are coming up on the 18th so supposedly thats going to be the busiest its going to be the rest of the time im here. My mind has been on alot of other things but i have to concentrate on whats coming up now cause i promised too many people back home that i will come home safe, i have no idea what will happen during these elections but i do know that things will be ok. Ive been here over 2 months now and ill be home in just 2 months, i honestly think that no matter what happens before i come home that those 15 days will be some of the best of my life. Ive learned alot since ive been here and i know im a better person for it and i just cant wait to see all the people that have stood by me this whole time. I know ill always be confused but thats part of life cause i think if i knew and had all of the answers then life would be alot less boring, life is meant to be a challenge i think and i like it this way... Well im off to do some homework and then build another shelf in my room cause i keep on getting sooo many packages, i honestly have more food then i can even think of eating! lol. Later all."

I found out that Dave ""the insomniac"" Attell is coming here to Camp Phoenix on Monday and IM going to pick him up!! LOL how do ya like that Titus! You got your pic with him and now ill get mine, maybe a video too. So it will be just me, dave and one of my buds driving around in the desert for an hour on our way to Camp Phoenix with security all around us. And i KNOW hes gonna be wandering around the base all night cause thats just what he does and we'll probably bring him over to our barracks, light up some cigars and maybe make it on comedy central, lol how great would that be! Now those will be some good pics ;-) 
We start playing football on thursday too and im the starting running back on out team, its a 20 team league and we are the favorites to win once again. I built like 6 desks and 2 entertainment centers yesterday too cause we were bored. Im in the 60's now for days till i come home and thats gonna be a blast cause i cant wait to see my friends and family again, the support ive gotten while ive been away has been amazing and it makes me feel good to see all those that care for me. Anyways, gotta get back to work, i just pissed the boss off cause i told him i havent cleaned my rifle since we got here :-x Haha oh well...life is good.

Today has just been one of those days i want to be over with and just wish it never happened, and the sad part is i dont even know why... Its weird how in just a day i can go from ecstatic about everything to just confused and not knowing what to believe anymore. I honestly feel like this is deja vu all over again from last december and i hope im wrong but i just dont know what to think anymore, maybe im not meant to be happy or maybe it will just have to wait till i get home, who knows! I know i sure as hell dont, but i dont know what more i can do...i honestly dont. I'd be okay if i knew what was going on cause then i wouldnt have to wonder if things were about to come crashing down or if things were looking up, i hate wondering...i feel like ive improved so much as a person these past 5 months but still im completely confused and lost when it comes to life and people, once i think i got things figured out and boom! im confused again. Oh well, maybe thats how its meant to be. Well im done rambling now cause im just tired of it all, maybe tomorrow will be a better day, who knows...i sure hope so though.

But this was deffinitely a good reason too cause im just in a great mood today cause i heard from Heather AND i got to have a drink with ice in it lol. When i got her email and just saw everything she said it just made me smile for hours and i honestly havent felt that good since last time i saw her about 6 weeks ago in florida, i think things are deffinitely looking up for me now and for her as well. We both knew in Jan when she left it would suck for the next 18 months but now halfway thru things are looking pretty good and im probably the happiest ive ever been even though im away from home. Things are going great in Afghanistan and im getting into pretty good shape, even though i pulled my hamstring like 3 days ago so that kinda sucked, but i can hobble around now even though it hurts at least so life is good. Well only another 70 days or so to go till im home for 15 days and i cant wait for that, next to coming home for good next year those 15 days will probably be among the best i will ever have just cause ill have everyone i love and care about right there where i can see them anytime again and things will just be soooo great. Well i gotta go now and finish up my work for the day then go mail off my package for heather, then i think i might go build something for my room...life is good.

We saved some ducks lives which was very entertaining then i just watched her conduct PT with the people at her school. She said i should have conducted the PT, that would have been fun but the people there wouldnt like me cause i do some heavy PT! lol. Then we just went to Moes and ate some mexican food, haha i cant believe how many stores in that mall i never noticed before and ive been here for almost a year now! That was fun, just talking and hanging out. Then we just came back here and watched the simpsons and bad santa with the redneck which was fun, just hope we didnt bore her too much.

"event","Well i guess its that time of the month again....time to update,lol. I was just starting to pack things up and going thru old things and finally got done with what i was doing, now just sitting down and starting to think. What a strange time this is for me and for everyone else and i just feel very weird about everything. Its weird, but im not one bit nervous or scared of going right now, like i was last time, or  maybe it just hasn't really kicked in on me yet that im actually leaving for maybe a year and a half or longer, just about the same amount of time my dad was gone for a while ago. Thats a long time... Everytime i see someone i KNOW that it could be the last time i see them...till i get back of course... but it doesnt really kick in, i keep on thinking i have all this time to see everyone again but i probably dont. I have army drill friday and saturday so really all i have is 4 full days left to see people and say goodbye, kinda strange. Im hanging out with lindsey, nicole and brita early today so that should be fun and then who knows what im doing after that. Im actually prepared for drill this weekend already! LOL I finally didnt wait till the last minute like i always do! Im such a procrastinator =) 

Im happy with all the support and everything ive gotten from everybody, it does make me happy to see that others do care for me and will miss me. I heard from quite a few people that Shells isn't the same without me there. Tony, Col, Andrew, Nicole, Lindsey and Brita all told me that and ive only been gone less then a week! To all of them, just keep your heads up and stay positive, things will get better. 
Im glad for myself that im not really depressed about all of this, i really thought i would be but im so glad that it hasn't gotten to me yet. Like a friend told me, its up to my family and friends to be worried and miss me, and its up to me to be positive and stay safe so i DO come home. I always have to stay alert and take this training seriously because if i dont then theres a chance i wont come home, but i got my head on straight so i KNOW i will come home, i promise that. 

Being in afghanistan and before hand mississippi wont bother me too much, i can deal with that. But the part i will miss out on is my opportunitys here and just missing out on alot of things. I will miss seeing my sister grow up more and become an adult, who will be a senior by the time i get back, but i know col will be ok even if i know youll be sad at first. Thats expected. It will be hard without me here, i dont know if it will be like when dad was gone and i hope not, but just keep yourself busy and stay motivated with everything, time will go by fast so stay positive. And anytime you face something that you think is too hard or you dont think you can do just think of where im at and what im going through and then youll know you can do anything, its in our blood, we know how to persevere thru things and find a way to succeed. Lol and make that cd while im gone so you can buy me a house! =) Hmmm all my friends that i will miss you know who you are... Titus, Col, James, Heather, Jamie, Shannon, Erin, Marlee, Laura, the hostesses, Andrew, Cory, all the shells crew, and ANYONE else i forgot to mention! Thank you. 

Lol well guess i better stop short cause i dont want to say my goodbyes too early, still got another entry left in me maybe! Oh and anybody that does read this just let me know and ill give you my contact info too so we can write. Night everyone. <3"

"event","Well its been a long ass time since ive updated. Alot has happened the past month or so for better or worse and now here i am, less than 1 month to go before im finally gone. It feels like ive been having a countdown forever now, i remember when it was me saying, well i still have over a year, and now im saying 27 days instead, where has time gone? Its not really making me sad that its going by quick because im kind of anxious just to go and get it all over with, then i can start my life and not have to change the way i do things because i know im leaving, its almost as if i havent been able to be me because of all of this. The thought of being home and having everything i want next year just excites me when i think about it, ill be in control of my own destiny. I know ill come home, i have too. Im glad ill be home in june too for about 15 days before i make my long trip, and ill also be home for 15 days sometime about half way thru, maybe for christmas or new years, that would be nice. I know its all coming and ive been preparing for it for a very long time, but it almost doesnt seem real yet even though i know it is. I will miss you all so much though and as long as my friends write to me it will keep me strong and get me thru all of this. Ive met so many great people the past year here and im thankful for that... titus, heather, erin, shannon, jason, nicole, lindsey, andrew, cory, and so on are just some friends ive made in the past year and hopefully will be friends for life, i value them more then anything in life, besides family of course. Eh im off to bed now so i can get my 3 hours of sleep before im off to the army tomorrow at 6am. Oh and if you didnt know, my official date for leaving is march 18th by the way.

"event","Wow, i cant believe how these past few days have gone for me, the ups and downs have just been amazing and yet also the worst feeling ive ever felt. I was working tonight and got a call from heather on my cell and she left a message saying that she had to leave for her program again for real this time and that she wanted to see me one last time... I was just in a state of shock the rest of the night at work and couldnt take any more tables, i had to leave. So i went down to the ice cream shop by the movies and met up with her and her mom there and i just hugged her and let it all out, and so did she. I couldnt believe that it was me saying goodbye cause shes leaving, it was suuposed to be the other way around =( Through all that we have been through i still have such strong feelings for her and i was just glad to know that she feels the same way, we even joked that were both getting home around the same time so we'll both be single at least! I know that ive made a good friend of mine mad for seeing her and im sorry for that, i know you have it in your head that im out to hurt you and ""stabbed you in the back"" again, but in no way was i looking to do that... I just wanted to feel truly happy before i leave, is that bad of me?? I was the unselfish one last time and said you could try and work things out with her, but it made me sad that the very next day she wasnt even your 1st or 2nd option anymore, she deserves better then that and so do you, you know how it is to be a second option to someone...it sucks, nobody should have to feel that way, not you, not her, not me, not anyone! So if you want to be mad at me then thats your decision, i have no reason to be mad at you so i guess ill just wait and see how long you want the silent treatment to go on this time, its up to you...

Well i dont want to say anymore right now because i just cant think about anything right now... =( I just wish i could fast forward to september 2006 and let my life begin again...love you all and thank you for being there for me...."

"event","I cant believe how fast time is going by this year, i just hope the next 2 years go by as fast as this one did. It was a good year and quite a learning experience i'd say. It was my second time being away from my parents home and first time where i had to actually pay bills and support myself, and even though i got extremely poor i enjoyed every minute of it. It made me appreciate money more and im not going to blow it on something stupid next time i have it all saved up. Its hard to believe ive been living here for almost a year now... Me and james have always gotten along great, for the most part, and me and titus have also always been able to get along for some reason too. Even when he was bad mouthed and he bad mouthed everyone else i just didn't get involved with all of that unless i needed too and we've for the most part just been on the same page, besides me not being a racist and me being happy of course! Hopefully he's trying to change again and stop being such a whore,lol, at least he's talking to col again which im happy about. So its been good living with them...

Work has been good, i almost quit this year but decided against it because for one, im leaving soon, and 2, its like another family there. Its even better now that i actually have family working there again, now col and maybe soon james again. I don't see col as much as james does and now she knows why! Cause i work almost everyday, so its good to see her more now, especially since im not going to see her most of her 16 and 17 years. So works been good...

Friends have come and gone. Jamie is still my best friend even though he is a fucking lunatic, but what else is new? Titus has become a good friend of mine the past year as well and i do appreciate that. Some old friends ive talked too have changed alot, or not changed at all, and thats good and bad. Mark, Kim, Jillian and even Heather and whoever else i forgot, ive tried talking to you and its up to you if you want to keep it going. Thats all i got to say about that... Some people i consider new friends such as erin, who is such an awesome person and i just wish i could understand better... :/ Andrew who is cool and my new drinking buddy, along with the hostesses nicole, lindsey, and the rest of the crew. Tony, Sean, Angie, and all the others at shells i consider real friends who would do anything i asked them to do, i say thank you. 

Next year... Ah next year is the year that i have been wanting not to come since i found out i was leaving in late 2003, but here it is right in front of me... I just want to appreciate the time i have left here in the US with my family and friends and hopefully save up enough money to take off some time before i leave, bills suck so i dont know if that going to happen with all the debt im in, but i hope it does. Afghanistan... Thats going to be my home this time next year, i can't even imagine what its going to be like over there and even though i think im going to be fine and im going to a part in afghanistan thats not to bad, i know in my head that anything can happen, this is war after all. And that does scare me a little knowing that i may never see my family again or my friends, or just enjoy freedom, but its just something that I have to do. If I dont go over there after preparing for it the past year and a half at my unit and training for how its going to be, i'd think so much less of myself if i did not go. I know no one else would, everyone i know wants me to just stay home and get out, but i can't.. I really would think so much less of myself if i just quit on this, thats probably hard for some people to understand but thats just the way it is...
I'll be fine, just another obstacle in my life that will make me stronger I think... 

Things will be so much different when i get home, I'll have money in the bank for a change, almost be done with the military, and will just be able to get my life going again. Start school, not have to worry about leaving anytime soon and just be free. Col and her friends will be 18 when i get back...wow. James will be almost a quarter century old and titus will be almost 21. I can't wait for those times, but for now im just going to enjoy these times im having now and create some new memories that myself and everyone else can think of while im gone and for the rest of our lives. Goodbye 2004, it was a good year...I hope 2005 is better for all and goes by just as fast...Thank you all."

"event","Well i felt so much better today its just amazing, i feel like all the dead weight that was on my mind has been lifted and i just feel fucking great right now =) Today was just a good day. I woke up kind of sad from last night still from the conversation i had with someone that i thought was a good friend, but i know better then that. I never once told that person something i didnt mean and never did a thing to her that made me deserve how she made me feel about a month ago and now just recently. But im going to move on from that and just try and enjoy life cause i dont ever want to feel like that again, but im too trusting with people and when they tell me something i take it to heart so i know someday ill get crushed again, but thats life i guess. It will all be worth it when finally i meet someone who actually likes nice guys who like to have fun and arent assholes! Are there really such girls out there though? Lol somewhere i hope! 

Me and titus had a coaster war tonight! He was just sitting here on the computer being lazy and i said lets go work out, over and over again. Then i tossed like 5 coasters at him and he started throwing back! So out of no where we somehow found like 100 coasters and newspapers and all this other stuff and we were diving all over the place hitting each other with the coasters! That was fucking fun! Then we randomly started to take new pictures of us just being weird, weird is good, i like weird. Him and james had a talk and i guess they might want to try and still live here when im gone, that would be nice. Titus is going to even try and get along with my sister, id love that cause i really dont when to be fighting over stupid petty shit when im gone, i know ill think of just how stupid that is and i just want them to all get along while im gone, that would mean more to me then any gift they could give me. Im glad he's taking a step in that direction because for all that he says about col, she really is a good person and he knows that too, so yeah... i hope that all just works out. 

Ummm pretty much its just been a good night and tonight should be fun cause im going to be at my sisters 16th birthday party then off to shells christmas party after that, my friend andrew is probably crashing here afterwards too. I didnt get to talk to erin today but its all good, at least she got the night off and hopefully did something fun! I want to see her again sometime soon, its been like a month now since we last hung out. I think she still wants to hang out, lol i sure hope so, but im still kinda confused with what she really wants =/, oh well its all good. I talked to kim for like 2 minutes and it was good to hear she was thinking of me, lol of course it was when she was vomiting but at least that counts for something! =) I miss her as a friend too, i hope we can hang out before i leave, ill just randomly show up one day and surprise her! Maybe ill do that for erin too! Hehe ill just come to her work and hopefully she'll be wearing that chicken suit of hers! =) Now thats a great mental picture ;-) WOot WOot! Too Hot! lol. Well im going to go work out i think then hopefully go to bed, its gonna be a long day tomorrow i think so i better get some rest. Happy Birthday Colleen! I cant believe your 16! Man im old, lol i keep thinking your like 5 or something! =) <3 ya's...well some of ya's...good night."

The rest of the night really sucked but im not going to go into detail on that cause it just drags me down, i dont know how im going to deal with this situation. Its going to hurt me everytime i hear anyhting and im just not going to be myself when shes here, i wish i could be... i really do, cause i think you guys could work out, but i cant hide how i feel and that sucks, but you do what you have to do as you told me, ill respect whatever you do and try and be happy with it even if it kills me. Ill get over it im sure. Well i could fill up 5 or 6 pages with all my thoughts right now but im not gonna do that, im just going to try and think and get some rest maybe if i can.

"event","well im not going to say much cause im just in a bleh mood, but im sorry for hurting you like i just did and i know it may not seem like much but i hope you forgive me cause this just sucks... I just need some time to think things over also cause i just dont want to spend my last couple of months here without us talking, your like a brother and weve both made decisions over the past month that have hurt each other and that does suck, it really does... I cant help the way i feel and i know you cant either, this is just a crummy situation and i wish things could be different. Well i dont know what else to say about that...its hard for me to talk about things like this, i dont know why, it just is...sorry im being all quiet, its just the way i am... sorry bro

I should be happy right now and i really have been besides all of this, things have been ok in my life the past few weeks. Ive been talking to kim alot recently and that has really made me happy to hear from her again, im glad we did before i leave. Heather and me have been getting along great and i just think the real her is just an awesome person, i just wish that whole situation couldve been different since we met, but we cant change the past i guess. Erin is just simply awesome and im glad we still conect so well as friends, especially seeing how different we are as people, lol, i still think shes just a great person and still just wish some of the confusion in her life could just go away, that be so damn great! lol well i dont know what else to say but im just going to try and get by all this and try and be happy, whatever happens happens...."

"event","Well im off today and very very bored right now! Last night was good, i finally talked to Kim for the first time on the the phone in about 13 months and it seemed we just picked up right where we left off, almost as if we never stopped talking. She didnt think i would want to talk to her or have anything to do with her just because shes depressed right now and just thinks she'd be a burden on me or something, i wish people would realize that there isnt much thats not going to make me not want to talk or hang out with them! The only reasons ill stop talking to people is if they lie to me constantly and if i cant trust them, its so easy to tell if someone is lying or keeping something from you, so why do people even bother doing it? Oh well guess thats just basic human instinct.. Anyways! So yeah, talking to kim was good cause i do miss her as a friend =) I hung out with heather the other night and just drove around and saw christmas lights, that was cool, but it was freezing out! Yes i consider 54 degrees freezing ;-) That was fun. Im supposed to hang out with erin today i hope cause i really dont feel like sitting here all day again and i already cancelled plans with another friend so me and her can hang out, shes such and awesome person, i just wish she wasn't so confused all the time like i am, cause sooner or later its all gonna come out again and shes just going to snap. I dont know what else to do there cause i guess somethings she might not want to say to me cause maybe there about me, i dont know but thats just a guess :/ Im glad she still likes me though and thinks im awesome, even if nothing ever happens with that because i just dont see her not seeing john anymore cause i know how much she likes him.. But its all good i guess :/  Well im out, hopefully having some fun today, damn its cold out! =)"

"event","Well im just sitting here on a sunday afternoon while james is at my parents and titus is playing paintball, im just very bored and nobody is home right now. I tried calling erin but shes out already i guess, i hope i get to see her later maybe or at least talk some more. Heather tried texting me at like 630am but im guessing shes still sleeping now too or something. And all of my other friends are working or already out... Its been a good week overall though for me, ive decided to stay at shells becuase of a few different reasons such as its like a second family there and i know im not gonna be here much longer and i dont really want to start over again at another job right now. Plus im finally making money again somewhat...so thats good. I got to see kerry and erin earlier this week which really made me happy, kerry is just a great person and a good friend to titus and me and just seems to make things more fun when shes here. Erin is just simply awesome and im really glad that i met her, we just seem to connect so well...at least thats what i feel, i hope she feels the same way but im so damn blind i just cant tell...lol. I know she can have so many other guys cause alot of people seem to like her so i just dont know why she would want me instead of them, but either way i just really want her to be happy whether it be with me or someone else like maybe jon if he ever gets his act together. Lol i hope she doesnt get tired of my babbling and my damn blindness cause even if nothing ever happens between us id still think of her as a good friend and id still love to talk to her everyday like we do now. But yeah im done rambling now..lol, so im off to my parents in a few then hopefully doing something tonight, later all!"

Havent done much this week except talk to Erin, but its been fun talking to her everyday and it was really good getting to hang out with her the other day too. She taught me how to do flips and other things, it was fun! She's awesome =)I just hope her confusion can go away soon so she can be happy cause she does deserve that...Umm I talked to heather too and she seems all confused about life but I dont think theres much i can do or say to help her out right now...Well im off to another long ass day at work =/ lol girls confuse me!

"event","Well thought id finally join the crowd and start one of these damn things. The past few days have been really shitty and i just cant wait to get this weekend over with and move on in life. I really was starting to like this girl i met and we hung out over here and had alot of fun the past week, then all of a sudden yesterday she decided to start putting moves on my roomate and even though he said no over and over again out of respect to me cause he knows i liked her, they ended up sleeping together. Just sitting hear hearing them at 4am going at it just drove me over the edge and i did about 6 shots of tequilla and just sat out by the water and thinked till the sun came up. I really hate feeling like this because it just doesnt do any good and I thought i learned that from my experiences the previous years. Why do woman have to be so damn difficult! She said she wanted to be with him to cheer him up because he's lonely, and i know he's lonely too but she knows that ive been like that for a year now and he is always having someone at least every couple of weeks, but i guess life just isnt fair sometimes and you have to take the good with the bad. There hasnt been too much good lately but i am grateful for those that i do have. I have a great family, couldnt ask for a better brother and sister, awesome parents, some good friends such as titus-even though hes as of now in bed with that chick, and some new people and old faces that are coming back into my life. Mark is a good friend still even though we didnt talk for a while, Kim im still trying to figure out as usual...i would love to have her just as a friend again but she hasnt called me and i gave her my number a month ago, but shes a busy person so thats ok. Some new friends have also been there just to talk, such as erin who is a great person and i really appreciate that. Im trying to find new things to do or old things that i used to do because it seems all i do is worry about being alone and thats just not the way to live life. Sooner or later good things will just start happening and i hope it comes soon because i only have another 6 or 7 months left before i go overseas and i want to enjoy my time as much as i can. I really have to start looking out for whats good for me because my main problem is that I always put others before myself because thats just always been how i am. Things could always be worse, oh well im done rambling for the night though!"

Lady (the puppy) is soooo cute!~! My Grammy gave me $20. I was like whoa dude...kuz I didnt think she was paying me. So we were there until like&nbsp; 4:30ish.&nbsp; The worst part was when I stepped in dog shit. Ya that wasnt cool.</P>
<P>After that we chilled with all of the guys! At first it was just Andy and Chris. Ethan couln't come out for a bit. Then we went to Denellys. ( I think im getting sick of always eatting there...) Then we all chilled in the garage kuz it was a lil bit cold out and Lizzy has chairs in there so it was all good. Haha I just sat on Ethan's lap. Of course  :)  Ya it was fun in there lol. Good times with thoz truth or dares. Then we all (Kelly, Lizzy, Ethan, Andy, and Justin) played hide and seek. It was fun haha. It was guys vs. girls. The guys kept scaring us haha. Lizzy and Kelly- The flag scared us too! Haha that was funny.</P>

Okay 1st I will start off with last night heehee...It was me, kelly, lizzy, ethan, and chris (lizzy's bf) all hanging out...well eric was there too but he was being a major jerk...ask the ppl who where there..I cant believe he was like that...well anyways me lizzy and kelly and ethan and chris and justin all went to Denellys for dinner...everyone already had their foor and me and ethan were inside still..(we all ate outside on thoz tables kuz it was so nice out) and we both were standing next to eachother near the soda machines...and some guy reached over him to get a number..and he was like ""oh sry are u 2 in line"" and were like nope we are just waiting for our food..and the wife of the guy goes ""ya especially on a 1st date""...me and ethan both looked at eachother haha..it was great...and i guess we had a study togethere in 7th grade but i didnt remember lol..but he did!!

then today was even better!!! <3 ... I got to ride on his pegs on his biek....it was so much fun!! then we went to park..and all day lizzy and chris were like ""ye we think u 2 shoudl go out!"" and me and ethan talked more..then we went to another park..i rode on his pegs again...and me and him sat next to eachother..lizzy was on the bench too and chirs was on his bike...then we went to another bench kuz chris and lizzy were like guys go to that bench and talk..and they were like ethan ask her out...and guess what Ethan and I are going out! hes such a gentlemen!! like seriously he is! hes so nice..and he makes me so happy....when we were walking home tho me and ethan were holding hands and guess who drove by? me and kelly's grampa!! i was like ""o sittt"" lol....i said hi tho..lol he was going to..but i love my grampa haha i was like ""hi grampa!!!"" lol anyways

then tonight kelly, lizzy, ethan, chris and i all went to the movies! we saw ""taxi"" omg that movie is so funny!!! Ethan and I held hands like all day today and at the movies! he had his arm around me too at the movies..and when we were holding hands he'd rub mine and i would rub his...but stupid me forgot a pen so i couldnt give him my number lol..but lizzy is going to kuz they live close and stuff..and after the movie we gave eachother this huge hug!!

today was just an amazign day!! and then i had Chicken and Chips for dinner so that made it even better!

<P>It all started when some one was throwing marbles at Ms.Miller. We all had to write down on a peice of paper who we thought was throwing the stuff. Tronge and Ashley where so pose to go to the office. Trong got up and walked to the front of the class and said ""Who snitched on me?!"" and Neriah said ""I did"" ...Trong told Neriah to stand up so he did. Trong walked towards him and Neriah stood there. Trong punched Neriah and Neriah punched back.&nbsp; Trong was pounding on Neriah. So then Brian Gillis got in the fight to get Trong off of Neriah.&nbsp; Then it moved to the back of the teachers desk. A glass coffee mug fell off the desk and Trong picked it up and went to go hit Brian. But Neriah pulled the cup away and he got hit in the face with it. Neriah got stiches and broke his nose. Blood was all over his face. Trong put Brian in a head lock and Brain was hitting him. Trong said ""let me go"" and Brain said ""u let me go first!"" then they both let go of eachother. Then trong walked out of the room... As this as all gogin on me, cara, and bryna where standing in the back shaking...we were so scared!!!! And the girls Ashley might still be in our class! But Ashley wants to beat up Becky because she said Trong started it and all that. So now we have to watch out for Ashley. Trong got exspelled...which is good. And i guess we are having a new teacher for a lil while now.....it was really scary...this was the short version but yea.....my class and i all got called down per.4 to talk about it. Mr.Corben said that he hasnt seen a fight like that in 4 years and how it was the worst.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

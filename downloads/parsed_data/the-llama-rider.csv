Maybe I needed some more quiet? It's been like a hibernation. A cozy one.

I went home for Christmas. There were problems (hazardous driving, tension with my brother), but it was great to see my family. We watched movies, played games, I made them mulled wine. I miss them- my sisters and mom, my snotty brother, my music-hungry friend S. I haven't told anyone, but it made almost want to move back to Michigan. At least, it made it so that it's a consideration. I'd consider it.

The school semester is just starting again. What have I been doing for the last month? Learning to relax and just play games when I want to. Building a solid, warm, real,  romantic relationship.

I took my earrings out on New Years and I haven't put them back in. I'm not sure exactly why. I've had one earring in each ear since high school. I forgot I had them most of the time. Not one person's even noticed they are gone as far as I know. Just a little less weight to carry, I guess."

"event","Tomorrow is election day. It's a state holiday here in Rhode Island.
 I have the day off. I've never followed politics the way I have the last few months. Sometimes, it seems like my whole day can lifted up or ruined by a new poll. Honestly, I can't wait for the whole damn thing to be over.

I doubt anyone who reads my thoughts here will be swayed, or perhaps even needs to be swayed, but what is the point in being here if I don't write down my thoughts?

I pride myself on independence. I've never voted for either a Democrat or a Republican for president. I've voted third-party every time. There is a first time for everything. This year will be my first.

I can agree that honest good-hearted people can have disagreements about how any number of aspects about the way the country can be run. But there are certain things that are absolutely unacceptable.

The most absolutely unacceptable thing I can imagine is to go to war without provocation. It's the most basic tenet of most everyone's belief system, religious of otherwise- thou shall not murder.
Bush may say that he was protecting people, but what people? Certainly not the tens of thousands of Iraqi's that were killed. Don't their lives count for anything? How about the  thousands of American soldiers lives? How much do they count for, Mr. Bush? Not enough for even a show of regret?

How many people died Sept 11th? A whole lot less than have died in Bush's war, no matter how you do your math.
How can that be justice? How can the man that made that decision still be in the running for our leader? When every reason he has given for this war has been found to be false?
Bush must not be re-elected. I will vote however I have to to make sure of that, as I hope others will too.

Please vote tomorrow."

Bigger than I thought, it is like heaven for geeky gothy people. We went to the Salem witch museum for the dramatically lit wax statue show and had a great time wandered the streets, poking into gothy shops and giant comic shops, trying on expensive victorian goth-wear and checking out everyone's costumes. I guess people dress up for the whole month of October there. Or maybe all year long????
It was great fun. 
Ended up at an Irish pub, under a picture of Oscar Wilde. Me and Wilde (as I'm sure many of you are sick of hearing me say) share a birthday, and I toasted him one and was content.

Thanks to everyone who wished me a happy b-day. The e-mail and phone messages made me very, very happy.

Feeling so untense, I realize how wound-up I have gotten over the last few weeks, since school started. My chest is unwinding all the bands of tension.

Life is a hectic mess that I'm working my way though. It's punctuated by moments of joy and moments of disbelief. Classes started a few weeks ago. It's my second and last year in grad school. One year from now I will be, with any luck, working as a school librarian. I'm having trouble imagining myself in this role.

I observe my first school Wednesday. Why am I so nervous?
How can I feel so incapable?

Beyond this, life has it's grand moments too. I love my Teen lit class. By the end of it, I'll have read 30 new books. I've read 9 already. I've also begun to play my Ukulele more. I'm systematically learning almost every Magnetic Fields song, as well as few Tom Waits. P and I played together one day, singing and her playing her Violin. 
P. I hold in my arms sometimes and grin. Kiss her long white fingers.

Stepped on a tiny piece of glass this morning. Stepping to the coffee machine, I felt a tiny sharpness. Thinking it a pebble or crumb, I pushed it away with the ball of my foot and it went in. A quivering ball of red on my dirty foot.

Classes start today and I'm not looking forward. In 9 months it will all be done and, with any luck, I will be a professional. I will have a lifetimes of ending summers, of classes beginning. I see myself, sitting on a stool, my hands folded onto the counter, waiting in the stillness of the library for students to enter. 
In the meantime, I have much to accomplish in the next nine months. It occurs to me that this was about the point where I dropped out of my first undergrad program in education- the semester before student teaching. Courage, I tell myself. You are stronger than you used to be."

I am hard for money. Security is slipping liquid from me. I've found myself thinking more and more about what I could due without. If only I could get to work without my car. It's almost possible. I've had to call my mother and beg like the dependant child I've never wanted to be. I paid my own undergrad myself without loans and I hate not having it all all right. 
Funny thing- when I called to ask, she was already planning on how much she could send me and offered more than I'd been planning on.

I went to the beach with P and Mossy (who now has a place and a job in Boston- it's so close! Yeah!) this last weekend. I loved being in the water, even though I am surprised at the saltiness of it still every time. I couldn't get enough of the water, even though it was still cold. I'd warm in the sun for a few minutes and only wanted to be back in. It reminded me of happy summer vacations. 
Held P aloft in my arms for a few moments and danced her in the water. Have I mentioned I am fallen in love? The movement of waves. Weightless and serene.
In the sun later  I turned to Mossy and said, ""My gothdom would never have let me enjoy this back when we first knew each other"" and my old friend smiled and said ""Aren't you glad your over that crap?"" and we turned to enjoy the sights and feel of a beautiful day.

I am sometimes annoyed and ocasionally frightened by the people that come in for wacko conservative books, but I do believe people have the right to read what they want. This book too of course, but the people that come in for it are a bunch of hateful, ignorant, pack animals. The book is a near complete fabrication- eyewitnesses have verified it's inaccuracies. It's an obvious smear with the soul purpouse of keeping Bush in the White House. 
They don't care and they come in mad that we don't have it (we are sold out) and claim we are censoring it or strangely assume that I'm on their side and start babbling on how great the book is. It's not. 

I know you conservatives are scared. You supported a man who went to war for no good reason. It must feel horrible. Your desperate to feel like you are on the right side. It all sounds like Vietnam again. You were on the wrong side then too. That's why this must resonate so strongly with the grouchy old women and men who are coming right now to harrass the booksellers of America.
Get over it. Learn to admit you are/were wrong. Stop killing the truth and people.

Ithica is a cozy and very progressive hippy town. P and I camped at Buttermilk falls. The falls there are the prettiest I've seen, and the trail through the gorge was cool and full of wonder. Our campfires were nice, the nights were freezing. There was a strange, constantly smoking man with a broken arm and a can of O'douls coming out of the bathroom every time I went in. I got addicted to these Japanese cans of sweetened iced coffee called 'Mr. Brown' available at Ithica's Gigantic! grocery store. Our day and a half here was tranquil.
     Then Chicago. So much crammed into only three full days. We stayed with P's sister- who is an archivist and is every bit what you'd imagine from one- intelligent, organized, slightly distant. She was a wonderful hostess and we stayed happily in tree-lined Hyde park. She led us into the vaults and showed us rare books and papers from her Universities collection- T.S Eliot manuscripts, letters from Thomas Jefferson, yellowed scrolls in mysterious languages, first edition Moby Dicks.
 My sister showed me all downtown and the buildings swirled. At the top of the Hancock, I drank an expensive aged bourbon and sank into these views:

We went to Chinatown. We were stood up in hip Wicker Park ('Salright, I forgive you Ms. Transcribe- maybe next time) but found comic-book goodness at Quimby's (best shop ever) and also back downtown at the cultural center, a beautiful old library with a giant tiffany dome, 
<IMG SRC=""http://pic7.picturetrail.com/VOL198/1400437/2667643/64444688.jpg"">
where they were having a really fascinating exhibit on underground and indie comics. We sat on the beach and ate pastries and  went to see the neo-futurists perform fun and madness. I was astonished at my baby sister all grown up and directing us around town. How did she ever get so adult and confident?
P and I drove back through awful traffic, but we are arrived. It was stuffed full and next vacation will have more time to relax and more time for just the two of us, I think. It went well. I forgot addresses, so I have postcards, but I haven't sent them yet and they will be sent from Providence."

I first heard Casiotone when my marriage was falling apart. I ordered the CD and the day I got it, I sat down on my friend's couch and put it on. I was staying with her then. My friend came in, and then her girlfriend and we all three sat down to listen to one lonely guy and his little Casiotone keyboard singing goofy little songs about being sad. I wanted to cry and laugh all at once. Life was absurd enough and I needed that mirror. I listened to the CD over and over again those weeks waiting to move to Providence.

That same friend, now broken up with her girlfriend and moving to Boston, came down to Providence to see Casiotone with my new love P and I. I was expecting some handsome young hipster playing a fun game of a sad guy and his toy-like keyboards. Instead we saw the real thing. A bit overweight and shy, with glasses, a t-shirt, jeans that and a pair of converse. Awkward and polite, I wanted to hug him.
It was just a small room at AS220. Uncomfortable, we all sat on the floor with the lights all on. He said it felt like show-and-tell.

Afterwards, very excited, we all walked back to P's to sleep. I found a fancy gilt-looking frame in the trash. Long into the night talk. This morning, breakfast and a walk back to the train station with Mossy. I walked my frame home with the saddest funny song of pity singing me down the streets, across the park and through the graveyard up the hill to this computer.

Personally, the last few years I've begun to understand more and more about who am I and where it comes from. Previously, I spent my time comprehending my family and my early experiences. My sense of humor, for instance, comes from my father, as does my instinctual fear and distrust of men. 
Lately though, I'm beginning to see the broader social context of my identity. My self-righteousness and extremely keen belief in fairness, for instance, comes from an evolved protestant work-ethic (I was raised Unitarian, a good faith if you need faith). People are judged by their actions- you have to be <i>good</i> to go to heaven.
In the last 10 months since I've been living in New England I've found yet another identity. I am a midwesterner. In fact, I am a midwesterner with PRIDE. New England is full of smart, embittered people with an overdeveloped sense of irony. I like smart, embittered people. However, I can't help but think the ideal person is happy, kind and honest. I want to be happy, kind and honest. Don't you?
I find myself playing up my midwestern-ness. Amping up my good-natured charm. We are, as my friend A. says, affable people. We say hi and smile. We look people in the eye. You try and look people in the eye on my street here in Providence. Go ahead, I dare you.
Today, I was looking up a book by Charles Baxter named The Feast of Love. My friend K recommended it. It won the National book award. It looks good. It's also set In Ann Arbor, MI and was written by a guy who lives there. I just moved from there. I worked and hung out in A2 all the time.
I read this bit of the review on the book with a swelling, heartfelt pride:

<i>""Reviewers have often pegged Baxter an earnest realist, perhaps because he is a midwesterner and writes about midwesterners, (mostly Michiganders, <b>which might be the most earnest proper noun in our language.</b>)""</i>"

"event","Went to Newport yesterday with P., to see a showing of A's films at the Newport International. Took a ferry there and back. It still seems like a minor miracle to be able to walk to something that you get on and takes you to whole other place and you get off and walk to where you are going. And this time over water! One point for New England over the Midwest.
The films were good to great, but unfortunately Newport struck me as Disneyland for people who like the idea an old seaport. Nothing really to do other then buy brandnamed or Newport-embroidered crap and drink. While I'm all for drinking, a bunch of overly tanned commercial whores are not my idea of fun drinking companions.

The ferry was nice though. At night approaching providence with the light playing over the water and a slow hum- as S said and I was thinking too, like late night drives when you were a kid and you mother picked you out of the back seat and carried you to bed"

"event","Damned summer. I am uncomfortable to say the least. Luckily, sometime in the last few years I discovered I have feet. Feet that I can bare and walk around in and feel slightly cooler. Feet that I can look at the hair on and giggle quietly about, with toes I can wriggle. I can't help but feel more relaxed in bare feet. My pale feet are also set off so nicely by my almost always black clothing. 
Are you wearing socks? Take them off. I guarantee you'll be cooler."

"event","<i>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Bush (news - web sites), as commander-in-chief, is not restricted by U.S. and international laws barring torture, Bush administration lawyers stated in a March 2003 memorandum.
""In order to respect the president's inherent constitutional authority to manage a military campaign ... (the prohibition against torture) must be construed as inapplicable to interrogations undertaken pursuant to his commander-in-chief authority,"" stated the memo, obtained by Reuters on Tuesday.</i>

OK, so tell me if I start to sound paranoid...
But, I want someone to ask Mr. Bush <b>right now</b> if he has or has intended to personally torture human beings, or if he has or has planned to order others to do so. Because, I have to tell you- if he was not, then what the hell was this memo about? What other possible reason would be there for the existence of such a memo? 

It should be noted that, as far as I know, no other president has claimed (completely ridiculously) to have such  power to torture at will. Mr. Bush, we have to ask...  who the hell do you think you are?"

"event","Something I wrote about death for a 'zine my brother is putting out on the subject.

<lj-cut text=""The Disappearing"">

	It's been two years now since my father died and I still don't want to talk about what to do with his ashes. When my brother asks, I am sharp to cut him off. Despite all the protests he attends and angry slogans he writes, my brother is gentle-hearted. He touches softly. He lets it be. I'm the one that bothers myself with my own whys. I'm the one that's chewing his nails and pulling at dry bits of skin.
	It might be better to finish the process. The grieving process. Once upon a time, we were given black armbands and one year- no more no less. Now, we take and give what we will and maybe I don't want to be done with it. Maybe I'm not ready to put that last period on the end of my fathers life.

Dad, would you want to be planted like a tree?
		 	Subdivided like property?
			Scattered like seeding?

	My instinct is to keep him all together in one place, it doesn't matter where. My sister has talked about dividing up his ashes and putting parts of him in the all the different places that he held special. Part of him to go by the river he fished. Part of him to Luxembourg for the trip he never managed to take. Parts of him to all the things he took pictures of as he weaved around the country on his epic road trips. My sister loves this idea. She is young and her gestures are as grand as she's becoming.
	I don't like it. It seems like the magic to make sure that some evil dead will never return to haunt the earth. Stick a stake in their hearts, burn the body, bury the ashes in parts so that they can never come together again. That vampire is never coming back.
	My dad could sometimes play the magician. Breakfasts were a series of tricks. Toasts went flying around the room and apricot juice flowed in unreal and ludicrously long streams from the can. He was a performer for us. Maybe I just want to give him the chance to pull off one final trick.
	Even when you see a death firsthand it's sometimes hard to believe that it actually happened. If you don't, it's almost impossible to suppress the impulse to imagine that someone just made it up. One day your talking to them on the phone and then, a week later, they are gone. You keeping waiting for them to show up at your door with a 'just a joke' smile and a hug.

	When I was 19, I watched the then-love-of-my-life die of an asthma attack in the back of the car that was racing her to the hospital. I heard her last exhausted rattling wheeze. I breathed into her cold and unwilling mouth. I sprawled screaming on the concrete outside the whispering hospital doors. I knew there wasn't anything left in the body they pulled from the car.
	They didn't want to show us the body at the hospital. I didn't attend the cremation. That urn wasn't anything to do with her and even though I told her mother over and over again that Jaime wanted to be mixed with the dirt of a new tree and buried in a forest, last time I saw them, the ashes were still sitting in the living room, next to the fireplace.

	With Jaime, I kept waiting to find out that it was some elaborate conspiracy. That someone was keeping her from me, hiding her. The death was faked. Maybe she needed to fake her own death. She was just on the run.
	For years, I saw Jaime in crowds. Whenever a plump cheeked girl walked by, it was her. A woman with a different hair color, with sun glasses. I had found her out, seen through the web of deceit that had taken my young life away from me.
	
	With my father, it wouldn't be like that. It would be a prank. It would be a knock on the door and a broad grin and dark, pained eyes. He'd have lost some weight, quit drinking again. The small gap in his front teeth would show. The same gap I have.

	Pull it off dad. I can't keep you out of the ground forever. Knock on the door. Now maybe your last chance.

"event","Last night P and I drove into Boston to see the <i><b>Magnetic Fields</b></i> play at the Berklee performance center. First thing I walk in and see is a table of Andrew Bird CD's on sale in the lobby. Andrew Bird is the violin player and goofball who played violin with the Squirrel Nut Zippers and did some really amazing solo stuff that at it's best was a creepy violin cartoon swing. Last time I saw him was at some bar in Ann Arbor and I think I was one of less than a dozen people actually there to see him. Now opening for the Magnetic Fields!
He did a great solo act with his violin and a guitar and some live looping from an effects peddle. Big drama. At a few points he had these huge swirling violin loops playing, and he played a small chime and whistled the same tune and began to sound like a musical equivalent of the feeling I got as a childhood atheist looking at old religious paintings- full up and huge.

When the Magnetic fields came on I thought I might be let down after the opening act- but was immediately taken aback by Stephin Merritt. He perched his tiny body (I think he's under 5 feet) on a high stool, cradled his little ukulele under an arm and crossed his legs- showing his bright green socks. Balding and with protusive ears, he looked like a pudgy elf.
Evidentially he's having ear trouble. We were asked not to clap. The set was all acoustic- cello, piano, guitar/banjo and uke. After songs snaps rang out like rain in a forest. They were charming and cute and quiet. You could hear people Laugh at the clever lines and sigh at the sweet ones. The music chimed like a music box- though perhaps a little thin.
They quipped about no smoking policies and offered candy cigarettes instead and when performing ""yeah. Oh Yeah!"", Stephin jumped and peeked out onto the stage to deliver his accompanying ""Oh yeah's"". Cute and touching. Loved 'em."

I guess I'll stop for a second and talk about the museum. Among many nice things the RISD museum has a giant wooden Buddha that I very fond of. I sat with it again Wednesday. Mossy left me with it for a few moments. 
I am not a spiritual man. People that discuss spirituality bother me. I can't think of anything less spiritual than talking about spirituality. So, I'm not going to talk about how I feel about the Buddha, but maybe a few words on Buddhism.
I am not a Buddhist. Buddha was a rich snot that lived in a perfect world. Then he had his bubble burst by a viewing of the slums. Horrified, he invented a religion that's sole purpose was to alleviate suffering. He was desperate. Desperate that he shouldn't be horrified anymore. He wanted people to have a better life. That's not bad.

His tactics were a little off. No suffering without want. I like wanting. He was a good man though- as I see it."

Lame.
At least it was at the cable car and I got sit on a comfy couch and quietly heckle it with my best friend from Michigan. I tried to convince her to see 'Super-size Me' instead, but she found the concept of that one too gastronomically unappealing.

Mossy and I have know each other since high school. A long and sordid tale involving death, friendship, dating and homosexuality. We can tell each other anything. She is, for me, the closest thing to completely unconditional love.
If any of you can ever manage to date someone then have them come out to you and then develop a long-time friendship- I highly recommend it. What would you have to hide with someone whose been naked with you? Jealousy isn't really an issue when you simply don't have the right equipment.
We sat outside and drank hot beverages in the cool night and discussed our relationships and pain and gently prodded at each others mistakes and warmly applauded each others successes. 


She left for Boston for the weekend to see another friend but will be back tomorrow.
Also this weekend- Lots of happy time with P, slight annoyance with roommate, calm."

Arrived and went to Boston Public Library- massive with courtyards. Walked through Boston Gardens- decked with tulips. Hit up the Lush store, where the smell was good but so strong my eyes were going to bleed (but I have some stout shampoo to use, beer for my hair not for my gut, goodness). I understand my various female friends that rave about this store now- the plethora of scents like a candystore and the variety and subtly of art. Went to the Institute of Contemporary art and saw an exhibit of Mexican and Mexico-related art. Favorite piece? A man painted a picture of an man hiding behind another mans lapel, had local sign painters repaint it, took those painting as a basis of a painting and had other sign painters paint from that, and so on and so on. Also, labyrinth of a used book store. Also, resale shopping at Garment District where I got a subtle and beautiful green shirt and P a Wednesday Adams dress.

The weather was warm and crossing a bridge the water gleamed and the teams of sailboats and Boston is beautiful and clean and so nice as make me uncomfortable. Were is the place for the poor? Where could I ever fit in here? I'm likely to stay in Providence where I feel more real and at home.

Was wiped clean and achy by the time we caught the train back. Felt good to be home. Providence is home and homey now. Like old home Ypsilanti used to be dirty cousin to Ann Arbor, Providence is to Boston.
Always like Ypsi better.


Speaking of Ypsi... Look, Michael Moore is now wearing my old alma matter on his baseball cap.

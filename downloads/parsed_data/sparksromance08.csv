"event","Hey guys.  I'm listening to RENT right now and it's just as good as I remember.  Phantom of the Opera is really good.  A lot better than I thought, but is it just me or is the whole movie about a totally twisted guy who hypnotizes a girl so that he can rape her!?!  Anyways I can't wait for New York, I bought stuff at Target today.  Putting the finishing touches on my Spanish projects.  That's about it so I'll sign off.

"event","Hey guys it's Sara.  I'm just updating my site.  I got the Avon stuff that I ordered so i'm happy about that.  I'm playing an awesome song in piano, Hero by Mariah Carey.  Also, I finished my Spanish diary and my country project!!  Today wasn't so bad, but it could've been better too.  Does anyone know Jake Sparks' e-mail address or aim screename??  Just wondering.  Didn't get to talk to Justin today, that was a bummer.  We had to move to different study hall classes because someone wanted to use the cafeteria.  Oh well.  Hope I can talk to him tomorrow.  I'm really getting exicited about New York, can't wait.  Talk to you guys later.

"event","I just finished reading Nicholas Sparks' Message in a Bottle and it was the saddest book that I've ever read.  Right now my head is pounding and I can barely see what I'm writing because I'm crying so much.  I needed to write in this journal how sad I get when I read romance novels that have sad endings.  You feel your own heart being torn up and it's hard to put it back together.  Plus, you feel really stupid that you feel that way, because it's just a book.  Then, you realize that you're crying because it's not just a book; it reflects how you really, truly feel as a human being.  That's what I want my writings to be like.  Something that people can laugh and cry over, just because it feflects how they feel.  That's what good writing really does.  Also, I'm thinking about how really sad my life is.  I'm sitting at home on a Friday night starting a journal online so that I can record the ""stuff"" that happens to me.  Just to tell you right off the bat, nothing ever happens to me.  Nothing fun or exciting or new.  I've never been kissed, never fallen in love, never even really had a great night.  A night where you don't have to think about other people or homework or the stress of the day, or what you ""have"" to do tomorrow.  And now I think I'll stop feeling sorry for myself and sign off.  Maybe I'll do something worhtwhile, or maybe I'll just sit around and ponder my nothing life.

"event","Some bitch called the Humane Society to tell them that my friend Nick was mistreating his dog, Carter.  They said he was too small and very skinny.

Umm.  He's a Boston Terrier, of course he's going to be small.  He was also the runt of the litter, and he's three years old.

My friend Alexx who works at the Humane Society recognized the address of the report, and told her manager that it was bullshit.

Nick loves Carter, he's owned him since he was six weeks old.  If anything happened to Carter (like him being taken away), Nick would be absolutely devestated.

I told him about it tonight, and he demanded that I give him Alexx's number to get more information for him.  Apparently they sent someone to his house the other day, but no one was home.

He's pretty certain on who the person is, and he's super pissed.  =(  I don't want Carter to be taken away, I love that dog almost as much as Nick.  He's my second favorite dog next to my puppy Liza.  I hope this thing blows over soon."

"event","The idea that a guy could come between two best friends, two of my best friends, and quite possibly ruin everything is sickening.  Granted, he is very cute and a very nice guy and it's not his intention to turn them against one another.  He is also a good friend of mine.

Friend one has had a crush on him for months but never made advances.  Friend two met him through friend one but kept her distance up until recently.

To make matters worse, my two friends live with each other.  Friend one was helping her parents move out of their house last night, so she wasn't home.  Friend two had some of us over, including this boy.  They ended up sleeping in her bed... though I doubt they did ""anything"".  She likes him and he likes her.

Friend one doesn't know that he spent the night, but knows that friend two and the guy like each other.  She is understandably upset, but at the same time she's being rather selfish.  She's considering getting back together with her ex-boyfriend who treated her like dirt (at least for the last few months they were dating) but promises that things would be different.  She has also being hanging out with a guy who she works with, but is significantly older than her (about 18 years).  Then she also claims that she doesn't want to date anyone right now.

I talked to friend two today and she was upset that friend one was mad at her.  She asked me for advice, and I wish that people would realize that I suck at giving advice.  I'm a listener, and that's about it.  Usually when people tell me their problems, they wind up working it out themselves (which is how I function).

I've been in this situation before.  I had a crush on this guy for a really long time, and then out of no where he starts dating this one girl.  Now she's a very good friend of mine, and doesn't know that I had a thing for her boyfriend - they're so blissfully happy now, it's insane.  I was upset, but I moved on when I saw how happy they made each other.

Time after time, I've play the neutral party when two of my friends were fighting.  It's what I want to do now, but I'm leaning towards friend two.  Friend one has had her chances and if he doesn't like her in that way, then she should just realize it.  I would hope that she's mature enough to see that those two are happy together, although I don't want to tell her this.



I want to stay away, but I know I can't."

"event","I work in a crappy restaurant that is going downhill fast.  The restaurant itself isn't shitty, rather nobody likes to clean up their own messes or do any actual work.  They just opened in December and they already have a terrible rep around town (and in a town of 60,000, that's quite the accomplishment).  The owner practically lives there because he's OCD, paranoid and just plain fucking crazy and is afraid of being ripped off by someone.  Everyone is out to get money from him, or at least he thinks so.  He has one other person running the restaurant with him, but she's 20 years old and pretty much does all the work.  I feel bad for her sometimes becasue she practically lives there too (I'm not exaggerating either, they shower and sleep in this place).

Unfortunately, I am the best server there.  I don't do anything special, I can just handle having more than three tables at once and I actually do WORK.  Nobody does their job and I'm constantly picking up everyone's slack.  I usually work lunches, and when I open in the morning, the bar and dining area is always a mess.  Always, always.

Um.. hi.  Remember the restaurant you work at?  Yea, you need to keep it clean.  I've written a note... A NOTE!  I never write notes!  I came in the other morning and it looked like they had had a party after closing.  Writing a note was the bitchiest thing I could do at the time considering the servers who closed the previous night were not readily available for me to yell at.

I've never worked in a place like this before.  I'm vying for a job at a new restaurant opening up on Main St (cha-ching!  Main St is where it's at in Dubuque) that will undoubtedly be busier and nicer.

I need to make a shit ton of money in the next few weeks so I have spending money for Vegas.  I'm going the 23-27 with my mom, her friend and her daughter who is my age.  This is a much needed vacation on my part, although I've been on permanent vacation from school since graduating NICC in December - the day after my 21st birthday.

And that pretty much sums up my life in recent months.  I'd bore you all to tears with an update on my life since I last posted.

I have been on a Bob Dylan kick the last few days.  I bought a book by Spin magazine that recaps the last 20 years of alternative music and I now have a list of artists/bands that I need to listen to."

Taylor and I were a little late to arrive.  Yes, I'm the kind of person who likes to get to parties early.  Fashionably late is no longer fashionable, people!

We were greeted by an already drunken Fincel showing off the puddle of puke in Ann's driveway.  I'm not one to stare at vomit, so I quickly made my way inside.

Opening Ann's kitchen door, I was greeted by a heartwarming, ""HEEEEEYYY!!"" by a group of friends playing Asshole.  That is such a wonderful sound to hear when you arrive.  I wish that would happen whenever I arrived anywhere - work, school, mall, funeral, anyplace!  It instantly uplifts your spirits and makes you feel welcomed.

Courtney and I announced our marital engagement and we danced, danced, danced to The Pixies, Ace of Base, French Kicks, and Action Action.  Nothing gets a party started like a mini dance party in the kitchen!  Shawna, Ann, Sara, and others all joined in at different times.

Umm... blur blur blur blur blur....

Desi's soiree last night was ten tons of fun.  Rafters is such a cute restaurant, and very romantic.  Unfortunately, Desi and I couldn't have much alone time.. hahaha.  I suppose it could be romantic if you were with a significant other.  It's a little on the pricey side, but nothing too outrageous.  My pasta was $12.99, and then the waitress added an 8% gratuity to each check because we were a larger group.

Then we went back to Desi's coworker's apartment.  The snow was really coming down which made driving somewhat difficult.  I made a wrong turn onto a street that wasn't yet plowed and almost got stuck trying to get into someone's driveway.  I love how the snow held off until yesterday afternoon and was literally dumped all over town.

Played the usual drinking games, got a little crazy, played some Catchphrase which is kind of hard when you're intoxicated.

"event","I don't think I've attended church since my cousin Morgan's communion many years ago.

My grandma used to take my brother and I to a church that has since been demolished and replaced with an off-ramp.  My brother stopped going at a fairly young age claiming that he didn't believe in Jesus.  I soon followed suit and said the same thing.  Since then, I have only attend church a few sporadic times with friends or family.

For awhile, I claimed to be an atheist because of all the bad rap that certain religions were earning themselves.  It seemed like God was saying some pretty terrible things about some of His ""children"" and I didn't see how I could believe in him then.  I know it wasn't Him who was saying them but some loud mouth fanatic who claimed so.

I realized that claiming to be an atheist was far too harsh.  It was almost like I was saying that I hate God, and I don't.  Then I called myself Agnostic and kept up some sort of belief in Him.

The idea of organized religion kind of scares me.  They all have rules that I either don't want to follow or know that I personally could not.  I see no problem in simply having a belief in God and trying to be a good person.  Who's to say one religion is better over another?  I doubt that I could pick a certain religion out of the thousands of them that are currently practicing.

Or worse, I could end up in a cult.  The idea of wearing white robes and picking lima beans for The Leader does not appeal to me.

I have Kanye West's ""College Dropout"" currently in my car's CD player.  Eventually the track ""Jesus Walks"" came on.  Whenever I hear it, I really think about the words.

Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless Uhhhh!
Try to catch it Uhhhh! It's kinda hard hard
Getting choked by the detectives yeah yeah now check the method
They be asking us questions, harass and arrest us
Saying ""we eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast""
Huh? Yall eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke rental car from Avis
My momma used to say only Jesus can save us
Well momma I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone til November I got packs to move I Hope

Cuz we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers are role models we rap we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way yall need Jesus
So here go my single dog radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, video tapes
But if I talk about God my record won't get played Huh?
Well let this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreaming about
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out

I set the wrong alarm this morning.  Can you guess which one?  Yell it out if you know the answer!

Since I wasn't in class to fax it over, I e-mailed the rough draft of my article to my News Writing teacher.  We had to write about something for the NICC newspaper.  I decided that the new GSA would be a good topic, and the article only had to be one page, double spaced.

It was probably the crappiest piece of crap I ever wrote for an assignment.  You'd think that a one-page article would be super easy but it's actually hard because you have less space to say what you want to say.  Therefore, I blanked because I'm not exactly sure what NICC's GSA wants to accomplish.  I guess going to the meetings would help, but I'm going to the one at 3 and hopefully Mattie will be there.

We were suppose to pair up, learn about that person and their poster, and then present our partner.  I was kind of happy because I figured she would screw some things up.

My teacher made fun of me because I put ""Tomatoes"" under my list of Dislikes.  When I listed my favorite bands/artists (The Pixies, Louis XIV, The Faint, Rufus Wainwright, and U2) she said, ""Well, I've heard of U2, that's about it.""  Good times were had by all.

Actually, we were walking around Kohl's and ended up at the home interior section staring at a display of square plates.  I really like square plates because they're unconventional.  Alex said, ""We should buy these for our first house!""

The square plates were neat colors, but nothing too flashy.  You don't really want flashy plates because they distract from the food (Learned that from <I>Queer Eye</i>).  Alex and I agreed that it boiled down to the age old question:  Style or Substance?

<b>Style</b>

We didn't get into a very serious discussion about it.  We really just wandered around picking out dinnerware and pillows that we liked.  I wouldn't mind moving in with him because we're close friends and we'd have a good time.  The boy is going to be an interior decorator so you know our apartment won't be ugly.

I told him that if I were to move out, I didn't really want to stay in Dubuque.  He may have a chance at a job in Des Moines being a visual director for one of their high school's color guards.  Apparently it pays very well, and Des Moines wouldn't be so bad.  I guess I tend to think of Des Moines being really ghetto and dirty when it really isn't.

We could always go see Senior's guard at Vets each December.  :)  I've never been a spectator there before so it'd be a definite change.  Ever since Kelly wanted to move out after our senior year, I've wanted to have a nice apartment where I could buy cute, unconventional decorations for it.  I love looking at the home interior sections at Target, Kohl's, and Pier 1.

Last night's was no exception.  I was at an airport with a friend from elementary school.  We had some time before our plane departed so we were spending it at a used bookstore inside the airport.

The shelves were somewhat bare, but the books there were gold.  We found a bunch of books from series we used to read in elementary/junior high school.  Or at least, that's what I thought in the dream.  In reality, I've never even heard of these books, whatever they were called.

Suddenly, I stumbled upon a diamond in the rough.  The book looked like it was written at a third grade level and probably didn't exceed 15 pages.  On the cover was a large group of African-American pirates whooping it up aboard a pirate ship.  One pirate stood out in familiarity.

I read the title of the book which helped me recognize that certain pirate.  The title was <u>Bobby Brown's Adventure</u> or something close.  I realized that it was a series of books following Mr. Bobby Brown (yes, THE Bobby Brown) on an assortment of crazy adventures.  This particular book involved Bobby and his band of black pirates.

Sadly, I didn't get to read the book.  I was looking forward to seeing a bunch of pirates dance and snort cocaine.

Cocaaaaaiiinnee!!  Speaking of which, I'm watching <I>Blow</i> which is a fucking great movie.  Everyone should see this and become a cocaine dealer with me."

I came back in town from school and went to my Grandma's apartment to follow her to the car dealership so that she could return her rental car.  For some reason (probably because she's old) she had to drive on the small streets through neighborhoods instead of the main FASTER streets.  Then she made me take a right turn out of the dealership because the highway is too tricky to take a left on. 

I had to drive past the fairgrounds and through Asbury to get back to the Arterial so that I could drive down to John Deere Rd where her new car was.  For out of town readers, that's a hell of a lot of excess driving.  After she got her car, I had to follow her back to her apartment.  I feel like I spent about 45 minutes to an hour just driving which is more than I really like to do.

After leaving, I went to the Riverwalk and sat there for awhile because it was such a nice day.  I meant to do some deep pondering about life but I ended up being distracted by the cute ducks walking on the remaining pieces of ice.  So cute.  I love ducks!!  I also threw a couple of heavy rocks onto the ice chunks in attempt to break them but it didn't work.  After about twenty minutes, I couldn't stand how cold it was by the river and in the partial shade.

I have this pain on the right side of my back that comes when I'm sitting at the computer.  It's probably a result of sitting too long on an uncomfortable chair.  This is probably a sign that I should exercise more."

"event","So I'm thinking that my Psychology of Human Relations class is going to be about group therapy and emotions and shit.  We'll be subjected to circle discussions, feelings, and learn about self-love.

This means I'll have to emote in front of people.  I'll have to show more emotion than just cynicism and sarcasm.  Yuck, stupid touchy-feely stuff.

That's the message I got from the teacher.  Just the way she was talking about different situations we have to deal with (loss, stress, love, etc) sounds like some therapy middle-aged women attend to get in touch with the feelings they've repressed for so long.

But I get to make a collage about myself for Monday's class!  I can also find a song that represents me or I have special feelings for.

How about this one playing on Sirius right now:

<I>And I can't make it on my own
Because my heart is in Ohio

Cut my wrists and black my eyes
So I can fall asleep tonight
And die
Because you kill me
You know you do
You kill me well...</i>

That'd be hilarious, especially since there is an emo kid in my class."

First day of school today!  Hooray, finally something to pass the time.

Anyway, my Intro to Mass Media class sounds like it should be fun.  It's all about media and how it effects our daily lives.  We also get to go on field trips to radio stations and stuff!

Environmental Science should be interesting only because I suspect that the teacher experimented with Acid during college.  He's way too excited about everything, even bacteria.  This class also offers field trips to students who are taking the lab (I'm one of them).  I guess we go somewhere almost every week like nature preserves and places nearby.

I hope my News Writing class takes field trip too.  The less time I have to spend at that place the better."

So now it's been a month and a half and I wish I had a job more than anything else.  My savings are dipping dangerously low, like they did in May when I only worked two days a week at Benjamin's.

Originally, I was for sure that $800 would sustain me for what I thought was only going to be a couple weeks.  Now I'm at about $280 and really wishing for Dad to call me with the money he owes for Birthday and Christmas.

I've scoured the classifieds so many times.  The only jobs either involved a degree/experience of some kind, heavy lifting, or something that I could never do (auto technician?).  I applied at the Olive Garden when I swore I would never work in a restaurant again.

I doubt that the TH is going to call me back.  I figured someone more experienced than me applied.  It's ri-fucking-diculous.  All this free time has left me feeling like I'm a useless person with no worth to society.  I need a job to occupy my time, especially with school starting since I'll need money for coffee, lunch, and gas (yes, coffee is very important when you have an 8 a.m. class).

Ann, Finny, Alexx and I went to Carlos O'Kelly's for dinner.  Ann and I discussed the name of the person who invented the restaurant and how Carlos is a Spanish name but O'Kelly sounds Irish.  I figured that his father was an Irish immigrant who moved into the area that is now known as Texas (this happened over a hundred years ago I'm assuming).

The infernal noise that awakens me from a peaceful slumber.  I reach out and flip open my phone to check the time.  Only this morning that noise was actually a reminder of a friend's birthday.  I curse myself for setting the reminder so early in the day - I assumed that I would have been awake.  Struggling with the choice of staying in bed or arising to face the cold, cold room, I snuggle further under the blankets to rest my eyes.  I debate whether to hit ""Play"" on my CD player to listen to <I>RENT</I> once more as I have a song stuck in my head.

In bed, I ponder over last night's antics.  Spontaneous trip to Perkin's because of the cop cars in the parking lot, trying to get kicked out of Wal-mart, and back to Charles' house.

I lay in that resting state for another thirty minutes before I think, <i>I should really get up</i>.  Unfortunately, my many blankets entice my lazy side, urging me to bury further under them and sleep away the day.  I make a promise to myself to not fall back asleep...

... My phone suddenly reads ""1:30"".  <i>Shit.</i>  I decide that now is a good time to get up.  I was for sure that I would not sleep so late since I had called it an early night.  3:30 may be late to some, but considering I have been staying up until 5 almost every night, 3:30 seems much earlier.

"event","<i>Lunchmeat</i> is a terrible horror movie from the 80s.  Not only is the acting terrible and the plot weak, but there's fucking cannabalism and decapitation in it.  I was grossed out but I was laughing at it's lameness the entire time.

I ate lukewarm broccoli and cheddar soup at Perkin's last night.  It was delicious after the waitress warmed it up.  We had to listen to a bunch of 16-year-old scenesters talk really loud about their stupid shannenagins, and then one (who I was in Theatre class with) came over and asked me to take a picture of all of them.  I love how she seemed to have completely forgotten me.  ""Hey, you were in my speech class freshman year.. no, theatre!""

Then Taylor, Jake and I hung out at Kwik Stop waiting for Charles.  They drank Von Dutch Energy Drink (FTW??) while I had some Rockstar.  Unfortunately, Jake had found <i>Lunchmeat</i> in Taylor's backseat (maye I shouldn't have claimed ""shotgun"" that time).  We somehow ended up back at my house to watch it, and Charles later joined us.

They found my mom's Truth Jenga game - it's played like normal Jenga only there are questions on each block.  You draw a block, read the question and give it to whomever you want to answer it.  Fun game.

Anyway, don't watch <i>Lunchmeat</i>.  It's full of psychotic rednecks and preppy teenagers, though I guess most horror movies have those.  Isn't it funny how horror movies are so popular but the actors in those movies rarely do any work after that?  It's like if you do a horror movie, you instantly lose all chance of ever working in Hollywood again - unless you're Naomi Watts, of course."

I think I'll use real money tomorrow if I can get in a haircut - I really really need one.  My hair is going wild, although anyone other than me probably doesn't notice it.

Christmas night is extremely boring since EVERYTHING aside from a gas station is closed.  Taylor and I drove around for awhile looking for someplace to go or someone to hang out with.  Everyone either had to work in the morning or were still occupied by family stuff.  Stupid families.

We eventually went to his friend Sam's house (the place I went to with all the emo kids who gawked at me).  One on one, Sam is a pretty cool guy.  Like I said, nothing was opened but we assumed that Wal-mart would have been.  We drove all the way out there, walked to the front doors only to find that they didn't open automatically for us.  They tricked us because the sign was on and so were a bunch of lights.

We went back to Sam's and watched the movie <i>Blow</i>.  It's pretty good, although I dozed off for a bit during it.  I was also distracted when two Chris's came by, completely wasted.  I really hate obnoxious drunks, I really do.  And usually the people who are obnoxious while inebriated are obnoxious during sobriety.  I guess some people can't handle their liquor."

At first I just laughed it off and failed to give him a definite answer.  But this morning I was seriously considering it.  It would definitely be a change of pace to Dubuque, and a major change of scenery.

<u>Pros:</u>
- I would leave Dubuque.  As far back as I can remember, none of my future plans involved me staying in Dubuque.  When I wanted to raise horses, I'd move to Kentucky, and when I wanted to be involved with music - somewhere east.
- It's a hell of a lot warmer in CA than it is in Iowa
- I'd be more motivated to persue my dreams of journalism because it would be a large does of reality
- The beaches - the mother fucking beaches!
- My mom has two friends that live there.  I met one of them when I went to San Diego, but my mom has known these two women since high school
- Like I mentioned, it would be a large kick in the ass to get up and do something about my life

<u>Cons:</u>
- It's expensive to live in California
- It's very far away
- What if I end up not doing anything other than just live there and work at the mall or something?
- Alex and I would really only have each other to fall back on
- I'd obviously miss my friends and family.  I probably wouldn't be able to see them more than once a year.

I don't really want to get my hopes up about this.  Although I'm optimistic, I still have a nagging feeling that this is just going wind up as another pipe dream.

Alex said that if I live there for a year, I can go to a state school for free/really cheap (I have to look into that because I don't think he interpreted that correctly).  I figured that I could either
A. Find a community college to finish my Gen Eds
B. Work full time for a year and earn lots of money.  During which, I could maybe do some freelance journalism for experience

I need more time to think about this."

"event","I got Lua all pimped out last night!  Yaaay!  My CD player is so fucking awesome (for only being $95 - I checked it out at Best Buy) and looks awesome in my car.  The only problem is that the CD player has blue lights while the other lights on my dash are green.

Other than that, it sounds great.  I decided on taking The Faint's ""Danse Macabre"" to be the first CD to play in because of the bass in the songs.

I met Taylor at BB and we cruised around a bit with nothing to do.  We ended up at Charles' house but nobody answered the door.  We decided on going to Country Kitchen and getting a bite to eat.

We then switched cars because I was sick of driving and went to the river.  It's a little cold to be walking down there at 12:30 at night.

Finally ended up back at Charle's and had somebody let us in (he lives in a boarding house) and we broke into his room where he was curled up on the floor.  

My friend's band, Hans Helmutt, is reuniting tonight for a show at the Busted Lift.  I've never seen them perform so I'm super excited."

"event","So my birthday ended pretty well.

My cousin AJ brought me a cake made by my aunt Marcia.  Get this, she made cake batter and then melted Milky Ways into the batter.  To top it off, she whipped up her own frosting of butter, chocolate frosting, and marshmallow fluff.

Oh yea, you can't eat a whole piece - well, I couldn't.  Especially after eating dinner.

Then I got to spend the evening with my favorite girls.  Dairy Queen seemed like a good idea until we remembered how cold ice cream is in mid-December.

I had a crazy dream last night that I thought was real.  I dreamt that Ann gave me something that I put in my coat pocket.  When I got home, I put my coat away in the wardrobe although I knew I should have taken that object out.  I woke up at 3am thinking I should get that out of my coat!  But then I realized it was a dream.

I can't wait for Thursday at 8pm to get my CD player installed into Lua.  =D  She'll be so happy, as will I!"

"event","So far it's been a good day - maybe because I've been in a really good mood.  I mean, it's my birthday, it sucks to be unhappy.

Last year I had serious cramps, to the point where I couldn't eat anything (delicious Chinese) because of the pain.  But I did test drive a new car.

Anyway, so far today I took a Soc test, bought a pair of mittens to match my scarf, and then met my dad at Pizza Ranch for lunch.  Although it's my birthday, I still owed him a lunch from when he took me to school one day.

Okay, so $14.96 was somewhat of a rip-off because the pizza there isn't that good.  You'd think a place called ""Pizza Ranch"" would have the pizza as their best dish.  I liked the caesar salad better!  The guy gave my dad a senior discount and I told him that was fine since I was paying.

My Uncle Jim, cousin AJ and Grandma are coming by in the next couple hours for dinner.  My mom is making my favorite meal of hers - it's really hard to describe but it's wonderful.  Hopefully then I can finally open some friggin presents!!  So far, all I've gotten was $20 from my brother and Happy Birthday comments - thanks guys!"

"event","So here we are.  In a little over 6 hours I will be the BIG Two-Zero!  Midnight counts as my birthday, unless you're one of those fuckheads who consider your time of birth as the beginning of your birthday.

Okay, so then how many hours away is 9:54 am?

My mom took me to Factory Card Outlet today so that she could find little gifts to include in her presents for her friends.  I wandered around the aisles until I came upon the aisle with the Over the Hill favors.  I saw one for 30 years old and thought ""That's going to be me in ten years.""  While the Over the Hill stuff probably isn't too funny when you're young, they're a surreal realization of what's ahead.

Getting old doesn't appeal to me.  I hate old people driving, and I hated waiting on old people because they can't hear.  I love my grandma, but it's often hard to have a conversation with her - especially on Thanksgiving when her hearing aid wasn't working.

Hearing aids?  Walkers?  Menopause?  What is there to look forward to over yonder hill?  Gravity will take its effect, unless I hit it rich and can afford regular plastic surgeries.  Maybe I'll end up a sharp old lady who drinks gin martinis (haha) and lies about poolside all day.  Or maybe I'll deterioate and end up in a home wearing a diaper and watching reruns of <i>All in the Family.</i>  Perhaps I'll be the crazy old cat lady who bitches about how dirty television has become and how kids have no respect... but I think I'm pretty close to that already.  Darn teenagers, no respect.

Sure, in the next years I'll graduate college, start a career, get married, maybe have a kid or two.  I'll earn wisdom and respect, gain experiences and travel to many places.  Right now, those dreams are only that, dreams.  They're centuries away from where I am now.

Will I live to see the apocalypse?  Will we finally develop into what imaginative scientists/cartoonist predicted we would be at this time?  Are we going to ride in hover cars, live in the sky, colonize on the moon?  Maybe someone will develop robots to do our house chores.  But in those cartoons and movies, everyone was in peak physical condition despite the fact that they had moving sidewalks and robots - we all know we're not anywhere near that condition presently.

What more do I have to look forward to?  More challenges, responsibilities, and hardships?  Maybe I''ll end up a crack addict with three kids turning tricks in East Dubuque.  Or maybe I'll become the editor of Vogue - yea, the latter sounds much more appeasing, with or without the cocaine habit...

Take it from me kids, 20 isn't all that fantastic.  I can feel my back going as we speak.  It's only a matter of time before the hip replacement and Bridge nights with Gerty and Ethel.  All I can do is live for the moment and plan ahead for my future.  Like the headline of my Myspace blog says:

<i>Hope for the best, plan for the worst and maybe wind up somewhere in the middle.</i> - ""Loose Leaves"" by Bright Eyes."

"event","I just got finished taking the worst test of my life.  I fucking hate math.

First off:  I failed to realize that the test started at 10 instead of 11 which was the normal class time.  Since we never finished Chapter 8, he took off the last 3 questions, which was good.

I am math-retarded.  Basic stuff I can do just find, but anything else is mumbo-jumbo to me.

The room was 1,000 degrees (Farenheit), which caused me to shed several layers of clothes immediately.  First my coat came off, then my scarf, and then my sweatshirt.  It probably didn't help that I was drinking hot coffee, but oh well.

I will probably never ever pass a math class for as long as I live.  If I somehow get a 70 in that class, it'll be a fucking miracle.  I will drop to my knees, praise the Lord, and start going to church because I would be so elated and grateful.

I really want to cry.  I really really hate math."

The John Belushi biography.  Pretty sure he likes Belushi, as do I.  I inherited a gene from him that tells me to like crazy comedy like Belushi, Billy Murray, Chevy Chase, etc.

I'm bored as hell.  Everyone is working or doing other things.

I got to see pictures from last weekend on Ann's photobucket site.  I forgot a few of them were taken, haha.

Instead of buying aforementioned book (I lacked the money), I bought myself a non-fat Mochaberry at Border's.  De-fucking-licious.  It helped lift my spirts that were weighed down by my worrying of several friends."

"event","The Christmas drag show was wonderful.  I was happy to see someone who I haven't seen since last summer.  We were good friends in high school (junior year) and I'm always happy to see her when she's in town.

Mark's house was another story.
- I need alcohol to live, it's part of my lifeforce
- I am now the only one of my girl friends who is single, which kind of sucks.  Obviously, I'm happy for my friends but at the same time, I'm like ""Ew, now I have to be a third wheel.""  I should be used to it by now.
- Parties usually bring out the best in people, but last night it started some serious bullshit.
- I got some sweet ass Sharpie tattoos courtesy of Dan and Mark.  I had Mario on one shoulder and Jesus riding a dragon on the other.  Then Dan somehow convinced me to let him draw the Rebel Alliance logo on my face.  I stopped him before he drew all over my face. 

Curse Charles for messing up my sleeping schedule.  Pretty sure that Mike is getting me the RENT soundtrack for my birthday.  I feel bad that he got me a birthday and Christmas gift when I have no intention of getting him anything."

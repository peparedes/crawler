The goal is to finish packing tonight and conclude as much of my thesis research as possible tonight, so that I can kind of relax tomorrow.  There's not much chance of that, but at the very least I hope to be more available to my family than I am with my nose in a book.

I still can't believe I'm going."

I have to bring more than a dozen books (all but a couple are for my thesis research), which doesn't exactly help matters.  Not to mention some research I have to finish up here, calling two banks, cleaning up, saying goodbyes and probably some other stuff I'm forgetting.  Maybe this will help me to sleep on the plane on Sunday!"

I just finished my second to last semester of college and am now at home for Christmas break.  The biggest and most surprising news of all though (and surprising for me too) is that I am going to Austria in the spring to study abroad at our Gaming, Austria campus.  I certainly wasn't planning on doing this, especially not during my last semester, but it sure seems that God is calling me to give up what I have in Steubenville and surrender it to Him, so as to grow much more across the Atlantic ocean.  Because of our school's program, I will have two 10-day breaks and a 5-day, plus three day weekends every week.  By May, I will have seen a good deal of Europe, which should be nothing short of amazing.  Now I just have to get everything ready!"

It was the funniest thing in the world to look around the room at the people I remember beginning school with all wearing the most scared looks on their faces.  The room was quite tense and everyone was on edge.  I was too, but when I was done with the six booths that we were required to visit, I took a look around and realized the humor in the situation.  No, I am not ready to graudate either, and yes, sometimes I get scared out of my mind, but at least it's comforting that a whole bunch of us are in this together.  It's strange to think back to the fall of 2002 when we were all fresh out of high school and trying to adjust to college life.  Now that we've made it, it's time for GRE's and job applications and wedding invitations and seminary visits and apartment hunting.  These past four years have been so amazing, and I am so grateful for my time at this school.  At least I am a lot more prepared for the big, scary world than I was four years ago ;)"

"event","I'm sitting in the nearly empty MAC lab at school, trying to figure out what I can fill this blank screen with in the name of keeping in touch.  It's hard to believe that we are three weeks into this school year.  And it's also hard to believe that this is my last.  All of us seniors are wondering why we thought students older than us had it all together.  We certainly don't know what we are doing.  So, is it a senior's obligation to look like he knows what he is doing, where he is going and how he will spend the rest of his life after a brief walk across an all too short stage?  We don't know.  So the task now falls to us -- a motley crew of 21, 22 and 23-year-olds -- to disover the meaning of being a senior and all of the do's and don't's involved.  One of last year's seniors comforted me with this thought before her graduation, ""There are always the grad students.  See, you won't be the oldest!""  Praise God for that!

OK, so enough rambling about senior issues.  Although, those of you who are seniors or have been seniors probably know exactly to what I am referring.  Anyway, I have to  go to work soon.  I am going early because I have to attend a student government meeting on behalf of Students for Life later in the evening.  I am learning how to handle several meetings a day.  Maybe that's preparing me for life after graduation.  Last night after a two hour SFL meeting, we went down to the coffeeshop and sipped smoothies on the patio.  Talking until 1 am was fun, but it wasn't good for my cold/sinus infection-like illness that is moving in my head.  It also probably wasn't good for my homework, but I'll get to that later.

I hope everyone is doing well and for the Crusaders among you that you are adjusting to ""normal"" life again.  Yes, I know, Crusade life should be the normal life, but you know what I mean."

We surprised them on Monday by standing on the back porch of their host family's house, with no knowledge on their part that we were coming.  The week went well, although it wasn't without its bumps and bruises.  Things frankly didn't start out as cheerily as we would have liked them to, but by the end it was difficult for both of us to leave.  They helped me a lot, probably without really knowing it.  Five days with the group and I feel like I have grown a few inches.  My devotion to St. Michael is much stronger.  My spiritual life improved.  And I got to know 2004 and 2005 Crusaders even better than I did before.  Praise God for His work and for this great blessing!

I will say, though, that I am looking forward to my first shower in four days and getting some more sleep tonight.  But, it was so good to live like I did for 10 weeks last year again.  It's funny how much I missed/miss it.  Who would have thought I would have been excited about blisters and sleeping on a gym floor?!"

"event","As much as possible I have been trying to keep up with anything in the news about the Crusade.  For possibly the first time, the Crusade has entered the world of unsolicited editorials and news blogs.  While at first it may seem like a bad thing -- the Crusade and its messgage are being ridiculed in these pieces -- it is actually pretty encouraging.  For one thing, ""You can't be Catholic and pro-abortion"" is getting a whole lot of attention, which is never a bad thing.  But the real encouragement is that people are sharing their own feelings on the subject, and many strangers are backing up the Crusade for Life message.  It is so refreshing to see other people quote ""Evangelium Vitae"" or explain the sacredness of life and defend the Church.  Fifty college students may be able, with a whole lot of God's grace, to accomplish a lot, but they are certainly not alone and are able to do much more with the help of others.  With everyday Americans joining in the fight for life, our point is well proven -- the heart of America is pro-life, it's just not openly recognized by people in a position to do so (media, politicians, etc.)."

Well, then look at the few times I have actually posted anything.  Last night my brothers and I played miniature golf in this glow in the dark place, and my one brother kept saying things like, ""That was a 4 but it should have been a 3.""  Well, I have only posted a few times, but with the amount of time I think about posting it should be more like 30.  Just kidding.  Anyway, I am not going to write anything else until I actually have something to write.  I think that would be wise."

I can't believe I keep doing these things.  I don't really have time for this, but I think I just need to take a little break.  But when?  We decided today to add tiredness to the effects of original sin.

Anyway, the modesty fashion show went very well and tomorrow is the pro-life conference with Fr. Frank Pavone!  It's also the feast day of dear St. Drogo."

"event","Yep, it's a big question.  Seemingly everyone at FUS goes to Austria to study abroad.  It's the opportunity of a lifetime.  People grow spiritually and emotionally and mentally and culturally and just about every other -lly that's around.  I hear about it pretty much every day.  I understand why it's a big deal.  Maybe even in a limited way my summer taught me how awesome such an opportunity can be. Well, I was never planning on going: money, didn't think my parents would want me to, etc., but last semester a couple of people got me thinking about it, and I went ahead and put in my $200 deposit.  Tonight was the first meeting.  The problem is that I don't really want to go.  I understand how great it can be, but I will be one of only a handful of seniors amidst a sea of sophomores and some juniors.  My friends will be back in Steubenville.  I can't be VP of Students for Life.  All kinds of other opportunities have to go out the window.  In short, I will be way out of my comfort zone.  I was still planning on going, even with these feelings, but tonight I heard more about the money issue, and it's a little bit more than I can swallow right now.  Plus three of the classes I wanted to take that are always offered, are not going to be offered in the fall.  And the meeting was two hours long, and there was no room because they smooshed all of the chairs together, and the girl in front of me moved her chair back to give her more space which gave me less space ... I really don't know what to do.  I don't want to go, but sometimes I feel that God is really calling me to go, and that I shouldn't stay back.  I know it's all about trust, but what if He doesn't want me to go?  What if my feelings to not go are God's way of telling me that I shouldn't.  But what if it's the devil who  knows it would be good for me?  Oh, discernment is so hard.  For someone who can't even make her mind up about what to eat for lunch, how will I ever decide whether to go to Europe or not?"

"event","When I checked my e-mail today, I was shocked to see 26 new e-mails -- no spam -- all real e-mails from real people.  Most of them were from Crusaders ... new Crusaders.  Praise God, there are  so many of them.  It really sounds like an awesome group.  Reading their introductions reminds me of the akwardness we experienced last year in May when we began trading information.  Nine months later, we are as close as family.

 So, my problem is that I am not going.  Pretty much everyone else who was on the Crusade last year will be on it again.  Except me and one of the girls who has summer classes.  And the thing is once a Crusader, always a Crusader, and I will still be doing media from home, but it's not the same.  I guess I know that the 2005 Crusaders will have the time of their lives ... and I won't be there.  Frankly, I guess I'm a little jealous.  I want to be there, but I can't.  And honestly, I don't think God is calling me to it.  Maybe He wants to stretch me even more.  He sure did that last summer, and the process continues.  But it's still really hard to read all of these great e-mails and realize that I will not have the opportunity to get to know everyone well.  And what's worse, I wonder if I will still know the 2004 Crusaders as well.  It's probably just the devil trying to bother me (it wasn't just on the Crusade, he never stops).  

 I guess it was a little overwhelming to sign onto my e-mail and have so many messages flooding my inbox, all talking about the summer.  And it's probably also because I hate change.  But God did say something about making all things new, so I guess I should just get used to it.  And we talked a lot this summer about how we are not called to be comfortable as Christians.  Maybe this is another way of God making me uncomfortable for Him.

 Ah, this is all confusing.  But it does feel better to write about it.  Hopefully I can use my livejournal more frequently this semester.  Judging by how things have been going already, I will probably have to.  

 Anyway, God bless the Crusade!"

"event","I am blogging on my own journal for the first time.  Of course, I have been wanting to do it for a long time, but there's a little problem.  Something about time.  But right now I am waiting to save my final publication design project to a zip disc, and the only zip drive in the entire lab is being used right now.  Sigh.  
 I am really looking forward to blogging my random thoughts, ideas, observations and experiences.  Not that I really expect anyone to read this or be interested in it, but more for me to have opportunity to write out my thoughts.  Some people think best when talking or when being quiet, but I think best when I write.  Or so I think anyway.  Maybe I should write about that ...
 The primary purpose of starting this ""account"" was to keep in touch with my friends from the Crusade for Life walk of this past summer.  Most of my journals will probably be related to that, but now and then I will put up a few things on my own account.
 I guess that's it for now.  It's finals time, and I need to study!"

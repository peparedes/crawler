If you want to have a blast on the way to Portland for warped tour, this is the deal.
My dad said I can drive if those of you who want to come with me help me get money [I mean, like all of us get an even amount of money together] to <u>RENT</u>  a NICE CAR to drive to Portland. I'm talking... 2004-2005 car. NICE NICE car. Any takers willing to help achieve this goal would be GREAT. I think we'd have a blast. My dad will rent it in his name with his FULL COVERAGE insurance, and any other insurance charges will have to be payed for by us also. It would only be about $150 for the entire trip [not counting gas] and i would only have room for 3 other people. So thats roughly $40/person for the car plus about $15/ person for gas. $45 is not that bad to have a really nice car and a freaking fun trip to warped tour.

Anybody who's serious about this, let me know. I'm talking SERIOUS serious. PLEASE. I need to know pretty soon whether this is gonna work or not!  =D

Thanks for reading guys!"

Snow, seriously.
Real snow.
Now makes me realize that there really are beautiful things in this world. I know that may sound stupid, or cliche, but I'm serious. Have you ever just taken the time to look at snow? To look at an individual snowflake and see the beauty in the tiny molecule? You should try it sometime. It may just free you, or captivate you, either one. I could type so much more about snow.. but I'll leave it at this:

Valentines Day is overrated. Its just another greeting card company excuse to print cards and make money. Seriously, have any of you thought about that? This day is ridiculous.
People keep chiming ""Happy Valentines Day"" and all I can think is ""What the fuck is so happy?""
There are millions of people in the world that have no one to spend today with, and there's a select few who have someone.. But why do they need a specific day to show eachother they care? It's ridiculous.

for those of you who dont know, my uncle was arrested on november 10th. 
here is the basis of the police report, for any of you that care.

""<b>DATE / TIME: Nov. 10, 2005 @ 1430 hrs.
CRIME/INCIDENT: Domestic Violence & Assault with a weapon
LOCATION: Cypress Ave., Burney
VICTIM: Confidential
SUSPECT: Kevin Farley, WMA, 41 yrs.</b>

<i>On 11/10/05 at approximately 1430 hrs., a female victim came to the Burney Station reporting she had just been assaulted by Kevin Farley, while at the Cypress Ave. address. While searching the residence for Farley, Deputies were dispatched back to the Burney Station where the responsible had went to the station and threatened the victim while she was standing outside. While roving patrol units searched for Farley who had left the station in a blue Chevrolet S-10, Deputy Koenen returned to collect loaded weapons from the scene. While entering the home on Cypress Ave, Deputy Koenen was confronted by Farley who had snuck back to the house. Farley pointed a rifle at Deputy Koenen, racked his weapon, and fled out the rear of the residence. A joint search was conducted and Farley was located hiding in a home under construction on Kirby Court. Farley was armed with two loaded weapons but was taken into custody and booked into the Shasta County Jail on the above charges.</i>""


So. If I seem down, or hurting, or sad.. This will most likely be why.
If your wondering why I just now posted this, after almost 2 months..
It's because I just watched a video watching him get arrested.
<a href=http://www.burneycalifornia.com/MOVIES/Arrest_CD.mov>click here if you want to watch the video</a>

so for those of you that made it this far.. thank you for reading.
i know this doesnt apply to any of you, but what is a journal for? writing about how you feel, so i am doing just that. also, if you ever hear me talking about my uncle sam, it is the same person. he's been uncle sam my entire life, and he will continue to be my uncle sam. my favorite person in this entire world.

that was all just a weekend long expedition for him,
just to have some fun.

i thought about ty, and what i'm going to do about my feelings.
i'm... i just need to let things happen the way they need to, the way they are supposed to.
he really is thrilling though. i need to be in his presence again.
it gives me a high like no drug ever could.

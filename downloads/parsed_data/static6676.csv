i'm wicked excited to be back!! it was definitely an...adventure...getting here, though, that's for sure! 


so i took the train from toyama to kansai, and it made one stop in osaka where i had to switch trains. when we got to my stop at shin-osaka, i gathered all my luggage and made my way to the door. but i had a decently heavy bag (though not too heavy) and had to scrunch past this very RUDE woman who would not even budge a little to help me past. at any rate, i got to the door, just in time to see that the train was MOVING AGAIN. i feel bad for the poor snack guy--i was panicking a little and rambling to him in broken japanese, trying to understand what was going on and what i should do. he didn't really help me, but he got somebody who told me that i could turn around at the next stop on a connecting train and take the next kansai-airport train. 

let me tell you, at osaka station, i BARELY caught the connector. i mean, it took me a little while to understand where to go, but i managed to get on that damn train just as the doors were closing O_O  i'm really not sure what would have happened if i missed that train, because had i not caught the next kansai train, i may have even missed my flight  (or maybe i would have needed to rush--who knows!)

well, i caught my flight, but i got to the gate with only about a half hour to spare due to crazy slow attendants and a bit of hassle at the gate (i put a bottle of liquid in my carry-on...apparently that's not allowed these days). but then, before ANYONE could enter the plane, we ALL (and i was on a 747 so there were literally about...mmm....a million of us, no exaggerations) had to have ALL of our carry-ons checked by personnel. people were pretty pissed off, but i didn't care too much, since i had that bit of drama on the train, lol

the flight sucked. flights always suck. so i didn't sleep at ALL. when i finally got to the detroit airport, the culture shock hit me a little bit as i was rushed off by barking, cranky, bleach-blonde officials all around me. you know, i just couldn't get over the attitudes of these people. in japan, and basically anywhere, if you don't speak their language, they use english to their greatest extent to help you, and especially in japan, they're super friendly about it. here, there were people trying to get through, and these workers would tell them where to go in english, and if the passenger didn't understand, the person would just say it louder and with more annoyance in their voice. it was SO frustrating to watch this, then to watch them mutter to each other about how sucky their jobs are, after coming from japan, where i was treated in an extremely courteous manner by anyone, be they postal workers, train officials, or mcdonald's cashiers. WHATever.

but now i'm home, and it's really warm and good here! i fell asleep last night at about 7:00 pm, but it's okay. i don't feel nearly as bad as when i arrived in tokyo, so i'm pleased. also, i just turned on spike TV (cable!! yes!!) and there is an ALL DAY star trek voyager special!!! there truly is no better way to start my vacation ^_^





and oh yeah, <i><b> HAPPY BIRTHDAY DANIELLE!!! </i></b>


you are awesome. but you already knew that.

"event","hmmm....haven't updated in awhile...

today is portcon! i'll post dorktastic pictures at some point later this week! AND my graduation party is tomorrow! i planned this weekend a little poorly, which i now realize--having portcon the day before a big party for which my mother is FREAKING OUT....not a good idea. of course, it means i'm out of the house and away from her, so maybe it *is* a smart thing, after all. 

one of my students from camp is also going to be at portcon today. i'm CRAZY amused by this, as he's about to see his teacher walking around all day in a schoolgirl outfit, buying toys and candy. awesome.

i bought the sims complete collection, and i am obsessed with the stupid game. it was only 40 bucks, which is absolutely worth it, since i've already played for many, many hours on end. but let me tell you, this pack is much harder than the first one. you have to actually *talk* to people to get them to like you, not just joke/entertain/joke/entertain until their friends meter is full. also, i learned that in sim life, i'm kinda sleazy. and kinda gay. donovan and michael are jut TOO cute together! you'd never understand, not unless you've seen donovan leap into michael's arms (which, naturally, i have). i don't care what anyone says; they're real people. real people living in my computer, whose every whim is controlled by MMMEEEE (have i mentioned how much i love the sims)

i really, really can't wait to go to japan. i'm not even really nervous at all (yet). i got the final invitation to the mandatory departure meeting and i'm thrilled. it sounds like everything is made so easy, too--when i get to my prefecture, my boss is going to take me around to buy a cell phone, get a bank account, and whatever else i need. AND my predecessor is going to still be there when i'm there (don't ask where i'm staying...i don't quite know yet), and has told me he'll show me around town ^_^

ps. renee has indirectly promised me food anytime i flirt with her. i'll never go hungry again!"

What's creepier is that I sometimes follow her around and she's got mannerisms like you too.

i got some new cartoon crushes (Leon and Link, the sexy elf), as well as some new human ones too (Bam Margera = YES)
and oh yeah, the time spent with my friends and boyfriend was okay, too.

because everybody knows that you can't respond to an entry once there's a newer one up from the same person. DUUUUHH. 


by the way, please disregard that last statement, especially if you feel like drooling over Leon S. Kennedy with me.


pps. i decided that the ""S"" stands for ""sexy"" or possibly ""supafly"" or maybe even ""seeyoulateronthatdateiaskedyouontiffany"""

i am so indescribably pissed that i have to work at being the best at everything. who am i these days? all i know is that i definitely don't like it. 


also, i've been thinking about it, and when i work hard, i feel more like the supervillain than the hero. i wonder what that means..."

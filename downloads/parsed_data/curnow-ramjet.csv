Tennis Presentation night last night. Waste of time. Pretty fun though. Short sentences.

David and I tried to get into the Wilding Centre, but it was locked up tight. I did manage to hit my fingers on the railing of that stairwell, twice. And i'm sure we impressed those Year 8's with our ""You better get inside or we'll tell Mr. Russell."" Oh! And Mr. Foley told me to get a hair cut."

Chuck Norris responded to the Chuck Norris Facts on his official website, chucknorris.com with the following statement:

    I'm aware of the made up declarations about me that have recently begun to appear on the Internet and in emails as ""Chuck Norris facts."" I've seen some of them. Some are funny. Some are pretty far out. Being more a student of the Wild West than the wild world of the Internet, I'm not quite sure what to make of it. It's quite surprising. I do know that boys will be boys, and I neither take offense nor take these things too seriously. Who knows, maybe these made up one-liners will prompt young people to seek out the real facts as found in my recent autobiographical book, 'Against All Odds'? They may even be interested enough to check out my novels set in the Old West, 'The Justice Riders', released this month. I'm very proud of these literary efforts."

"event","Hoorah. Work is over for a while.

First Shift, Thursday 22nd of December.

Started at 7 PM. ""Holy fuck.."" My first thought as i walked in to see the countless people sitting around drinking and laughing. Apparently today was the day when all the workers finish before Christmas so they all went to the Nott for a drink. Wasn't too bad as there were 2 or 3 Bussies (the guys who pick up the glasses and plates etc.) including myself. And my brother was working too which was fun because we have a lot of ""in-jokes"". We get some really funny drunks sometimes. They usually get up and dance to the music the band is playing. They can't dance for shit... thats why its so funny. Well anyway, im doing my rounds outside, and i hear yelling from a table about 10 metres away from me, i look around and a guy in a white jumper throws a glass into some guys face. The glass explodes when it hits the guy. The guy in the white runs away and everyone crowds around the second guy. His head was split open terribly and there was blood all over the table. I don't think i've ever seen that much blood in my life.. well, in person anyway. The ambulance arrived shortly after and took the guy away and the police arrived soon after. Rest of the shift wasn't too bad. But i could never get over that. Then another small fight in the parking lot. Got home around 2:30 AM.

Second Shift, Friday 23rd of December.

Started at 5 PM this time, the usual shift i work. Not as bad as yesterday, still really busy though. But again, 2 or 3 Bussies working. And Matt was there so again, not completely boring. Tonight wasn't as violent as the last, but really rowdy. EVERYONE was drunk. I saw two guys get up and dance into a tree and fall over. Why do drunk people like to hug me? But all was well at the Nott.. except a fight that seemed to be brewing but never happened. But they [drunk people] can be so fucking ignorant. They push each other around all the time. You gotta watch where you are walking or you are likely to have a big, hairy, intoxicated man thrown at you. Finished the shift at 12 AM and went into the Public Bar (I work in the Uni Bar) and hung around with all the other bar staff. That was pretty good. They can't sing though. 

Im leaving for Echuca in the morning and staying up there for a little while.. like 2-3 days, i thought a week, but i was wrong. If you don't know where Echuca is... don't ask me cause i have no idea either. It's in the country. Have fun everyone! Merry Christmas and all that Jazz."

Apparently a green car came out of no where and was hit by a white car, and then the bus that i was on hit the white car. No one was seriously hurt, although i saw an ambulance, but i think thats standard procedure. Apart from that, we held up a lot of traffic.

Oh, i was standing up when it happened too, so i almost fell over. And my bags slid from the back of the bus to about half way.

Half way through telling David my phone ran out of battery :( so sorry to David about that.

So we sat there for about 30 minutes, before we were allowed to move. Kinda boring. Listeded to Wolfmother and Pantera for a bit.

Finally when we did get to move, i got too see the damage. At first it didnt seem so bad, then on the other side of the car, the top righthand wheel had been ripped off and there was alot of metal and glass on the ground.

Hey, maybe i have been in an accident before, i just cant remember because i hit my head or something. What if, all of this isnt real?? What if im still in a coma?? What if im not real?? Oh my god!! I CAN FEEL MYSELF FADING AWAY!!"

I was going to take a picture of it, but by the time i got home, it didn't look that awesome. Oh, and my hair is wet too.

So i was feeling pretty crap all day. I thought i would cheer up on the train, but i was still in a bad mood, so sorry to everyone for that.

But, i have a guitar lesson tonight, maybe my teacher will make me feel better with one of his freakin' awesome solo's. Or maybe he'll draw another smiley face in my book. They look dead because their eyes are crosses. Still cool though. Also, i think i've broken my guitar, and i have to get it looked at/repaired, hopefully tonight. 

I'm really getting worried about exams too. They're so near and i've done very little study. If i fail, my parents say they aren't going to let me go back to St. Kevin's. I can't imagine how humiliating that'll be.

Pantera - Cemetary Gates

Black Sabbath - Fairies Wear Boots
Black Sabbath - Symptoms of the Universe (Man, the lyrics for this song are really odd)
Oh, and a bit of Pennywise

(Stop stealing my ideas Alexius)
Period 1!
English! Continued and finished watching Romeo and Juliet. Wasn't too bad. Still though, using old English in a modern-ish era is really wierd. They also left out a fair bit of the play. 

Period 2!
R.E! As usual, pretty easy, not much work. Funny thing Mr. Hay did, started writing something and trailed off towards the end until the last word was a squiggle. 

Period 3!
Science! I really enjoy science now that we are doing chemistry again. Mr. Davies is an awesome teacher, and a family friend. 

Recess!
Again, i can't remember what happened.. Stole Anton's old ""hang-out"" spot, and hung out. I ate an apple, a Barbeque Shapes Go Pack!, and i think a sour Roll-Up. 

Period 4!
Computer Studies! Again, we have no objective in this class! We are just ripping off some cricket bat website. The banner says ""Hand Crafted Cricket Bats"" and i tried to make it say ""Hand Crafted Pirate Swords"". That was yesterday.

Period 5!
Tutor Group! Biggest waste of time! We sat in the theatre and watched dicks make dicks of them selves. Except Alistair who showed his vast knowledge of France.

Community Service!
Seb got out of it due to aths, bastard*. Went in and surprisingly enough we didnt get attacked. Went on to the ovals and spoke to the kids and the Avila girls. My usual art teacher wasnt there so the class did maths. They were learning fractions. 

Afterwards!
Went to the Glen to buy shoes. Walked around for about half an hour to an hour looking for shoes that would fit my feet. Sadly, i would make a very good clown. Was chased by Corgi, Kat and Margie, until they finally got my attention. I showed them the gaping hole in my shoe :D. Tomorrow im going to rip the sole of it off and walk around all day with just the top part of the shoe on. Then on the train, everyone can sign them.

*Reminds me of a time when i was very young, maybe about 8. I used to do little aths, and was pretty good. Then one day some kids teased and bullied me, and i never went back. I think back to this and say, what little bastards. If they had never done that, today i would be so fit. I wish i could go back in time. Theres so many things i want to fix..."

"event","Today was fun. First three periods of Tuesdays are my favourite. First i have Alistair, Seb and Peter in Literature, then Dean and Raimond in Maths, then Pat and Kevin in Computer Studies!

Period 1!
Literature. Listened to Othello tape whilst reading along to it! Up to the part where Iago gets Cassio drunk and into a fight, leading to his dismissal as Othello's Lieutenant.

Period 2!
Maths. Most of the class was at the Korowa thing, i wasnted invited. We basically did nothing. And Mr. Barrow saw my pocket watch.

Period 3!
Computer Studies. We have absolutely no idea what we are meant to be doing, if anything. We are making websites! Well, we are really just ripping off other sites with the View/Source thing. Fun nonetheless.

Recess!
Wow i cant even remember what happened. Pat got hit with a shoe (or was that lunch?) and i tried to pick a fight with that guy who made fun of Kat, Margie and Corgi on the train. He just made retarded sounds.

Period 4!
Sports Science. I hate this subject so much. Im really going to fail it since i havent really been paying attention in class. Oh, tried to draw Diamons, Hearts, Spades and Clubs on my arms. Screwed up the colours. Got the red ones off but... i drew the black ones on in Copic... very permanent.

Period 5!
Visual COmmunications. Possibly my favourite subject. Was with Pat, no Raimond this time. And no Ms. Doyle so we did no work. Had this wierd plastic with numbers and letters on it and when you scratched them on to a piece of paper they came off, kinda cool. Had FCK put on to my fingers. It really hurt. Like alot. My fingers were swollen after.

Lunch!
Pat got hit with a shoe? And we sat around. Real boring guys.

Period 6!
Saxophone lesson. Im apparently getting better! Well, its about time, i have been playing for nearly 4 years. Hahaha, no David, before you say anything, not 4 years straight.

Period 7!
Science. Was the second period of double science. Was really fun because i came in, all the experiments had been done and i just copied the work. The for the whole period we walked around and did nothing. Mr. Davies rocks.

Afterwards!
To the Glen! Sat in the Sun! Sat in the Shade! Actually Spoke! People actually listened! Was great for me. Alistair left real early. I got home real late! Mum, Dad and Brother werent home! Got to listen to my music real loud!"

"event","Howdy! First entry, Background looking hardcore, Avatar not.

I've started reading Hellsing (manga, a Japanese anime comic for those that dont know) series, pretty awesome so far. Its about an organisation called Hellsing that protect humans from monsters such as Vampires. Lots o' gore, like in the third chapter, a guy has the top of his head ripped off, and then a Vampire drinks the blood.

Today went out with Gen and her friends. Was really fun too. Walked around, not doing much. Went to Melbourne Central. A first for me. Damian and I went to Borders, looked at the anime and manga, saw Hellsing, but it was $30... Got some lunch, talked some more, and walked to Burke Street. Gen and her friends had to leave :( so Damian and i went looking an Anime store he said he though was around there, found it and bought a clock and a bunch of chibi key rings of Full Metal Alchemist. After we went to a freakin awesome comic book store. Found Hellsing for $20, and bought it :D. 

All in all, great day, hope to do it again sometime!"

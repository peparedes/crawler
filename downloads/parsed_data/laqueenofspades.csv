"event","Well, you see, I switched over to Xanga at the beginning of the year and then I realized that Garland folk still use LJ more.  Oh well.  After a grueling first semester, I am back home finally!  Hooray!  I'm still a theatre design major (lighting and stage management) in case you were wondering.  It's strange to be back home, I'm not going to lie.  This life feels so <i>different</i> then my ""usual"" life at school.  I've forgotten things like asking permission before leaving, watching my mouth, and doing whatever I want whenever I need. I still can't get over how early everyone goes to bed around here!  Weird...  This Christmas is looks like it's going to be a low maintanence one.  We just got our tree tonight and the house is only half-decorated. Our annual cookie baking day is tomorrow, so we'll see how that plays out.  

I really miss everyone here and I think it would be fun to have a band seniors 2005 get-together at Chili's sometime thisbreak when people all come home.  Merry Christmas!"

"event","<P>Once again, sorry for the somewhat depressing and cynical last entry. To compensate for that, I'm going to do that Ten Things I'm in Love With or some crap like that... </P>
<OL>
<LI>BUT kids (that would be Baylor University Theater kids) and the program in&nbsp;general.&nbsp; Theater people are just so fun to be around!&nbsp; I really love all of my theater classes.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am being forced to act against my will, even though I'm a designer, but I've&nbsp;secretly decided that I like doing it!&nbsp; Mwaha!&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway,&nbsp;hanging out with the theater kids reminds me a lot of the way the band kids used to be, (it was&nbsp;different in high school theater&nbsp;I think).&nbsp; We go places together a lot to parties...movies...Wal-Mart.&nbsp; And we're always singing show tunes (especially in Wal-Mart).&nbsp; I've gotten the worst at it (not that I like <EM>super </EM>suck, I just turn on the Ipod and practicing singing Broadway style when I'm walking by myself.&nbsp; People look at me strangely...but I don't care because I'm getting better)&nbsp; It's&nbsp;fun.&nbsp;</LI>
<LI>Swing dancing!!&nbsp; Holy crap! This is seriously the best thing EVER!! Today, I was chucked <I>off the ground!!</I> How flipping awesome is that?!&nbsp;&nbsp;That ranks as number one in my book, you know, one of those things you have to do before you can die. Check that one off the list! (:</LI>
<LI>I've got Wicked tickets!!&nbsp; October 15 can't come soon enough!&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>My Ipod mini!&nbsp; She's pink and her name is Sweet Pea.&nbsp; I have like&nbsp;three hundred songs and I jam everywhere that I go, singing as I see fit.&nbsp;&nbsp;She&nbsp;is truly the best college investment I made.&nbsp; If you don't have one, just splurgle and buy one.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are worth every penny.</LI>
<LI>Access to a gym!&nbsp; I love to work out and crap like that.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am definitely losing weight here.&nbsp; I love it!&nbsp; My goal is to become&nbsp;thin enough to get thrown up in the air all the time in swing.&nbsp; I'm on my way....</LI>
<LI>Parties.&nbsp; I'm not going to lie, I like going to parties, drinking, dancing, and having some fun.&nbsp; I'm usually with theater kids&nbsp;though, which is good because if someone over-indulges, one of the upperclassmen takes them to their apartment or just&nbsp;makes sure they are safe.&nbsp; It's a pretty good system, I think.&nbsp;</LI>
<LI>Earrings.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;at least one pair in every color (except orange strangely enough).&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangles are&nbsp;the way to go, man!&nbsp; Since it's so hot here and you have to wear summer style shirts and tenis,&nbsp;I'm not looking as fashionable as&nbsp;I once tried to.&nbsp; But at least I&nbsp;can show some personality with the earrings.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>Hah, there's a place in Garland called Pollo Salsa.&nbsp; They have like eight different types of salsa there.&nbsp; I&nbsp;enjoy&nbsp;eating there, even if it's not<EM> really</EM> real...however traitorous that may be.</LI>
<LI>Tacones...I mean heels.&nbsp; even though I can't wear them very often here.&nbsp; I still really like the elegance and glamour of wearing heels.&nbsp; Oh,&nbsp;and the height helps too.</LI>
<LI>DANCING!!&nbsp; OH YEAH!!&nbsp; 'NUF SAID HERE! (ghetto or otherwise)</LI></OL>
<P>Things are going pretty well for me here.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm pretty happy.&nbsp; I hope college is going well for you as well.&nbsp; Good night all!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>"

"event","Does anyone ever feel like you are constantly the listener?  Do you ever feel like people are more than willing to pour out their hearts to you and listen to the thought-out advice you give them but when you try to show a tiny piece of yourself, they completely shut down?  Do you ever wish someone would listen to you like you always listen to other people?  I always try my hardest to say what needs to be said in the best way possible when someone is looking for an ear and some advice.  It seems like my would-be listeners write me off with a ""that sucks"", an ""aww..."", or my favorite ""I don't know what to tell you.""  Well, thanks for your fabulous help.  

I feel like a prude and a slut at the same time.  I don't make out with randomers or have sex, ergo I'm a prude here.  Yet I do drink and I do get...violated... thus I'm a alcoholic slut by the standards we've been bound to in high school and by our former classmates.  I wonder if I'll ever really fit in.  I usually haven't had problems making and keeping friends.  But lately, I just don't want to make the effort. WEll, I am close with the theater people (they all seem to know my name, but I can't remember half of them.  I think they associate me with being one of the two designers and having huge boobs) It doesn't bother me to go places by myself.  I feel like I'm my own person, I guess.  I also don't mind not having a boyfriend...except that everyone else seems to have one and talk constantly about their relationship.  Boys only like one thing about me...well, two things. I don't really get much attention from the neck up.  But believe me, I am so flattered when I am told that I should be a porn star or that I have the biggest tits they've seen.  Too bad I'm only a double d, and that's the same size as Jessica Simpson and Pamela Anderson.  So ha, I DON'T have the biggest breasts ever. Some people actually tried to start a nickname for me...BOOBS, isn't that creative?  I smiled and reminded them that I wasn't an nanby-pansy actress, but an experienced technician skilled with tools like the electric drill and the crowbar.  We'll see who tries to call me Boobs now... Oh, did I tell you about the one guy who said to me ""I want to know what it's like to fall asleep on your bosom.""  WHO THE HELL SAYS SOMETHING LIKE THAT?!

Alas.

In other news, chances are very slim that I'm going to change my major.  I just don't get that spark from anything else.  It's slightly depressing that I am not good at something that brings home the bacon, but I'm planning on marrying the guy that sits next to me in Psychology who is majoring in forensic science.  No, he doesn't know yet.  In fact, we just formally introduced ourselves today.  (To be fair, we've been whispering back and forth all year, but we never actually said ""Hi, my name is...""  He really sucks at whispering, the professor always knows what we are up to.)  He looks at my face first when he talks to me. Points. 

Wicked is coming to Dallas in October and I have tickets.  I've already told Russell my brilliant scheme, so I guess I'll tell you.  After the show, I'll ask to talk to the lighting technician.  I'm majoring on theater design with a focus on stage management and lighting.  I plan on bombarding him with a slew of intelligent questions, (you know, show him that I am really interested in what he has to say...which in reality I am) and then I'll manipulate him into introducing me to the stage manager.  I figure that if I can pull this off, it would be a good way to start formulating connections with designers for later in the business.  I'm very excited about Wicked the show, though!  I've been listening to the soundtrack nonstop.  If you don't know what Wicked is...just go jump off a bridge (actually you could educate yourself at http://www.wickedonbroadway.com).  

As thrilling as this entry must be to you, I need to get some sleep.  I'll talk to you later, I suppose. Sorry about the somewhat dark tone."

"event","<P>Ok, well...I am aware that most of ya'll have yet to actually go to college...so here's my best and worst look on college and college life... </P>
<P>WORSTS... </P>
<UL>
<LI>No or very little air conditioning in the dorms. Even though you paid a monster of a fee to be allowed to park on-campus, finding parking is bloody impossible. </LI>
<LI>Walking beneath the beating sun to classes WAY across campus in only ten minutes...gross. Everyone is always sweating and sick thanks to the extreme temperature changes. </LI>
<LI>Community showers. Shaving is impossible, just go French. There is no other way! I kept giving it a valient effort, but there's no ledge to put your foot on and there's no friction on the floor wearing shower shoes. I ended up nearly knocking myself unconscious. I wouldn't advise it. </LI>
<LI>No heels, alas! </LI>
<LI>Getting religion shoved down your throat. I swear, sometimes it's enough to make me want to become Buddhist. (just kidding!) Chapel is probably the biggest waste of my life I've ever had INCLUDING calculus. </LI>
<LI>Having to buy all the crap you need by yourself (i.e., using <I>your</I> money.) I'm talking things like more towels, school supplies, crap like that. Grr... </LI>
<LI>Missing your old friends. </LI></UL>
<P>But college isn't all bad! Oh no!! Here we go, the </P>
<P>BESTS: </P>
<UL>
<LI>Design Theater courses! This semester I'm taking Costuming and I'm due to finish a corset before Christmas!! How exciting! </LI>
<LI>No parents, wahoo! </LI>
<LI>People in general are very helpful and easy to talk to. </LI>
<LI>SWING DANCING!!! This was probably the best experience thus far!! I'm also looking forward to fencing club! </LI>
<LI>Getting away from Garland is definitely a plus. But really, it's a sideways move for me... </LI>
<LI>Psychology class is fascinating!! But the only thing that I really get excited about is theater courses, so I really think that's where I'll end up. Interestingly enough, I am the only theater design major in the freshmen class. We'll see what happens with that. </LI>
<LI>New laptop, oh yeah!! Plus, you can buy Microsoft office for like 10 dollars as opposed to buying it for 500 dollars like the rest of the world. That's pretty awesome. </LI>
<LI>College parties! Woo hoo!! Yay frat parties!&nbsp;</LI>
<LI>Fresh start with the boyz...(: </LI>
<LI>Actually getting to use a gym...WITH a rock-climbing wall!! Yesssss!&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
<LI>Meeting all the people thast you've met via Facebook. Ha, this one's always a laugh! </LI></UL>
<P>By and by, the goods overweigh the bads! I am enjoying college (even though I am always tired.) Hope ya'll are having fun too! Back to working on my <lj-cut text=""monologue....""><BR></P>
<DIV><STRONG>Welcome to Hell.</STRONG><BR>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Hello, nice to see you all again. <BR><BR>As the more perceptive of you have probably realized by now - this is hell, and I am the Devil. Good evening. You can call me Toby, if you like. We try and keep things informal down here, as well as infernal. <BR><BR>Now, you're all here for eternity, which I hardly need tell you is a sod of a long time, so you get to know everyone pretty well by the end, but for now I'll have to split you up into groups. <BR><BR>Are there any questions? <BR><BR>No, I'm afraid we don't have any toilets, if you'd read your bible you would have seen that it was damnation without relief. So, I'm afraid if you didn't go before you came then you're not going to enjoy yourself very much, but then, I believe that's the general idea. <BR><BR>Right, let's split you up then. <BR><BR>Can you all hear me? CAN YOU HEAR ME AT THE RACK? <BR><BR>Off we go... <BR><BR>Murderers, over here. Looters and pillagers - over there please, thieves if you could join them, and Estate Agents. <BR><BR>Fornicators, if you could step forward - My God there are a lot of you. Could I split you up into adulterers and the rest? Adulterers if you could just form a line in front of that small guillotine there. <BR><BR>AMERICANS, are you here? I'm sorry about this, apparently God had some fracas with your founding fathers and damned the entire race into perpetuity. He sends particular condolences to the Mormons who He realizes put in a lot of work. <BR><BR>The Iranians, I'm afraid, couldn't be with us - someone's been holding them in purgatory for the last 9 months. <BR><BR>Sodomites, over there against the wall. <BR><BR>Atheists, over here please. You must be feeling a right bunch of charlies. <BR><BR>Christians, ah yes, I'm afraid the Jews were right. <BR><BR>Moonies, maniacs, marite eaters, male models, masochists, mass murderers and masseurs, if you could take a pew at the back - with the Methodists that is. <BR><BR>Now, you're the lot who used to kill whales, is that right? Ah, yes, I must remember - I've got some strips to tear off you bastards later. <BR><BR>Everyone who saw Monty Pythons' ""Life Of Brian"", I'm afraid He can't take a joke after all. <BR><BR>Alright now, one final thing - we're trying to implement some sort of exchange scheme with the God, or Cliff as we know him. Some of you will spend a decade in heaven and we're having some angels down here. Now, I hardly need tell you that you will be expected to behave in an exemplary manner, so, I hope you will do the exact opposite - tear off their wings, use their haloes for frisbee practice, that sort of thing. <BR><BR>Well, I have to go now, but Jezzlebeth here will show you the ropes, chains, and electrodes. <BR><BR>I'll just leave you with a favorite joke of mine - <BR>Knock, knock <BR>Who's there? <BR>Death. <BR>Death wh..........</DIV>

"event","Well y'all, I officially leave for Baylor in two days.  The house is piled with my boxes and my mother cries every time she looks at them or me.  So here I am, ready to leave behind everything I know and everyone who cares about me.  I've only cried twice, once when I was shopping for Beth's birthday present (which is today, BTW), and then when my siblings said they didn't want to miss school to see me off.  I know it's selfish of me to want them to come and potentially get behind in school.  I <i>know</i>.  But I still want them to.  Everyone keeps posting these fantastic pictures they have of them and their friends.  And that made me realize...I don't have any pictures.  Not really.  *Sigh* What a stupid and pointless entry.  

I guess what I really wanted to say is goodbye and good luck to you.  I'll always remember.

Now after that gushy crap...Guess what?  I had to take the TB shot to get into college (you know, the tuberculosis one) and you'll never guess what happened.  It came back positive!  Talk about a panic in the streets!!  So they told me I needed a chest x-ray to make sure it was some sort or error and made an appointment after the weekend. 

So I decided to go on a roadtrip with Beth that weekend!  (I'm trying to make this one not so long) She had to go down to Austin to do a colorguard clinic and I tagged along.  The first night we stayed in this ghetto motel. There was a fruit truck and some fag sleeping next to it so people won't steal fruit. It was so lame!!  And then, some drunken fag chased us in the parking lot!  Creeeeeepy... So we decided to visit the one place that everyone either hates or loves...Sixth Street.  It was fun walking around, talking to the bouncers and crap.  But in the end no one would let us in (damn it, no 17 year olds, Beth!!) We went home after a while only to get up early and go tromp around UT campus to the faggus clinic.  We ate lunch at a pretty nice little Italian place near Sixth Street called The Brick Oven Restaurant.  It was tasty!  We drove to SAn Antonio to go stay with my cousin Sal and promptly got lost.  After we arrived at my cousin's mansion-like house, we play like a million games of pool before deciding that we were hungry.  It was only after we opened the door that we realized it was in a torrential downpour.  But a little rain never hurt anyone before, right?  WRONG!!  I was driving this time and we couldn't see the  road in front of us at all!!  Water was flooding on the streets and the defroster wasn't working so all of the windows were fogging up!  BLAST!!  So we rolled the windows down to let out the steam of the fog and of course got drenched.  But at least we could see, right?  We then hazardeously drove to Las Palapas a few blocks away.  The rest of the night was pretty uneventful.  We watched a few movies and played more games of pool (We couldn't go anywhere else because of the rain).  The next morning we left Sal's and drove to some outlet stores in San Marcos.  After spending way too much time there, we finally drove home.  It was loads of fun, we'll probably take another one near Christmas or something.

I got back home and went to the doctor's.  They took the X-ray and it was negative.  But for some reason, they want me to take some medication against tuberculosis for four to six months. Apparently, I am a high risk because I've been exposed to it before.  The doctor said it might have been in the nursing home.  THANKS NHS!!  There was also a rumor going around that a kid was running around school with active tuberculosis. Leave it to Garland to suck away my life and my health...Anyway, y'all should all get this shot just in case.

I had just been informed by my roommates that our color scheme will be hot pink and lime green.  *sigh* What a year this will be...

I'm out!"

"event","My major is Theatrical Design with an emphasis on stage management.  You know, I've been doing a lot of soul-searching lately.  After freshman orientation, where we chose classes, I started to feel iffy.  Who wouldn't after those countless years of IB/Enriched Honors/Elementary School Special Placement classes that always stressed college preparation and hard work yadayada...then finally going to college to take no real classes? I'm taking Psychology, Junior-level Spanish, and the rest is theatre stuff!!  No math, no science, no history, <i>no English!!!</i>  I'm paying God-knows-how-much money to go to school at Baylor and for what?  For a degree on the proper way to hammer and work sound equipment?  I love working with theatre, but is it where I should be?  I feel like I'm slacking off, that I could do something great with my life, but I just don't know where I belong.  People tell me to do what I enjoy doing or that I can be whatever I want to be.  What if you enjoy doing lots of things and you don't know what you want to be?  What the hell are you supposed to do then, eh?  My strengths are leadership, Spanish, and English, all of which can be applied anywhere.  GREAAAAT. More good news.  

I hate not having a clear goal.  I can't handle not doing something with my life.  I'm terrified that I'll become a faggot bum who hasn't a clue...or a permanant housewife.   

Has all my hard work in school all these years been all for naught? Maybe we'll find out.

"event","Well, obviously, the most important thing that's happened to me is the release of the sixth Harry Potter book (and no, I don't care if you call me a nerd.  I started the first one in, like sixth grade. I've grown up with these kids...well, slightly faster).  New Harry Potter record for me, I finished the book in five and a half hours. (:  (Order of the Phoenix took me six, Goblet of Fire took me seven)  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and can contribute my two cents if anyone wants to discuss.  

Sara threw a Harry Potter Murder Mystery that I got to help out with.  It was different from the one I threw about a month ago mostly because we had to do everything from scratch (relying mostly on how I remembered/figured things went together.)  We finished the clues at last on Tuesday, but then when two girls cancelled on Friday and another guy wanted to come, we had to rewrite a lot of our work and add a character an hour before the party.  So that's why some things we wrote in were super lame, LOL.  It was a lot of fun and I'm hoping that someone else I know will throw one :-D  

In other good news, we have finally managed to get rid of that faggot dog.  You see, my dad was out walking and he saw our dog strolling about the neighborhood.  Of course he called and of course she didn't come.  All of a sudden, that fag (the dog, not my Dad) sprints over to by a neighbor's fence and starts attacking...something.  Apparently she kept biting and shaking her head violently with...whatever it was...tightly clenched between her jaw.  She then procceeded at take the carcass and lay it on our neighbor's lawn and CRUNCH into it.  HOW F-ING SICK IS THAT?!  At this point, my dad thought it was a small dog (and was probably also thinking damn, we're going to have to a law suit on our hands).  Luckily it wasn't a dog, but....an armadillo.  Well, after it's tasted blood, you can't have that dog around your family, so we finally took the monster to the pound once and for all.  Fortunately for the beast, as soon as we walked in, like three different people started showing interest in adopting her.  Haha, fools....

I'm going to go find some food.  Toodles, ya'll!"

"event","WEll, hopefully it's not really the plague.  It's probably just allergy related (I am hacking like a seal,my throat is aflame, and my head is pounding). So needless to say, I declined the opportunity to pass my germs to our customers and stayed home from work today. I feel so useless today...I sat and watched Family Guy reruns over and over...and over. 

My flamenco teacher gave me a real flamenco fan from Spain yesterday.  It's a royal blue and fairly large.  I love it! I also found out we're going to have a castanet workshop in July, woo!

All this coughing is making me feel exhausted.  It's like someone is half strangling me or attempting to drown me 100% of the time.

(: Blast, if only I had been the murderer, the night would have been so much better...I'm probably going to have another one right before we all split for college, only less elaborate.  No chef and sibling-slaves to wait upon us, I'm afraid.  Hopefully next time, we can cast guys as guys and cut out the lesbianism...coughcoughMICHELLEANDNASHANNA! And maybe Michelle won't break my house next time!! (LOL, j/k!) THanks for those that came, you made it AWESOME! (sorry the prize was so lame, I thought it was money to a theater that people actually went to.  I guess that after spending ""so much"" on everything else, the prize was an afterthought, :-D)
 
I just found out that I'm gonna have FOUR roomies in August...and no sink.  Oy, it'll be interesting, that's for sure. All of them have emailed me and they SEEM nice, but we'll see...By the way, have you FACEBOOK-ED? Only a handful of 2005 kids are on there, so why aren't you, eh? http://www.facebook.com

*Sigh* My summer seems a lot like my school days were- jam-packed. I'm still milking all the hours I can from the bakery before they finally just put their foot down. I think I might apply for a job as a cocktail waitress at Dave and Busters.  That wouldn't be so bad. 

Flamenco tomorrow night from 7-9.  Anyone want to take lessons with me?  It's SO much fun!

"event","...is hopefully on a pause.  Work today was a little strange.  The thing is that the chef and head honcho is a penny-pincher and he is the one that wants to just cut me loose.  But the manager and second in command is insisting that the bakery needs an extra employee because it gets very busy.  So they aren't sure what they are going to do with me.  It's basically a come tomorrow, but don't be so sure about the next day kind of thing. I invented a panini today and hereby dubbed it the 'NiNi. It has turkey, provolone, bacon, guacamole, green olives, tomatoes, lettuce, all smothered in a light pesto sauce.  You have no idea what a haus of a sandwich this is!  It was funny because I was just making myself lunch and casually mentioned it to a customer.  By the end of the day, I had sold six of them plus I convinced a guy to buy overpriced carrot cake($3.99 a slice, yikes). Good day today. (:

Still on my quest to find a Spanish fan, I was sent to a little thrift store by my work called something lame like ""the Treasure Box.""  Well, as gay as the title sounds, it's actually a thrift store specializing in costume clothes and accessories.  It a bit like stepping into the Hollywood wardrope master headquarters.  They had stuff to dress like a westerner, a can-can girl, a flapper, a medieval queen, a flambuoyant hippie, almost anything! It's pretty awesome for theatrical hard-to-finds and I'll give you more information if you want it OR STILL NEED A COSTUME *COUGHCOUGH*. I think I've found my fan...:-D

I watched a lot of TV today (big step for me). A few episodes of Family Guy on DVD AND the MTV movie awards.  Napoleon Dynamite took most of the awards, the sadness...

You know what's frustating yet funny? I'm at work, struggling to speak and understand the Spanish (it doesn't help that I can't hear worth a piece of crap and they think that I don't understand something when I DO, I just am deaf...argh), and they see that I'm floundering and they deliberately speak faster!  And then they let me know at the end that they speak English and were just enjoying watching me suffering...dang you, evil Mexicanos!!

I'm OUT!"

"event","Remember those Choose Your Own Adventure books that used to be popular in the early nineties?  The ones where you make a decision and turn to some page and if you accidently kill yourself, you have to start over at square one?  Well, sometimes it feels like that's the story of my life.  

The bakery's deal with the country club fell through for at least another month.  You see, all this week I'd been training in the actual bakery so I could run the other cafe easily.  Well, now this week has been useless.  This means that if I want any money, I have to get up at 6:30 and work a few hours here and there.  So I'm back to looking for a job...again. I suppose I have to re-try talking to Medieval Times. Nothing but bad experiences there.  I have tried in the past to call the guy that's supposed to be hiring and he is never there and never returns calls.  Finally, one day I got his secretary and he told me to drive up there to talk to him.  So I drive up and am told that not only is he not there that day, but he is taking a week and a half long vacation.  GREAT. The worst/best part is that apparently, they hire almost anyone, but you have to have an interview first.  So IF I can get a hold of him, I can probably have a job.  Oye...

Does anyone know of anywhere else that is hiring?

**EDITED** Thanks to a ""delightful"" band graduate lunch at Chili's FOR FREE, I'm feeling pretty dapper. BLAST they don't have 'dapper' in the choices for mood on this livejournal...I'll just have to make one up...

"event","Well, let me tell you a story about why I hate Mondays.  I was due to start working Monday morning at eight, so I arrive at the bakery at ten till.  Then I am promptly told that I'm not allowed to wear heels and that I had to go home (which takes about 30 minutes and a nice bit of gas) and change shoes. Work wasn't too bad.  My boss for some reason thinks my name is Chelsea.  Well, anyway, I learned how to use the register, despite all odds...these people a) don't know how to spell and b) don't know how to categorize (for instance, they put grande burrito under the sandwich category instead of the taco category in the computer).  Anyway, I got off at 2 and had to go to Sandy's Dancewear to attempt to find something to wear to my lesson that night.  That was pretty uneventful, until I tried to go home.  As soon as I attempt to enter the ramp to get on 635 a large, wood-carrying truck speeds ahead of me and changes lanes to the left.  As I get on, I see blocks of wood that are about the same size as bricks fly off the truck.  Just as I was congratulating myself on not switching lanes in time to get hit, I heard the ominous thunk.  Yeah, what are the odds?  I pulled over with the faggo truck on the side of the highway and both us look at my car. Neither of us saw it at the time, but I made him give me his information anyway, just in case.  Good thing, too.  The piece of wood hit the lower part of the driver's door and dinged the hell out of it.  *Sigh* So I go home and my mom tells me not to call the company yet, because she doesn't know if our insurance will cover it.  Can you believe it?!  TWO accidents in which I had no control over the circumstances!  Anyway, I leave to go to class which was due to start at 6:30.  Well, my dad told me to leave really early (5:30) because ""it would take forever to get there."" I arrived at 6.  Apparently, the place where it was being held is a private studio in the back of someone's house and I was supposed to just go around back and not knock on the door.  Because I am already there, I go to scope it out...but the gate was locked.  So I decide to see if I'm supposed to get to it from the alleyway.  This was probably the biggest mistake of life.  This alleyway had no driveways (except one) and it was about the width of a car and no more.  In addition, no one ever tended to it and there was a huge crack with weeds growing three feet tall coming out of it.  For some God-forsaken reason, I went down this road, the weeds mashing into the bottom of my car, looking in vain for how to get to the studio.  I realized not only that there was no alley entrance, but also that I couldn't continue out of the alley thanks to cratering cement.  I was in the middle by now and I tried going out the only way possible...in reverse.  How I wish I had a automatic right then.  I have to still revv the engine like a fag to back out and I was about three inches from the fence on both sides.  Thankfully, I get to the ONLY driveway and pull in to try to turn around.  It was then I learned WHY there were no diveways.  It was impossible to get in and turn around without smashing into something.  I made a three-hundred point turn trying to maneuver the car mere inches at a time.  I was taking so long and making so much noise that the owners of the house started peering at me from tehind the screened door.  Then a lady that lived there arrived and was trying to drive her suburban in the driveway.  She pulled up for me so I could attempt to get out.  You see, in addition to having a fence to smash into, there was also a rather large telephone pole to my right, clipping me off. I become so frustrated, I parked the car, walked over to the lady in the suburban, and gave her my keys.  Yes, I handed the keys to my 'stang over to a complete stranger.  It was horrible, I danced around on the outside of the car putting my hands over the pole so the car would hit my hands before the pole and my body between the hood and the fence. (In retrospect, this was probably not too bright). It took us thirty minutes to get out of the alleyway.  Needless to say I was shaken and VERY stressed.  So I re-park in front of this house and find that no one is there yet.  No one would answer the door and my cell phone was a bleep away from death. So I sat on the stoop of the house and called my dad to see if he would figure out this mess by phone.  A little later, he calls me back and tells me that it starts at 7.  I went to a gas station for thirty minutes and got an Icee that I didn't get to drink because I had no more time.  So I fo to class and everything is wonderful until halfway through...my damn heel breaks.  ARGH!!  So I had to do all of that stomping BAREFOOTED (and I didn't even just mark it, it was full out).  I got home and my mom yells at me for not doing the dishes.  So that is why Mondays should just die.

Today was brighter.  Work was extremely busy and the damn cash register has the wrong prices for things sometimes that no one bothers to tell me about.  My Spanish is really halting when I'm talking to people that speak fluently, so I'm sure I sound like a moron half the time.  But practice makes perfect, right? I went back to Sandy's and invested in some new shoes (which are a better fit anyway).  I'm slowly but surely tidying up things (yesssss!).  I also wasted some time watching Spider Man 2.  I LOVE that movie...even more than the first! But that fun was cut short because then I heard the news...

We have a hive of Africanized honey bees living on the side of our house.  These (killer) bees are the type that swarm and sting you until you die, going mostly for your eyes and your face.  I don't even have to exaggerate.  We called a bee-keeper dude and he tells us that their hive has about three thousand bees and he'll charge three hundred dollars to exterminate them for us. To be truthful, I didn't believe it.  I thought my family was making a big deal over nothing (like them with my curfew) and this fag just wanted to steal our money.  But then I opened the door to go outside to laugh at my family's lameness and instantly five bees whirled into my face. So I shut the door and sat down at my kitchen table.  And then I heard it as we attempted to eat dinner...Buzzing.  It resonated all the way down the house, thousands of bloodthristy wings beating... AHHH!!  It was the creepiest thing you've ever heard.  But I'll tell you what was worse.  Sometimes, the entire hive would just stop buzzing all at once and there was nothing but silence.  Then, just as randomly, they would all start up again.  It was like they were plotting how to kill us all.  So, three hundred dollars is looking like a paltry sum to pay in exchange for OUR LIVES. So when you come over, DON'T ask me to see our pet killer bees.  We're safe inside and in the front yard.  If you persist in asking me, I'll push you into the backyard and lock the door. Then we'll have your body as evidence for the next idiot that asks...

I'm gonna go take shelter in my room. Cheers!"

"event","So Grant, I have some news.  I NOW HAVE A JOB (and it's not being a coffee bitch).  But I haven't started yet.  More on that later.  The restaurant is called La Parisian Bakery, but I'm not actually working there.  They are opening like an indoor snack shop type place at some field or something like that. I don't actually know.  At first I was a little bummed about working there.  I mean, it's no Chili's.  But I will be required to use Spanish, so that will improve my fluency before CLEP testing and, because it's such a small estabishment, the owners and managers are looking to me to actually run everything at the other location.  So I'm working on functional design, market research, and the cash register...which is basically a beginner entrepreneur job.  I'll let you know how it goes when it actually starts.

In other news, I have been shopping like whoa with the little graduation money I was given.  It's not enough for anything more useful then a good pair of tacones so I bought some really cute heels in turquoise (because that's this summer's hottest color, of course! :D ).  Man, I love to shop.  Good thing I'll be starting to work.  You know, I can't believe I went so long without REALLY wearing heels, I can't stop wearing them now.  Go figure.  

I saw Cinderella Man yesterday.  Excellent movie, I love Russell Crowe.  Go see it, it's probably going to win several awards.  

Tonight I went to go watch the Conte de Loyo Flamenco Theatre perform at a Spanish restaurant called De Tapas.  Tapa means appetizer, FYI, and this restaurant served nothing but tapas. As cool as this sounds, this was the biggest disappointmemt ever.  They considered a tapa anything they could fit on a small plate and it was really lame.  They gave us three slices of cheese and called it a tapa.  They also gave us toasted bread with a ""tomato sauce"" AKA mashed tomatoes on top and called it a tapa.  They gave us five grilled shrimp...voila, a tapa!  It was like Oliver Twist style ""Please sir, can I have some more?""  So lame.  Don't order tapas, it's like eating leftovers.

Many years ago, when I was just a little youngin' (freshmen year), I used to be a part of the flamenco theatre.  But you know me, I was juggling too much with school to be able to handle everything, so I had to drop out.  It was argubly the hardest decision of my high school life.  So tonight my dad takes me for a little treat to go see them...why would he do that to himself and his checkbook?  To make a long story short, I'm now taking classes again and am so excited about it, I think I might die! I still remember mostly everything I learned already (I think).  We'll see!! First lesson is tomorrow!  Yaaaaaay!"

Well, I think that one's pinned me.  That' interesting because I always thought that I was too stupid to be in Ravenclaw.  I always assumed that I'd be in Gryffindor.  *Sigh*, it seems people are confused about my ""inner self"", I have been chosen for every House except Hufflepuff (thank God!)... I still think I belong in Gryffindor! (:  45 days, people....

You know what I ponder every day?  Why, oh why, can I not be as cool as HIM:

""Aww, just look at him...so cute in his wee lil' boots...I mean how many cats can wear boots?""

He's got boots and a sexy voice, what else is there? (:  

""ShelRod"" out!"

It's finally done.

Yay!

Since you were all there, there is no point in rehashing the finer points.  I will say that the speeches were great and I felt like Lindsey, Russell, and Angeline did a wonderful job summing up all the years that I've known ya'll, even you underclassmen.  I was teetering on tears when Angeline spoke, but in retrospect, I don't even remember what she said.  Fantastic job. *sigh* I'm going to miss ya'll.

ANYWAY!

So my family lives mostly in San Antonio and Mexico.  I have one other family that lives this far into the country and they live in Mesquite, also isolated (but not from us).  Basically that means that San Antonio is my home, almost more so than Garland because I'm there so often. Anyway, it just so happens that things came up for every relative that would have thought about coming this far up and so none of them could come.  Don't get me wrong, all of them had legitimate things going on, they weren't being <i>spiteful</i>, it just kind of happened.  Then it turns out my uncle that lives here was going to Honduras on a Doctors Without Borders mission trip, so he had to miss it and his son (my eldest cousin) graduated from Duke last year and is living in Detriot, so he couldn't make it either.  So out of quite a large family, all I had, other than my house family, was an aunt and two cousins. Needless to say, it was a little depressing when people were excitedly chattering about the numbers of tickets they needed and they amounts of family flying in from OTHER STATES (or countries). So there's the prep for this story:

After the graduation, we went to the Gaylord Hotel to eat.  I had never been there, so it was quite a shock when I walked into it.  Inside the hotel, was a perfect replica of the Riverwalk in San Antonio.  There was the river, of course, blue and with fish, there were flowers, plants, and trees everywhere on the Paseo.  The bridges, buildings, and floor all had the same architectual style that the real Riverwalk has and the ceiling is so far above your head, you forget that you are inside a hotel and not in the heart of San Antonio.  My mother turned to me and said, ""If San Antonio can't come to you, we'll go to San Antonio.""  We sat down to eat at a little cafe and were entertained by a street magician (who we decided was <i>del Diablo</i> when we couldn't figure out his tricks).  Then the mariachis came over and sang my favorite song, Malaguena Salerosa, to me. My dad turned to my and said, ""May I have this dance?"" So we stood up in the middle of the ""outdoor cafe"" and I danced with my dad (it's a ballad, by the way). Then I felt a tap on my shoulder and my brother cuts in on my dad.  When the song finished, my dad requested some other song, a fast one this time, and when they played it, he did that little hahaaaaeee thing that Mexicans are famous for.  It was funny because one of the restaurant managers walked by and gave the mariachis a death stare and the bass guitarist goes IT WAS HIM!! and pointed to my dad.  HAHAHAHAHA!!!

After that I came home and went party hopping with Marissa for the rest of the night!  It was awesome!! Ask me about what happened with the strange and ominous-looking stain that I discovered in my front seat if you want to hear a story.  I don't really want to type the story, so just ask. I'm going to go get ready for another party, I hope you and I can get together soon!"

"event","You know how we always make fun of those fags that like to rev their engines and peel out of the parking lot?  Yeah, well I'm having fag problems with HM, aka Hott Mama.  You see, if I try to drive her like any other standard, she has violent spasms in first and second gear. So the obvious answer is to give her more gas.  Suddenly, the only way I can get places is peeling out like a homie and squealing the tires. HOW LAME!  (For you car people, I have to get the engine up to 5000 RPM in first gear before it stops quaking).  Not only that, but as I put my key in the doorlock to get in, THE ENTIRE DAMN LOCK POPS OUT OF THE CAR.  What are you supposed to do about that?!  So as I'm looking for some Super Glue, my dad calls and I tell him the situation.  So we go driving around town attempting to fix this car.  They managed to fix the lock (Good news!) and then we go to some auto place to get the clutch examined. These ""mechanics"" didn't know anything.  After they test drove it, they were like, ""Yeah, you aren't driving this hard enough.  The clutch is just glazed over.  So I revved the engine in second gear to clean it off.(wtf?!)  Try it now.""  Yeah we tried and there was no difference so we left.  On the way home, my dad turned to me and said...

Dad: You know, I bet your car just wants more gas.
Me: *rolls eyes* Oh really?
Dad: I bet she's singing a song for more gas.  <i>Me encanta la gasolina! Dame mas gasolina...!</i>

HAHAHAHA!!

We figure the clutch needs to be replaced or something.  So if you see me cruising along, revving like a fag, it's not because I think I'm cool...it's because my car is obnoxious.


Suddenly it's the new trend to put this thing in the Live Journal.  I've filled out like a million of them, so I might as well continue it and fulfill number 8.

01. Reply with your name and I will write something I like about you.
02. I will then tell what song/movie/icon reminds me of you.
03. If I were to apply an o'clock to you, I will tell you what it would be.
04. I will try to name a single word that best describes you.
05. I will tell you the most memorable moment I've had with you.
06. I will tell you what animal you remind me of.
07. I will then tell you something that I've always wondered about you.
08. Stick this in your LJ so it wil never die!!"

"event","So I figured that now that school is out, people would update their livejournals more often.  Wrongo, I guess.  It seems that people don't have anything to say or that they are being deliciously lazy for the first time in their high school lives (aah, guilty as charged). As for me, I havent really done much.  I went to Scarborough Faire on Sunday, though.  It really is pretty much like stepping back into ""back in the day"" except for all the people not in costume or speaking with an accent.  You know, I wake up every morning pondering why I do not own a medieval costume.  I guess I'll just have to SEW ONE UP.  And where shall I where my creation, you ask?  Well, the first day of term next year, that's when! I bougtr this amazing lip balm and an ostrich feather to replace my quill that my faggus cat gnawed on.  Needless to say, he is not allowed anywhere near my new, fantastic quill.

It sems that I am degenerating into a vegetative state.  The only thing that I HAVE to do is take my little sister to school every morning at 8am, which sucks, but what can you do?  I actually have started playing an 'old"" video game on the PS2...Kingdom Hearts.  I never got around to beating the game the last time I tried (saved after beating Maleficent for the first time) and to my dismay, I discovered that beating the game is pitifully easy...I did it on one life after not playing in a year *sigh*.  So to make things more interesting, I restarted the game to play WITHOUT the help of the cheating magazine.  After two days of solid playing, I am cruising around in Halloween Town, for those familiar with the game.  Fun stuff.

Something that I'd never done before and that I have started doing now out of sheer boredom is looking at shoes on eBay.  i know, who DOES that?!  But some of the shoes are pretty dang cute and most of them have never been worn. Check out this one: 

<img src=""http://i5.ebayimg.com/01/i/03/a0/4e/61_2.JPG"">

Well, I think it's cool-looking.  

I'm going to break the monotony of my life and go shopping for a graduation dress.  See you kiddos later!

**Hooray for HP6!!  It's coming out soon! I reread HP5 for the umpteeth time last night and I'm re-excited!!**"

"event","So yesterday, we went to go pick up my ""new"" car.  My dad told me it is exactly like my other car, more or less, that it is a 'stang, that it is manuel, and that it is a ""shade of red, AKA burgundy.""  We go to pick it up, and I discover, hooray, that is is not burgundy, but a rich, glittery red (think Dorothy's shoes). It's got a black interior, a sub somewhere?, upgraded speakers, deeper cupholders, and Cruise Control.  Her nickname is HM, which stands for Hott Mama! I love it!!

Speaking of burgundy, for reasons unknown, I decided that I need to temporarily dye my hair some fun color...like ""cherry cola"", aka bright burgundy.  So I buy the crap and go home eagerly.  Well, I've never home-dyed my hair, so I didn't have any gloves or protective cream.  So I shrugged, used Vasoline, and scoffed at the glove idea.  Holy crap, what a mess!! For those ofyou who have the fortune of not knowing, dying is a messy, messy endeavor.  The reason for the cream is to protect your skin from being dyed.  From the moment I squirted that crap on my bare hand and saw the sanguine color, I knew I was screwed.  The crap went everywhere and left snakes of red everywhere.  It was bad.  So after A while, I get in the shower to wash off the excess dye.  You know when you first get into the shower, how you close your eyes and raise your head up to the deliciously warm water?  Well, when I has finished that moment, I looked down and instantly felt like that chic off of Psycho (or that ""princess"" from Thirteen Ghosts).  It seriously was like I had been stabbed in some sort of bloody war!!  Not only did it make a complete and utter mess all over the bathroom/tub, but when I stepped out and started to towel my hair off I noticed that there was ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE!!  Oh wait, my hands were stained a deep red, plus there were random splotches of dye everywhere. I later discovered that my hair DID color, only it was the blonde hairs from sophomore year that were colored a light pink.  GREAT!!  But unfortunately, it made my hair kind of greasy?  So I washed it again and most of the pink was gone. And my hair stayed greasy.  So I tried again. AND IT WAS STILL GREASY!!  I guess it was that crap. Boo.  So what a waste of an experience!

So I go to ITS with red hands, which was appropiate for the theme ""Favorite Villain""...because thiefs are evil and I ""was caught red-handed."" Ha.  I actually attended as The FAiry Godmother from Shrek 2 because she is a haus.  It worked out well.  I got an award actually!  I was pretty excited.  They listed some of the crap that I've done and it made me blush...oy.  The seniors also got our cords, hooray!  We had to do senior will, and I was caught compltely unawares (well, I had forgotten, actually).  So i just winged it.  Eh.  Bt we were all pretty sure that Schubert was drunk on tequila last night...God, that woman is nuts!  But hey, whatever.  I thought I won't be too upset, considering that I'd only known these kids ""closely"" for a year.  But I think it was more of the feeling ""where the hell have I been?"" that got me.  We had this little faggot dance afterward and they played my request for the Thong Song, heck yeah! David made me dance with him (not to that one), that was interesting.  And watching Russell dance is always interesting.  Nashanna was there too, looking pretty damn hott in her Spy Versus Spy outfit. All in all, it was loads of fun.

On another note, I saw Star Wars III today.  I won't say anything, except that it was well-made and easily makes up for the last two (that I still liked, just not as much).

See you kiddos later!"

"event","Yeah, the song game is going swimmingly.  Hooray for those participating! (: On to other news...I had to go see a play today at the Pocket Sandwich Theatre (I still have to go see 3 more for PAE, so if you have any cheap suggestions, let me know!) So my brother didn't want to go, so my dad was like I'll go with you.  I'm not going to lie, I was like OKAY!! very fast because parents have seemingly unlimited money and I am *very* limited in the funds department.  So we go to see this strange play called <i>Babes From Outer Space</i>.  Basically, it was three astronauts get shipwrecked on ""Venus,"" where supposedly only women live (think Amazonian women).  Well, what made it the best play I've ever seen was the fact that the audience is encouraged to chunk popcorn and yell at the players in accordance to musical cues.  Well, the audience decided to screw musical cues and threw popcorn throughout the entire play.  It was like it was raining popcorn on stage at all times.  And people made a game of trying to chunk the popcorn down the actresses' blouses.  The best part was the actors didn't respond at all!!  They stood there, looking confused or indignant, and held that expression even as popcorn was sailing into their hair...it was so great!!  My dad and I were seated in the third row (out of four rows) and we made a game of trying to throw the popcorn to hit the stage.  We missed and mainly just hit everyone in the second row with a few lucky hits on the first row. Yessss!  It was so funny, people took their entire buckets of popcorn and dumped the whole thing on people they didn't even know (and there wasn't even that much alcohol involved!)Don't worry too much, beloved readers, the popcorn tasted horrible because there was no salt, butter, or taste...it was popped for the sole purpose of being our ammo. Excellent!

Afterwards, we went to a restaurant called The Egyptian Restaurant to get some Egyptian Pizza.  Well, even though the name of the restaurant was The Egyptian Restaurant, they served Italian food.  (Apparantly it used to be Egyptian food, but then a bunch of Italians took over and never changed the sign, ha!) It was probably the best pizza ever made.  And then our waiter comes over and asks us if we had ever been there before.  We said no and he tells us he's seen us before.  We thought he was kidding, but he told us he lived on Northwest Highway and Oates and asked if we shopped at the Albertson's on Broadway, so I guess he was serious.  On the way, a customer passed us on the way out and randomly asked us if we've been there before, then recommended the spaghetti.  I mentioned this incident in passing while chatting with our waiter and he leaves to come back with a full plate of spaghetti ""as a sample."" HOLY MOLY THAT SPAGHETTI WAS THE BEST EVER! We abandoned our pizza (which was incredible) to attempt to shovel pasta down our throats.  And then for some reason, even though we were fixing to pop, my dad orders a dessert.  This is pretty huge deal, we never get desserts at restaurants unless it's someone's birthday (deemed a waste of money), so I was excited. Unfortunately, we both only managed to choke down a few bites of the tiramasu before giving up.  We sang along to Evil Ways on the radio at the restaurant. Yay for Father Daughter Nights!

On a completely different note, I fully intend to park in my PAID FOR spot tomorrow.  The people without paid for spots can park four blocks away at Kroger.

Two days left...(:"

"event","Ok, so yesterday, I get home and fall asleep at 4.  I wake up at 9 and think to myself, ""Oh, I need to make some enchiladas for English.""  On that note, I go to Fiesta and buy a bunch of crap to make Monterrey enchiladas.  So I boil the Ancho chiles, puree 'em, season 'em, and work desperately to make a pureed pile of crap into a sauce.  Finally, I succeed, so I go on to making the actual enchiladas...deep frying tortillas in a hell of a lot of oil to soften them and then rolling them with ""Queso Fresco"" right out of the pan.  They looked right in the end.  I made two crucial mistakes:

1) I didn't make enough sauce
2) I tried one smothered in sauce RIGHT OUT OF THE PAN.  (I forgot to take microwaving them into consideration)

So I pretty much spent many tedious hours for something that TASTED LIKE SHIT.  (too dry and too bitter cold)

Oh well, I guess.

Spanish IB test was pretty easy. I took it completely cold from about two weeks ago and I might have actually scored a 7.  I did the first choice for my writing sample, and I pretty much wrote it exactly the way I would have done it in English, complete with literary devices, random figures of speech, and humor.  IB TESTS ARE FINALLY OVER YAY!!! (and I <i>do</i> get my cords for SNHS.  <i>That's</i> amazing...)

Skipping a little forward for lack of a better place to put this, I have officially marked Dairy Queen under the Avoid At All Costs List.  We go as a family, (my choice and I chose it only for the Moolatte thingies) and I order my Mocha Moolatte and some food or whatever.  So them my brother goes and he orders a Moolatte too.  And my parents are like lalala...whatever.  If you remember a few entries ago, I mentioned that I wasn't ""allowed"" to drink coffee until 16 days ago.  So I casually mention the consistancy of DOUBLE STANDARDS in the household and that whenever I ""come of age"" to do something, it's pretty much ok for anyone to do it, (i.e., watch rated R movies).  They get mad at me, then get mad at Rudy Alan (when really they should be getting mad at themselves) and tell the people at the window to change one of the Moolattes to be without coffee.  It was the biggest fiasco ever.  They managed to forget an entire order, screw up EVERY drink we ordered, cook the steak fingers until not even my dad could choke them down AND try to poison me with onions in the burger.  (I have this weird gagging reflex when onions are involved (except in salsa for some strange reason).  I seriously can feel my stomach flipping in anguish at the mere smell of one.  What kind of an egotistical condiment is an onion anyway? It pollutes everything around it with it's taste and smell! Gross! Anyway in this burger, they tried to hide these little onion-y devils deep into the bun so everyone thought I was crazy when I told them there were onions in my burger. IT's sneaky and underhanded.)  Seriously, you work in a DRIVE THRU.  Can you get at least ONE order right?  God.  

I went to the DPS to renew my drivers license finally (it expired April 27).  Honestly, that place is equivalent to hell if not lower.  My dad broke the news to me yesterday.  My car is considered ""totaled out"".  That means the cost to fix it is more than it's worth.  We paid 6000 for it and we're going to get 6750 for it.  But I'm still really upset about the entire situation.  I know that we're actually gaining money by this fag guy smashing into me, but I'm really attached to my car.  It is my first car, and it seems like <i>the</i> car for me- red, sporty, manuel.  Oh and now MASHED.  If we kept her, the insurance company would give us 3000 and it would cost 4500 to fix her. The body shop guy said that after 100,000 miles, 'stangs start to screw up anyway so it's a ""blessing in disguise""  I'm really depressed about this.  I think it's just the timing.  I mean, I'm going to have to give it up on Tuesday.  Yes, THIS Tuesday.  And it's starting to really hit me that I won't be seeing ya'll again for a while, if at all.  Most of these kids I've grown up with, a few since elementary school, most since Austin.  I feel so rushed- it seems so important to get everyone's signature in my yearbook because it's the only thing I'll have left and I don't feel like I have enough time with it. I really love the yearbook this year, it's easily the best.  I just wish we could have gotten it sooner.  It seems like I waited forever to get to know people, and now that I am actually starting to ""fit in,"" we're all splitting up.  Tonight was the last band concert.  I didn't shed a tear.  But I left quickly so I wouldn't have people hugging me and telling me they'll miss me.  

Oh God, I'm crying like the biggest fag alive.

I hate tears.  I have attempted to refuse to acknowledge that I have tear ducts. That didn't work out so well.

In English, Bissett went around and told everyone what she thought about them.  She said that I set extremely high standards for myself and expect others to as well.  She said that I lead by example and that this is supposed to be an asset or something.  And Ai also said that she thought I was easy to talk to with a funny, sacarstic sense of humor (and that I had cute earrings all the time).  And yet, instead of feeling warm, I just felt depressed.

...what the hell is wrong with me?!"

"event","Here's a quick list of whats happened this weekend:

<ul type=""circle""> 
<li>studied my ass off all week to pass the speech placement test and earn the right to graduate with my class (only two kids passed last year and I got a 97)
<li>because my brother refused to go home after school, i helped the sophomores plant flowers to kill time
<li>was driving home when a car smashed into me from behind
<li>my car was smashed so hard from the back, the metal is rippled by the wheel and the door will not shut correctly.  I wasn't even at fault.  I had to handle the EMTS, the firefighters (who were making fun of me), the police officers, and the parents of the girl who hit me all alone. I refused to go to the hospital in the ambulance
<li>my dad arrived finally and he took me to the doctor.  I thought I was fine at the time. Doctor tells me that I have whiplash.
<li>Later that night, my back starts to hurt
<li>Saturday I thought I was going to die, but i needed service hours for NHS, so I went to the Arboretum
<li>stayed for two hours and then I couldn't do it anymore, so I endured the volunteer lady yelling at me about leaving early and went home
<li>Sunday I had a difficult time standing up and kneeling down and sitting in Mass.  Felt like a heathen
<li> Mom decided that she wanted to walk all over Frisco mall.  Great.
<li>We ate all day long, then went to see Kingdom of Heaven (which was hot)
<li>I'm still in a lot of pain and shudder to think about trying to carry a backpack and sit for long amounts to time tomorrow.
</ul>

Guess I'll see you tomorrow, then."

"event","I was debating if I should even go into this, write an ugly comment, or just laugh.  For my own peace of mind, I'm going to respond to this lovely comment someone made about me: 

<i>And Shelly. Shelly is this little holier-than-thou-bitch who acts like sex is a mortal sin when we all know if she's still a virgin it's only because she's a fat little snob. She wore this dress with open cups on it that were too big for her tits and I can imagine the reason for that was she had to go a few sizes larger to get the rest of her into it. Yeah, I'm being cruel, but I am honestly just fucking sick of her. </I>

<i>Shelly is this little holier-than-thou-bitch who acts like sex is a mortal sin</i>
Sorry kiddo, sex before marriage is a VENIAL sin.  I guess to have morals of any kind nowadays is ""sinful"" in the eyes of society.  Funny, you, who always talk about going against society and society's rules are now telling me to conform and have sex.  Yes, I get uncomfortable talking about sex in class.  WHY?! Because that subject is taboo in my household. Oh, and YOU make it about twenty times more uncomfotable than it has to be.

<i>when we all know if she's still a virgin it's only because she's a fat little snob.</I>
Yes, I am still a virgin and I'm not ashamed of it.  I don't care if you tease me about that.  I know I'm overweight, that's not a big eureka.  But I've working hard to lose weight and I've lost a good fifteen pounds since Christmas.  And you're no pixie yourself.  Am I a snob?  Maybe.  But I try hard to be nice and/or tolerant to/of you which is more than you can say about yourself. 

<i>She wore this dress with open cups on it that were too big for her tits and I can imagine the reason for that was she had to go a few sizes larger to get the rest of her into it. </i>
I have never tried on a dress that was too big for Thing 1 and Thing 2.  Newsflash: They're HUGE!  and unmanagable.  Do I like them big?  Do I wake up in the morning everyday and say ""Thank you, God, for giving me huge boobs?""  HELL NO!  I wish more than everyone else that they were smaller.  But just because I am ""blessed,"" doesn't mean that I shouldn't wear anything but tee-shirts.  I like wearing stuff from the junior section at Kohl's.  And if that means that I have to show a little more than comfortable, I don't care.  And speaking of showing a little more, I am aware that my dress was low cut.  I wasn't sure how low cut until later, but how could you look at that dress on a hanger and <i>not</i> buy it?  It was the perfect dress for me (other than the neckline) so I bought it.  And here's another shocker for you- my BOOBS are what make me have to buy a bigger dress.  I had to lace myself into the dress really tight so it didn't fall off.  And the top was a) sewn strangely without enough support and b) pulled like it was because of the twins.        

And in regards to the you refusing to pay at Avanti's, perhaps you have never REALLY worked before.  To serve a table filled with fifteen people at 2 in the morning is a lot of work.  So they forgot one person, big deal. They did bring you your meal and it was just as good as everyone else's.  If your tab is your tab than fine.  Cheat the restaurant like a liar and a mooch.  But when there is ONE tab, you HAVE to pay your way.  Why was a ""being such a bitch about you paying or not?""  Because <i>decent</i> people like Sara were going to pay $40 for a $10 meal.  That's crap!  And even if Sara is too sweet to say anything to you about it, don't you dare think that I am just going to sit back and watch you indirectly take advantage of her or anyone else that I care about.  Maybe someone forgot to teach you simple things about life like TOLERANCE and THINKING OF OTHERS.  I'm sure that I can't say anything without being a ""holier-than-thou bitch"". But I'd rather be a bitch to people that deserve it than an egoistical jerk to everyone.

I'm done."

"event","I'm really tired.  So from hence forth, I'll be writing in stream of conciousness, Sound of the Fury style.

went to Baylor for interview for technical theater and was fully grilled by the entire staff of professors was given a full tour of the technical aspects and was thoroughly excited about it. remember kindertransport for junior year? they were putting on that production that night and the set was incredible it looked like a messy bedroom with boxes and crap strewn everywhere but it was built in a circular theater and the tech people created train tracks around the set using wood (bendable luanne) and the coolest part was that the set looked like it was bursting forth from behind a huge page of the Torah.  they took the Torah to a printing place and blew it up so it covered the entire cyc pretty much and it was curling around the edges like the set really did run right through, it felt so ""in your face"" and crushing....so awesome.  but i had to go see the freshman plays (which were kind of gay, scratch that REALLY gay) and i couldn't see the performance.  hey, want to hear something funny? baylor is doing noises off next semester.  they were really impressed that i had seen/worked with both of those plays and then they asked me the question the always scares me most of all: where am i going to specialize?  i dunno, so i told them that i didn't have the experience in all fields to be able to make a worthwhile decision and that i planned to learn everything...to my surprise they seemed impressed or something...weird

dun dun dun dun congradualations to me.  they called and told me that i've been accepted to do tech theater...wahoo.  i'm so excited, i just can't hide it. in reality, im excited about going to baylor now, i talked with girls rooming in north russell (even though i will be in south russell but supposedly they are like the same) and they seemed really nice and everyone is friendly

so here are some key question for yall
*going to baylor? if not, where are you going?
*if yes, what dorm are you staying in?
*what orientation are you going to?
*who else do you know is going?
*why am i so tired?

way to decipher my weird way of writing
youre a haus for making it this far

"event","Woohoo, band kids are back!  I'd write all about the trip, but I'm more than slightly tired so you'll just have to settle for what happened today.  Yoday I turned 18.  Yaay!  But after suffering from nausea and nasal drainage (from the polar temperatures on the bus) plus an all over lack of sleep, I didn't even make an effort to dress up or anything.  Oops.  My family attacked my car with glass paint, that made me smile.  The hypnosis thing today was strange but that recruiter dude was pretty funny (and a good sport...Darryl CHRISTOPHER MURRY Powell).  I went to get my nails done after school and then my family took me out to eat at this cute and strange restaurant.  More on that later.  I was given the Phantom of the Opera movie piano book (yessssss!), a gift card to Starbucks (with ""Now you can drink coffee!"" written on it (my parents refused to ""allow"" me to drink coffee before I turned 18.  I guess I don't have to hide it anymore) ), and a really pretty heart-shaped jewelry box that is silver and is engraved ""Happy 18th Birthday, Shelly!""  I was like YAY FAMILY!  But then my mom pulled out the last present....

"event","I wonder why I never got involved with theater earlier.  Tonight was Progressive Dinner, and it was a huge success!  I can't wait until Banquet!!  So anyway, first we chilled for a little while at Phillip's house and had Strawberry Daiqueries, quesadillas, potato skins, and other such stuff.  It was nice cause it was half and half inside and outside. Nash and I are hearby the drink mixing experts! (:  Then we traveled across Garland to go to David's house for the entree- brisket, etc.  We started talking about what we are gonna do after prom and how everyone is gay because no one can decide.  WE SHOULD PROBABLY FIX THAT!!  Anyway, then we came over here to have dessert-y food.  To my surprise, my parents were nowhere to be found....YESSS!  We ate and Audrey busted out on the piano.  HOLY CRAP, THAT GIRL CAN PLAY!!  She played, like, every Broadway song known to man and everyone sang along, including the directors (but not their husbands).  So then Nash got this brilliant idea that we should straighten Russell's hair.  So I go upstairs to get some gel and crap and...dun dun dun...people followed me.  People, I do not keep my room clean.  It's a royal mess!  I was like AHH! and picked it up really fast.  We ended up straightening Russell's hair in my room...wow, that kid looked like a completely different guy!  We decided that he looked like an emo punk rocker, ha!  Meanwhile, CG decided to belt out a song of her own...who knew that she could sing <i>like that</i>? *Shrug* We had fun making fun of the people downstairs.  And now that my room was officially open, people trapiezed up and down from and to my room.  It was a blast!  But then Schubert came into my room one time....

That was weird.

And CG's husband Dimitri tamed the wild beast of our dog, that was amazing (he picked Cerberus up!!) Finally, my parents came home and everyone leaves soon after.  


PRE-DINNER FIASCO
It all started yesterday.  I had already had a horrible day, I had Treadway that morning (ugh), Forbes told me that I have big goals but am a slacker (WTF?!!), I got screwed in those peer editing things in English (well, it really was crap, but still), seriously pondered if I am going to pass IB tests coming up, and topped it off by using a new tanning lotion that charred the hell out of my ass and upper back.  I went to the store and blew about $12 for the Dinner and attempted to make a pie out of the cheapest possible ingredients.  First of all, I don't suck at cooking/baking.  I'm usually pretty good at it.  Not today.  You know how dough usually rolls in a circle?  Nope, not this dough.  *Sigh* I worked really hard and found that my cheapo dough (from a box) and my cheapo filling (from a can) tasted like crap (what a surprise).  We chunked it.  Today, things were so bad that the chocolate chips wouldn't even melt for me.  It's true, they just refused to melt down, they stayed clumpy and gross!  Despite the liberal amounts of cooking spray I applied to the pan, my meringue cakes stayed in the pans. They weren't done in the time they were supposed to anyway.  I made a Devil's food cake with crap in the inside (caramel, chocolate, walnut) and the recide told me to garnish with whipped cream.  So I try to use the whipped cream and it FALLS OFF the cake and looked gross.  I had to gingerly wipe it off and pour the caramel on top instead.  This is when the chocolate chip rebellion came into play.  I end up just sprinkling chocolate chips and walnuts on top.  It looked...tasty? And then because of the stuff in the middle, it refused to cut easily later...argh.  I also made Cappaccino brownies, but those worked out fine.  To save face, I called Mom in for damage control.  I have been doing everything on my own, you see.  I had to cook hardcore and clean alone.  It's not because my parents refused to help me or anything.  It's just that they come home from work fairly late, so they are little use to me.  Anyway, I left slightly late and let my mom handle things when she got home (she bought cookies, cream puffs, M&Ms (in JEDI colors...weird) and raspberry tarts).  Hooray for saving the day.

I'm sleepy and tired.  Goodnight moon!"

"event","Today was low-key, just how I like it.  Oh wait.  I had to do HARD PHYSICAL LABOR today.  You see, Schubert volunteered us, her personal slaves, to unbolt, unscrew, and rebolt all of the auditorium chairs in pairs for the people that wanted them.  And guess what the best part was (besides the obvious: working in a large space infected with hesbestis, with bolts/nails poking out of the ground like daisies waiting to stab me in the foot or ass as I work, and a heavy layer of dirt and grime settling on my pants, shoes, and skin)?  Only TWO techies have to do this crap of work that chafes the hands raw and makes you want to chunk the pair of channel-locks across the room in frustration (which I did). Yes, that's right, it's me and Audrey Olena (who is a haus) and we've been the only ones during it for three class periods. And then we heard the rest of the class laughing in the hallway DOING NOTHING AS WE SLAVE AWAY!! *Sigh*  That sucks.

So in A2, I journeyed around the school trying to find a place to melt wax for those seals on the invitations without setting off the fire alarm.  Michele and I finally just did it outside, thanks dude! Because these invitations are so ""ornately decorated,"" I'm charged with hand-delivering them.  WOO.  LOL, so if YOUR parent gets one, make sure they get it on time and unscathed.  

After school, I realize that I have like no points for SNHS. Better get that taken care of, oy.  And I'm hosting desserts for ITS Progressive Dinner this Friday.  Hooray for cooking in large quantities!  Now I need to decide what to make...any ideas?

Yeah, I browned myself today.

So I'm sitting here typing away and my Dad comes to the bookshelf...:
Dad:*peering at the books* What should it be tonight, Shelly, volcanoes, floods, or earthquakes?
Me: ARGH!!  YOU ARE SUCH A NERD!! *Dad picks up a book on volcanoes and begins to read away joyously)
Mom: *carries in a load of laundry* Here, you can fold your laundry while you read.
Dad: NOOOOOOOO!! WHY ME?!?! POR QUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUE?!
Mom: *rolls eyes and walks out*
Dad: *looks around quickly, lifts up the mattress of the bed, and shoves the socks underneath* 
Mom: *comes in* Where are the socks?
Dad: *completely innocently* I folded them and put them away.

HAHAHAHAHA!!!!

My parents are so gay!

<b>OH YEAH, CHECK THIS OUT:</b> Prom dilemma has been solved!!  Adam Wheeler is taking me, what a haus. If you don't know him, he plays percussion in band.  He's going as my ESCORT because he has a girlfriend (never fear, I asked her first and An was like oh yeah, no problem! They are so awesome together)!  So I'm finally ready to acknowledge that prom is coming up! YESSSSS!  

I'm out like a light!"

"event","So for some reason, I told Dr. Bissett that I would address all the prom invitations in calligraphy.  (Wait, don't get excited, you probably don't get one- they are for officials and sponsors, etc).  Doing calligraphy takes me forever...It's not the actual lettering that I suck at.  It's that I have to go so slowly, stroke by stroke, that I often misspell words and I really suck at centering (well, not so much any more).  I used to suck at writing in a straight line, but I cheat now and slip a lined piece of paper underneath...teehee.  So it pretty much took me all day long to do about 25 of these suckers.  And then, for reasons unknown, I decide hey, I spent so much time on these already, why not COMPLETELY throw myself into it? So I decide that it would be cool to seal these with wax (and a little emprint thing).  Because I have no cool ring (besides my class ring) that I can shove into a puddle of hot wax, I convinently leave the house to go buy one.  

On my way, I stopped to go tanning.  It's kind of a game now, <U>How Can I Get Out Of The House And Go Tanning Without My Parent's Knowledge?</U>  Unfortunately I always still smell like tanning crap when I get home.  But they haven't noticed yet, so woohoo.  Marissa says she thinks I'm getting darker...*napoleon dynamite fist* yesssss! But I stll have a long way to go. Anyway, I also stopped at Kohl's and buy myself a much-needed pair of sunglasses and a wallet with a place for a checkbook (I blew 28 bucks). So I procceeded home to wrestle with trying to seal the envelopes.



<H3>IT WAS THE BIGGEST HASSLE OF MY LIFE!</H3> 

Wax dripped everywhere and the candle burned faster and faster, spewing molten wax super fast when I tried to pour it.  I was like AHH, WHAT A NIGHTMARE! as I eventually had to redo 4 of my precious envelopes. Being the genius that I am, I finally came up with the idea of extinguishing the flame inbetween pressing the rose emblem.  It dripped much slower, but the wax still pretty much burbled out from underneath the stamp like I didn't want it to.  Oh well.  

I finished up the day by fulfilling my sole purpose as the eldest daughter- taxi-ing everyone to various places.  We also made a GREEN cake to 'celebrate my going to college at Baylor'.  I think I'm driving down to go visit on Friday...BY MYSELF!! (HUGE step for my parents!) That will be pretty awesome!!

Hmm, interesting....

"event","Well, I'm officially going to Baylor.  I'm not too excited, but whatever.  I'll go there for now.  *shrug* I'm not ecstatic or even excited really.  It's too close for comfort, I suppose. Whatever.

So yesterday, I go looking for a cheap place to go tanning for a month so I don't look like Snow White at the band trip or at prom.  I find this one place called SUNTANA right by my house and stop so I can look and see what it is all about.  There is this really hott guy working the lobby table so I go over to get some information.  So he tells me that a month of tanning cost $22 if I put it on a credit card, that I'd become a member, and so stop being a member I'd have to write a letter why 30 days in advance.  So I tell him I want to pay cash for one month and he goes, ""then it's $40 a month....why don't you want to tan every month?""  I said, ""Because I don't want skin cancer, I just want to be tan for prom."" He glances down at his tanned, ripped guns, and says, ""I've been tanning here.  I don't have skin cancer.  And anyways, you have dark hair and dark eyes.  Because you have dark hair and eyes, there is a pigment in the skin that makes you resistant to skin cancer.  People with light eyes and blonde hair are the ones that get skin cancer.  But you've got that pigment, that means you're a descendent of Italy...Indian? ""  ""Mexico.""  ""Yeah, Mexico!""  So I gave him one of my looks that clearly says what-do-you-think-I-am-some-type-of-moron? and left.  Never fear though, I found another place and learned how to tan. Hooray!

I went over to CJ's house last night!  That was pretty kickass!  Everyone who went is a haus (:! Unfortunately, I woke up extremely late the following afternoon and completely missed the Nikki's meeting.  ARGH!!  I'm such a moron!!  Apparently, Gibson read her LJ.  That is incredibly creepy and if you are reading this right now, Gibson, STOP RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THAT'S SICK! Anyway, from what I heard, it went well.  Moo did say that she was glad I wasn't there.  There's a heartwarming sentiment from a close friend.  Alas, it seems that I am now ""too cynical to be happy or excited about anything anymore"".  Sorry, I guess.  Although, I distinctly remember smiling and laughing with people every period of the day at school...I suppose that that doesn't count.

Whatever."

But I decided that you, my fellow readers, were more important.

WELL, it's official.  I don't want to be a lawyer.  Is it because I crashed down in Debate the worst in the history of the school?  Is it because I am incapable of formulating a coherent thought in mere seconds?  No.  It's because I can't fight for the other side.  (The case was: A retarded guy bought a gun at the store, came home and accidently shot himself in the face.  The store, my ""client"" was being sued for damages.  Hello?!  There is no getting around the fact that the gun was sold illegally.  (It didn't help that I hadn't looked at the case in two weeks and had an underclassmen write them down for me...*sigh*) So I went down in flames.) Oh well.

Last week was Theater UIL.  Woohoo, we advanced twice and are going on!  Yay! I got to hand out the medals and trophies at the awards assembly. That was pretty awesome. (:

Tonight was SHARE night.  In contrast to last year, I didn't volley back and forth between eight different booths. I stayed in Band and ITS.  Good thing they were right next to each other.

"event","HOORAY!!  Today's the day!  I washed my car at last! (My dad started threatening me) Yes yes, it's true.  My car was slowly but surely turning into a black vehicle...not that a black 'Stang wouldn't be hot, but red IS my color... Man, you would not believe how dirty <i>I</i> got washing that car!  I looked African!! (j/k!) But guess what I had in my backseat that made it worth staying nasty.


<H1>FLOWERS! HECK YES!</H1>

(If you don't know me too well and you've never seen my room, I have a deck outside that sometimes is covered with potted flowers, twinkle lights, and reclining chairs, kind of like a private oasis.  Since winter came around, I have had a private zone of death instead. Also, I am somewhat fanatic about gardening when I have the chance.  If you ever need to get me a gift...well, you get the picture.)

I had to drive home this freshmen from another day's ""hard"" work at the PAC (yeah, we did nothing again.  AND Garland's play doesn't even make sense).  On my way home, I passed a nursery and decided to stop. I spent six dollars and was so happy it was sickening.  As I was happily planting after I washed the car, managing to further cover myself in crap, my sister happened to see that I had bought a snapdragon and wanted to go buy one for herself.  Never wanting to discourage a budding (ha, no pun intended) gardener, I take her to Walmart (curse that damn place!).  We had to wade through a moat to look at the flowers because this fag worker was watering the plants <i>while on the phone!!</i> HELLO?! ELECTROCUTION MUCH?! Anyway, there were no snapdragons, so I bought like a salvia or something.  And then, I saw it.  A huge, mondo trashcan filled to brim with Easter lilies, mashed and mushed together in a gigantic leafy mass.  I wanted to cry! They were still alive!!  So I asked the cell phone worker what they were gonna do with them and he was like chunk 'em.  So I asked if I could have one.  I took three.  (:  LOL!  I'll probably come back tomorrow and save some more. Stupid, wasteful Walmart!! So I enriched my balcony and therefore encouraged myself to go tanning more often. I'm sure the world will thank me for that! Yay today!

Well, I'm off to go watch LOST, the best TV program EVER!!  CIAO!"

Well, what was I expecting?

Well, today I was field tripped out of school.  To do what, you might ask?  Well, I'm on ""site crew"" because we are hosting UIL Theater at the PAC...which basically means I get out of school all this week to sit on my ass (until Thursday, when I get to dress up and hand trophies to winners).  Oh wait.  When we told the Sachse kids that they needed to be a little quieter, one of them hissed at me.  Then we told them it was time to go onstage in ten minutes, they were like ""Alright, alright we know already, now leave."" JERKS! You would think n00bs would be a little more respectful considering tHIS IS THEIR FIRST TIME AT UIL!!  I guess not.  So was it fun?  Nope.  Worth getting out of school? Definitely. (except for Bissett's class) (They gave us food from Cafe Max.) Hopefully I've have something better to report tomorrow.  Cheers!

Actually, I am gonna post my opinion on the Schiavo case.  I don't understand why people are vying to keep her alive.  She has no hope of ever returning to coherence and she is eating up tax payers money to have the ability to blink her eyes.  Other sick people that could have a chance at life could be using her place in the hospital.  And other than that, it's her husband's decision, not the country's!  I don't think that the government has a place to interfere with this decision.   When you get married, your parents no longer have a say in anything in your life.  But your spouse does.  The spouse can sign for you to get an operation and he can sign to terminate the life of his baby if the mother's life is in jeopardy.  I think the parents just need to let go of ther daughter and accept her death, like their son-in-law and allow her to move on.  Eh, that's just my opinion.  What do you think?"

"event","Well, I <i>was</i> going to write a long speal on my visit to San Antonio and why going there makes me feel sad and lost and a few pointers on trying to understand what goes on inside my head every day. Fortunately for you, I am tired and don't really feel up to to explaining things clear enough for you to understand.  (I do have one question tho, do ya'll often sit hip-to-hip with other people?  We had to mash people to fit on couches and things and we were all sitting hip-to-hip comfortably and I'm wondering if this is normal?)

HIGHLIGHT OF MY TRIP: (other than seeing a real monkey in a onesie swinging around in someone's car) It was my dad's birthday and we made him a cake with a happy birthday candle on the top.  We sang to him and he blew it out.  Then, someone was like ""it was Roy's birthday last week!"" So we relit the same candle and sang to my uncle.  Someone else shouted ""It's Debbie and Ernie's one year anniversary!"" So that same candle was lit, we sang, and they blew it out together.  Then, my dad goes ""Shelly's gonna graduate in two months!"" So yes, we lit the happy birthday candle, sang, and I blew out the candle for the final time.  Haha, so ghetto! Sup, Mexicans?!

Today kind of sucked.  Dunno why, it just did.  There was this weird guy (well, technically he was a man) that was wildly motioning in band today.  I made the most horribly faces trying to see who he was trying to meet eyes with (I actually thought it was Nikki). Then I realized he was trying to talk to me.  He gave me a card with his name on it and told me to give it to my dad.  Weird... 

After SNHS, I was trying to leave when my faithful car died in the parking lot.  Well, it was about time, I had been driving it on E for two days, so I realize it's my fault.  Oops.  Blessen is a haus and he drove me to the gas station (although I had to buy a gas canister, grr) so I got the car started and drove to the gas station.  It isn't a big deal now, but I was pretty upset at the time. *shrug*

I thought that everyone in NHS was supposed to bring stuff for induction today.  So I looked at cookies and they were eight dollars for two boxes and decided to make a cake instead (two dollars including icing).  So I spent the majority of the evening before Pre-UIL making this faggo cake (which looked pretty good in the end).  I plan on taking this cake (Chocolate Brownie Fudge with Strawberry White Chocolate Almond Icing) to induction after UIL and stick it in my car.  Then I found out that we didn't play until 8 (even though call was 6:50).  So we played and did pretty well (even if the sight-reading was a mite difficult) and I wound up still having this cake in my car.  So I took it out of the car and let various band nerds rip off chunks with their fingers.  Go band! (:

<B>Ok, I still desperately need a date to prom.  I get in free AND I get free pictures.  I know it's getting late, BUT PLEASE, if you can think of someone who would be willing to take me LET ME KNOW!</B>

Hmm, does this sound like me? (:


The luncheon was gay, but those who chose not to go were gay-er.  Did anyone else notice that ALL of the South officials spoke with a hick accent?  Coincidence...?  That speaker dude cracked me up. (""Say it together with me, 'cracked me up'"") I'm pretty sure my bus sucked the most.  There was NO ONE on it (well, Thomas and Ana) and I pretty much felt like a loser. *tear* Good thing it was only fifteen minutes to get there because getting crammed on a stuffy bus with 50 other kids I don't know is not an experience I'd like to repeat. Yay for college and the end of gay buses!

FYI: The computers are school are even more impossible than I thought.  NEVER USE THEM UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE!!  They are WORTHLESS!  Anyway, I did the prom booklet a while and spent a lot of time looking for a font that was fancy and legible at the same time.  Woohoo, I found one, used it, and everything was peachy.  Then Bissett edited a hardcopy of the booklet so I had to type out the changes today after the luncheon.  The gay computer wouldn't read the disk with the font on it, deleted half of the file, changed my sizings, and basically just made life suck for me.  And...dun dun dun, the file had to be finished any sent away to print today.  So I careened out of the parking lot and headed for home speeding like whoa.  I get all the way home, fix the mistakes, bring it all the way back (and manage to change while the fourteen pages were printing).  By the way, my gas gauge was under the E when I went home for the first time.  So moments after I get home, my little sister bursts through the door and says, ""I'll give you $5 to take me to the mall!""  I was like oooh, five bucks...why do you need to go to the mall? Apparently, she had left her Converses in her locker and wanted to go buy some more.  I told her that was the gayest thing I had ever heard and drove her to Austin (Academy, not the city) instead.  I yammered on the locked door and this assistant principal? walks out with a scowl.  I put on my I'm-just-as-good-as-you face and told him (in my ""mature"" voice) that Selena needed to get her shoes.  We got the tenis and left for home.  I have yet to collect my five bucks...
 
Well kids, I have sad news.  Yes, very sad news indeed.  I will soon be leaving dear old Garland and peevishly sitting smushed in the backseat of an truck for the 5.5 hours to San Antonio.  Of course that means that you won't get to read about my crazy adventures for a whole three days.  Crushing, I know. So I suppose I'll let you go with a simple reminder: Don't be dumb, be thankful for everything that you've had, everything you have, and everything that you will have.  If for some reason, I don't come back from this trip, remember that I care about and love you and I pray that you can say the same for me. :) Be safe and have fun!

Ok, so at first we were told that there were gels (light colors) and then yesterday the dude working there was ike ""we don't carry any.""  I KNEW that was a lie. So I decided to find them myself and snooped around.  To make a long story short, I not only found enough gels to completely wash the stage with but I managed to cut them to the right size with a ghetto pocket knife.  THIS IS DARING- 6 GELS COST $40 AND THEY WEREN'T EVEN OURS!! (to make sure that the fag manager dude wasn't upset with me, I pretended to ""need his advice"" on color placement.  He was so excited to help me out, he KEPT giving me advice throughout the night.) Anyway, Nikki and Brandon totally stole the show with their bizarre dance moves (and Michele survived being smacked over the head, go you!) and it was a lot of fun cueing my own show (without Schubert)(that crazy whore) and talking/singing over the headset with Michelle (elephants live where, Michelle? Hahaha!!). And that was last night.

After school today was both band and Light Brigade.  I have been missing both left and right, but since LB has fewer people and they are pissed off at me anyway, I went to that.  (still not sure why I'm still in it, definitely not fun.) We finished at 4 and I meander my way over to band an hour late, hoping to keep my existence quiet.  So I'm just getting seated when Becca pokes me in the ribs and says, ""Hey, isn't that your brother?"" I looked- lo and behold!  There he was, lurking near the door and staring at me.  So I get up while B is talking and find out he needs a ride and that he put his stuff on top of my car.  WHO THE HECK PUTS CRAP ON TOP OF A 'STANG?! What a moron! I told him to wait 30 minutes and go back to my seat right in front of B (who hadn't stopped jabbering). Not even 5 minutes later, I see the queer again, skulking around.  Once again B is talking, so right under his nose I gestured and mouthed to him, trying to find out what he wanted. The keys.  He wanted the keys.  Hell no.  Last time I let him have the keys, he thought he would be a bawler if he sat in the driver's seat and turned on the car.  He didn't/doesn't know about standards, I suppose, because when he turned it on, he jumped off the clutch and the car lurched foward, mere inches from smashing into a chain fence.  So then he mouths that he will bring them back.  And I take the keys out of my pocket and send them sailing across the room to him.  And B is still talking.  He comes back and walks halfway over to the band (for reasons unknown, we are still squished into just the back half of the room).  He was making gay faces and made a huge show of sliding the keys back to me. And B is STILL talking.  (Honestly, the Apocalypse could happen and he would continue to ramble on!)

So much for my brilliant plan to stay on the DL. (:

Yeah, luncheon tomorrow! No Spanish! WOOO! I'm OUT!





Wow, could it have been any more awkward? *sigh*"

"event","I have a new rule that is destined to bring everyone's heart rate down AND cause less wrecks in the SENIOR parking lot:  Parents are not allowed to pick up their kids in the back parking lot.  It's crazy back there.  Parents have this incredible need to reunite themselves with their child after the terribly long eight hours that we spend in school.  I don't have a problem with this.  Yay good parenting. Problems start because until the child is ""safely"" in the car, the parents have a get-the-kid-at-all-costs mentality.  They don't care about courtesy to fellow drivers.  They certainly don't care about the students trying to get out of the already congested back parking lot. Oh no!!  THE CHILD and THEMSELVES are the only reasons for living.  This fag mentality is what keeps you waiting forever behind some car that refuses to move and risk losing visual contact with THE CHILD.   

Underclassmen that can't drive yet, it sucks to be you.  But should you really make life suck for everyone else around you (more than you already do?)

"event","<i>Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantlepiece, and his hyperdermic syringe from it's neat Morocco case.  With his long, white, nervous, fingers he adjusted the delicate needle and rolled back his left shirtcuff.  For some time his eyes rested thoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm and wrist, all dotted with innumerable puncture-marks.  Finally he thrust the sharp point home, pressed the tiny piston, and sank back into the velvet-lined armchair with a sigh of satisfaction.  

""What is it to-day,"" I asked, ""morphine or cocaine?""

""It is cocaine,"" Sherlock Holmes replied.  ""I find it transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mind.  Would you care to try it?"" </I>

So.  Sherlock Holmes...""one of the most beloved fictional characters ever created"" is a druggie.  That is so depressing I can't even start to rant.  Yeah, I ran across this last night in (real) Sherlock Holmes novel.  I almost threw the book.

*Sigh*

This morning B came up to me and informed me that Honors Band was getting surprise pizza and that I should coordinate it.  Naturally, I agree and attempt to phone the PIzza Hut on Buckingham.  I think their phone is broken, because I dialed the number I had, 411's number, AND the number from some other Pizza Hut and they still didn't answer.  So I ended up ordering from the PH in South Garland and had to drive all the way home basically to get it.  But the pizza was all just a ruse- a ruse to keep us quiet and have B talk/lecture to us on our lunch break. And then he gave us the stupidest shirts ever...Honors Band shirts.  So gay.  What about all the other bands?  Why do they get gypped?  Band is so corrupt.

Speaking of band, I'm working the lights for the percussion show!  We had the dress today.  It's strange, doing lights for band because up until now, I've been living two lives: one band, one techie.  And now they are merging and I feel like two different people at the same time.  I think Ramirez is surprised that I know what I'm doing in something other than band, haha.  Oh well.  The show's gonna be great: <b>Plaza Theater tomorrow at 8pm!</b>

Speaking of techie work....I GOT PAID!!  YAHOO!!  $275, BABY!  (and what do I get for Percussion show? $0. Figures.) I want to spend it on the prom dress, but think of all the earrings I could buy...(:"

"event","I can't believe Spring Break is over.  It's so sad!  *sigh* On to more interesting things.  Like last night.  Apparently, Sara's speech party/surprise birthday party started at noon and for some reason I wrote down three.  So Mari called me demanding to know where I was and I pretty much sped over to Sachse at eighty miles an hour.  She did a great job!  I was like, wow, Sara's pretty good at oral speaking.  Then, we distracted her to bring out the cake.  It was cute!  Who was there, you ask? Well, Marissa and her little sis, CJ, Katie, Meredith, Bonnie, and Whitney with her two sisters in tow (wow, they all look exactly alike!) We had loads of fun and then decided to go over to Bonnie's house to continue the awesomeness (now it's Bonnie, CJ, Marissa, Sara, Katie, and Becca showed up).  We watched the Incredibles...and playe Truth or Dare.  Probably one ofthe best nights all SB.  I need to go, Mom's yelling!"

"event","Tomorrow is the Feast of St. Joseph so we went to Mass today...in Italian.  You see, St. Joseph is Italy's patron saint and they construct a huge alter celebrating his being the head of the Holy family.  The alter itself is beautiful: it's about three tables tall and covered with fruit, statuettes, Italian sweets, and loads and loads of bread.  They would use the dough to mold things like clay: there are actual scenes made of just bread! Anyway, the Italians in the area decided they wanted to have a celebratory Mass in Italian and invite everyone from the parish.  Of course we decide that we're gonna go.  

I don't speak Italian.

All the Italians there didn't feel the need to teach us the basic syllables of Italian and since it WAS a Catholic Mass (and you need to respond to things) I soon learned that Italian and Spanish ARE NOT the same!

<i>Auitatinni ali bisogni,
a l'estrimi nicissita</i>

Any ideas on how to pronounce this?  It was said very musically, like a jingle. I said ""AH oo tah tinny ally big so nee a les treemee nee see see tah"" It means ""help me in my needs and extreme necessity.""  Well, it was hard enough to try to decipher the Mass, but then there were these girls behind me that wouldn't stop talking/laughing/playing on their cell phones.  HOW DISRESPECTFUL!  I tried to ignore it, but it was so distracting so I decided that I would tell them something...

Me: ""So how old are you?""
Them: ""Umm, well, we're in the sixth grade...so twelve I guess..."" 
Me: ""And how long have you been going to church?""
Them: ""Oh, ever since we were really little...""
Me: ""Oh, so I guess it's not news to you that people don't talk in the middle of Mass.  And by the way, the entire church can hear you.""
Them: ""Oh, sorry!!""

Unfortunately, this accomplished nothing...they contined to talk and now openly ""mugged"" me.  Kids today.

So then I went to Beth's and we decided that we should go see a dollar movie.  Because we were taking Moosta, our options were limited to PG movies ergo we chose Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events.  And then we got the grand idea that we should dress up...weird. Here's what we came up with...

<b>Moo:</B> Pink ruffled ""prom"" dress that looked like car ran over it.  Tiara.  Tenis.  Earrings.
<b>Bu: </B>Black jazz pants with silver tube top as skirt.  Orange mesh shirt.  Leather vest.  Wedge heels. Orange sash tied around the head.  Hair in twin messy buns Princess Lei style.
<b>Me: </B> Leotard that zips down the front.  Black miniskirt.  Hooker boots.  Black eyeliner.  Silver belt.  Black feather duster. 

And yes, we actually went out like that.  Can you guess who coordinated everyone's outfit? *coughBETHANYcough*

The movie was good, both plot-wise and technically.  As nerdy as it sounds, I really liked the architecture and theme tie-ins. (: After the movie we accidentally stayed up until 5:30 playing...dun dun dun...Donkey Kong (on the Super Nintendo).  I've never played it before, but it sure was addicting!  

I woke up the next morning at 12 and sped over to the church as the Feast of St. Josephs was today.  All free Italian food, baby!  I'm pretty sure cannolis are God-sent.  I must learn how to make them...for the sake of my children...

Off to Sara's ""speech"" party!"

"event","I have the misfortune of being in Performing Arts Endorsement.  To be honest, I don't know how it happened. I never auditioned for it or anything.  They just assumed that I should be in it (well, to be fair, I was taking all the classes of a PAE candidate).  So now, I'm through with the classes part of it and all I have left to do is to go see 12 shows (I'm halfway through) and perform a senior recital.  And because theater is a hell of a lot more interesting to watch then listening to a bunch of bands, I have decided to go see plays.

Thus, we wound up at the Pocket Sandwich Theater.  

It's a tiny place right next to Mockingbird Station (near Jason's Deli...) and luckily, we (that is, Marissa, Jamoo, and I) found it with little trouble.  It's in a kind of shady area so Moo was already going, ""I have a bad feeling about this place..."" Of course Marissa and I rolled our eyes.  Then we saw him...There was this weird midget dude wearing a gigantic green Cat-In-The-Hat hat and long necklaces of green Mardi Gras beads smoking a pipe.  He pointed a gnarled finger at me and wheezed, ""You aren't wearing green...!""  It was true, I was in black and pink.  BUT, (after a violent battle with my little sister who tried to pinch me) I had foreseen the fact that weirdos would try to pinch me and I tied green Mardi Gras beads to my purse.  Well, as soon as he said that and started getting closer, I held my purse up as an amulet or something and showed him the green before sprinting inside the theater.  As soon as we got inside and seated, I put the beads on for safety reasons.. (:  It's a cute little place, you get to eat as you watch the show (which is so close that you could throw popcorn at the actors if you didn't like it).  I had something called a pepperoni pizza pita (pita is English for taco, I decided), which they rolled like a burrito and then served me tortilla chips with a pickle.  What kind of weird place serves all that together?!  AND without salsa?!  (WE did end up asking for salsa anyway)  Haha, during intermission, we were talking about prom and Marissa was like ""I need a date"" and Moo, trying to be funny, goes ""You can have mine,"" before realizing what she said. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!!  It was so funny!  So after the show (which was good), Marissa decides that she doesn't want to go home.  So we try to go to Starbucks and get kicked out (""Umm, ladies?  We actually closed fifteen minutes ago..and we are kicking those people out..."") so we go to Tom Thumb.  IT was really gay running around in Tom Thumb, we looked at the makeup (cheap crap), then the hair dyes (should I dye my hair?), and the flowers (...can't wait to get married...or get rich, whichever comes first).  So we took Marissa home after that and Moo and I spent the night at my house.  

THE END...!"

"event","So I went with Missy to go see The Jacket this evening.  You thought Ceremony was difficult to interpret? Go see The Jacket.  It did some weird things with time...very weird things that are never really explained.  But to be fair, the acting was fantastic and Keira pulled off an American accent surprisingly convincingly.  I really like her eye makeup...*note to self: learn what brand of eyeshadow she uses...* I liked the movie overall, even if some of it was quite far-fetched.  

I'm not sure why, but my tolerance level for annoying people is very low tonight.  I think it's my dad's fault.  You see, every time he sees me, he asks me if I have asked someone to prom.  Every time, I'm like no, Dad, I haven't.  You would think he would take the hint and leave me alone about it.  But no.  EVERY TIME he sees me.  And then he always procceeds to ask me stupid questions that are pointless and gay.  I know it's because he cares about me and wants to talk to me, but really.  There are other ways!! Gaah...parents. 

If you've never been over to my house before, let me tell you something about our family: EVERYONE plays at least one instrument.  So that means that everyone has to practice their said instrument(s) (loudly) fairly often.  Add my brother's stereo system (that is roughly the size of the entire back seat of my Mustang) and things are NEVER quiet here.  After all these years of listening to the family scream, screech, play, and blare the music, I'm faintly surprised that I'm not crazy.  Tonight, all that noise is irritating me to no end.  Imagine not even being able to escape into your room because the noise is all around you and your doors are see-through.  It's like living in a windowed box!!  It's driving me mad!!  I really need some quiet...as we speak, my dad is wailing notes on the trumpet two octaves below the intended range. *Sigh* WHY the need to play that low?!  WHY does it have to be right in MY ear?!  WHO decided that noise can be classified as ""music"" and were they smoking weed?!

I need to go back to school and get away from here. Hahahaaa, that sounds so pathetic."

"event","So Marissa and I decided that we need to go dress shopping for prom today.  So for reasons unknown, we decide to go to Whatchamacallit.  Why did we decide to go there?  What were we thinking?  The world may never know.

Before we went there, we stopped by at Special Occasions.  Nothing too eventful happened there, excptthat weird Russian lady poked her head into my dressing room at THE WORST TIME POSSIBLE and was like oh, there's someone in here.  NO DUH, LADY!!  *sigh* Salespeople... 

We arrive at Whatchamacallit and the shop is pretty much a cross between a mob scene and a swimming pool (of dresses).  There are so many people/dresses there it's sickening.  Everything is super close together and you know how those poof dresses are in now?  Yeah, walking was EXTREMELY difficult.  If for some reason, someone that works at Whatchamacallit is reading this, a little word of advice straight from me to you:  ORGANIZE YOUR STUPID STORE!!!  They just hung dresses up everywhere, no regard to size, color, or type.  And people were STEPPING on $400 dresses!  So Mari and I are floundering about trying to find a red one (for me of course) or a yellow one (for Mari, definitely NOT for me).  And Mari is finding dress after dress and is like OOOH, PRETTY!  And I can't find anything that isn't a) Trashy  b) Ugly  c) My size  d) Even remotely awesome.

And then, I see it....*angels sing in the background*

It's gorgeous, it's perfect, it's my size!! I try it on and gasp at the AWESOMENESS!!  I look like the SPANISH QUEEN!!  YAY!!  I walked out of the dressing room and some fag saleslady comes over and starts clapping at me.  WTF?  She's like THIS IS IT!! THE ONE YOU'RE BEEN SEARCHING FOR!!  Of course, I was exulted at the time and fervently agreeing (but in my mind I was thinking: <i>How would you know, lady?!</i>)  So she looks for the price and tells me it's <h1> $375!!!!!</h1> AHH!!  So I contemplate putting it on layaway but if I can't afford it, I lose that money so I don't.  My parents laughed at me when I told them.  They told me to get out of that store and who told me I was allowed to even try on $300 dresses?  *Sigh*  I might be able to buy it myself with my ENTIRE paycheck from Spring Show, but who knows when T will pay us?  Last year, I think they forgot altogether...!  So I left that heaven-sent dress and went on to Valley View Mall (after a scruptous lunch at The Corner Bakery).  We went to Penneys and I found a pink dress that I liked.  But after that perfect one, it seemed...cheap?  

We piddled around at the mall for a while, playing with the weird crabs at Earthbound Trading Company, laughing at all the ugly crap at Claire's, wishing for a massage at that Water Massage Place.  And then we saw Victoria Secret and decided we'd go smell the lotions or something gay like that.  But some saleslady is like ""Try this new Imax bra, it feels like butter...""  So she makes us touch the bra on this mannequin (kinda weird) and we agree, ""yeah lady, soft like butter, mmhmm..."" Unfortunately, she kept pestering us to try it until I get fed up and agree.  So she waltzes over to the dressing rooms and hands me not just the Imax bra, oh no.  She hands me an ENTIRE BOX of my size and was like, I'll be in later to check if it fits... :-/  So I put on this other bra that looked hotter and she came in the room, with this other chic in tow.  (WTF?! Party in my dressing room?!)  Anyway, they were both talking, pointing, and touching various parts of the bra and it was WEIRD!  I'm not sure why I wrote about this...LOL.  Just to emphasize the fact that salespeople are strange, I suppose.  

And that was my day!

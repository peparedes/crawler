"event","What do we think of the situation in France? J'y irai, savez-vous? En mars/avril. I'll be less than an hour away, I'm quite excited. I want to get shot at a barricade...hehehe. This is my unhealthy obsession with Les Miz talking. I should give it a French name as it is veritably an entity. But you know, now they'll probably cancel the whole thing, since America is quite stupid about such things.

What if the Mexicans get the same idea? o.o

There is a dire and lamentable lack of Gauntfic out there, especially of Gauntcest.

I intend to try to rectify this."

Must lose weight. Fat.

Not much to say. About a month until I leave. As in move. 

I'm quite tired.

My new favourite HP pairing in the world is Merope/Morfin. <3 It makes perfect sense and is as close to canon as you can get without saying anything outright. Honestly.

I love fanart. Too bad I can't draw. At all. When I move I'll have to make some friends who will teach me, or at least draw pictures for me. :P I have a whole list of things that I'd like for people to teach me how to do -

How to draw okay
How to do DDR really well
How to speak another language (Love languages)
How to not be scared of video games. (I love them, but they're scary when you're getting shot at, y0!)
How to PWN maths!

But nevermind that. Everybody say yay for Holly getting into Altrincham! We're both going to be the new girls, albeit several thousand miles apart... and she gets a suit, dag nabbit. We're both going to schools that are kind of hard to say, because I'm silly and can't say Altrincham Girls Grammar School very well, and I'll be going to the *deep breath* Las Vegas Academy of International Studies, Performing and Visual Arts. Hahaha. That's why we call it LVA, I guess! But I like Altrincham better, it sounds so mature and respectable and old and just wonderful.

I have so many ideas for stories. I'm so inspired. Sort of? My left boob hurts and I don't know why.

Okay I'll be done now.

Except SIX DAYS UNTIL VOLDIE AND SEVERUS! Um, I totally meant HARRY! I need a tie!"

"event","Well today kind of sucked. I woke up very early, and I came in here to find that the fucking terrorists are after London now. It's worse than September 11, I care a lot more. London is such a wonderful place. When they went after New York and D.C., mind you, for a month or two more I live fifteen minutes from the capital, it wasn't as horrible as this.

 And as I was upstairs making cupcakes this afternoon and watching the History Channel, four more people died because of that attack. 

Understand that we can't leave the terrorists alone. They will not go away if we pull out of Iraq and Afghanistan, they will only get stronger and get bigger weapons and more people will die. So stop protesting the war, okay? If you want to save lives, ending the war on terrorism is not the way.

And I've fucking been to King's Cross station. Why was I there on that day, and not today? Why? They were just people on their ways somewhere, what makes them different from me?

The one good thing about today is that I found out there is a library where I'm going to hang out on the fifteenth of July before Pothead comes out because awesome things are happening there. Yeah. I'm going to ask my best friend to come with me. I never see her and that is sad, I've known her since she was a day old. And I don't even need to bum a ride from my parents anymore, haha. Technically I'm not supposed to drive with under 18 people who aren't related to me, but forget that, she's my sister. So there.

I'm just going to go hate these damned Islamic factions whose terrorist acts contradict everything their Koran says, bye."

"event","Whoa. Just wow. Congratulations to sparklers, which have succeeded in being awesome in more ways than anyone could have foreseen. They were gold. I had lots of fun, I stood on my front porch and defied the law, Javert would be shocked. :-P I wrote words and sentences and now the whole sky is echoing with explosions. But in a good way, not like London in WWII. I've got the window open, and Tori fits right in...I must learn this song for school, I'm starting a whole list. Yes, I decided this just now.

I have $270.03 and some more change. Do you know what I'm spending it on? A passport and a plane ticket. Actually, I don't think I have enough yet, but I have two more years of saving up my lunch money. Hahaha, it's really rather exhilarating.

Did I tell you about my sexy adventure to Goodwill that I took forever ago? I got a skirt. BUT I ALSO GOT A HARRY POTTER PURSEY THING. IT'S PURPLE AND GLITTERY AND IT'S GOT LITTLE FIRST YEAR HARRY, RON, HERMIONE AND I THINK NEVILLE BUT SOMEBODY ELSE IN A BOAT. AND THE SKY IS PURPLE. AND GLITTERY. AND THERE'S HOGGY WARTY HOGWARTS. It was two dollars, but it was on sale for one. *dies of happies* I'll post a picture if my camera ever turns up. Or I could just use the scanner, if all else fails. I think it was meant for kiddos, but uh...I can be young. I'm only 16, I'm just a kid!

Guess what. I'm really moving. *giggle*"

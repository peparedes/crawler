"event","<P>Due to tremendous stress, and a need to outlet my problems to something that won't offer me advice without pointing out that their personal problems are more cosmopolitan, I have decided to repost entries in my livejournal.&nbsp; I've been having a terrible day, all day.&nbsp; It seems like I have to do everything twice, and all this extra work.&nbsp; For example, I had recently just completed this entry and for some reason the computer decided to freeze.&nbsp; Thus, I am here writing this again.&nbsp; Luck, right?</P>
<P>So, anyway let me begin at ... the beginning (DUH).&nbsp; So, I woke up early this morning (circa 7 a.m.) to finish the powerpoint presentation to accompany my speech I had to present at 8 a.m.&nbsp; Well, I woke up a little late, and tried to immediately begin work on my presentation.&nbsp; Well, I forgot that I should have taken a few seconds to let my eyes readjust to light, and when I looked at the computer screen I cried.&nbsp; I cried because my eyes hurt so damn bad.&nbsp; (I know I usually cry for no reason, but pain...)&nbsp; So, after wasting that time cleaning my eyes with a tissue from a floor (the only tissue I could find, and based on the fact that it was on my bedroom floor... I'm sure you could make your own conclusions...).&nbsp;</P>
<P>Today sucked major ass, and by sucked I don't mean the ""cute-sy"" sucked.&nbsp; I'm talking the all out, full blown (no pun nor extended metaphor intended), omg that bitch isn't wearing those pink shoes with those brown pants sucked.&nbsp; I think I would have had a better day bottoming for a cactus... mmm... bottoming.&nbsp; (Calling Dr. Freud... someones stuck in the Anal Stage).&nbsp; </P>
<P>Okay, so I leave my room with godspeed and hurry to the library to print out everything I need.&nbsp; The computer takes forever to load for some odd reason, so there is another fifteen minutes wasted.&nbsp; Moving once again at a little bit less than the speed of light, I bolt over to the classroom, and being a little late sit down to regain my awareness.&nbsp; Unfortunetly, I have to present first so I don't ascertain the chance for relief.&nbsp; Then it just gets worse.&nbsp; I presented all huffy and puffy.&nbsp; I felt like the Marlboro man after lung surgery.&nbsp; I couldn't even force myself to look at the audience, because the lack of oxygen sure was making me nervous.&nbsp; Maybe I should have taken Gramma's Thanksgiving present: a Xanax.&nbsp; Just kidding, but anyway, on a more serious note, I never felt like I wanted to cry after BGB's class. [Email me or IM me if you want to know what BGB stands for...]</P>
<P>Enough of that mess.&nbsp; Anyway, I received back an English essay today.&nbsp; I thought I wrote rather well (the subject was on the transcendence of love and its manifestation in literature), but that wasn't the case.&nbsp; When I looked on the back page of the essay I found the following: ""This paper should have ended 3 and a half paragraphs ago... C+).&nbsp; C+! C+!&nbsp; ... You'll shoot your eye out...(bad Christmas Story reference).&nbsp; I'm pretty sure I could have deficated, urinated, puked, spit on the paper, then rub it in and at least receive a B-.&nbsp; I've slowly come to terms with this, being more of a competive student, realizing that not all work will be good work.&nbsp; I just find the comment really funny.&nbsp; Funny, in a snide, cranky professor way.&nbsp; </P>
<P>So, after all this joy, I found myself sitting in the library letting my brain rot on AIM.&nbsp; God, I love AIM.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>"

"event","Ok.
I guess I am back writing in my livejournal again.  So.  Lets see.  It seems as if I never have any of value to write in here.

Well.

I am done with my first semester of college, and have managed to obtain a 3.9 GPA.  I have received a B+ in my honors writing class.  I really didnt care about that class much.  I didnt enjoy the way the teacher taught, and yah know.. all that jazz.  Oh well.  I got my schedule for the Spring 2003 semester and it isnt looking that bad at all!  

I have... Human Behaviors, Critical Thinking, 20th Century History, Chemistry and Biology.  17 credits of marvelous wonder.
Yay. Gotta love school, its what now, 55 dollars a class? Interesting.  
Lets do the time warp again!

Okay.

So over this break I am working at wendy's and it sucks major ass once again.  Thank god I shall not be working there this summer.  

I need a car. Badly. Very badly.

I feel the need to write very choppy. 

We can always play by ear, but thats the deal my dear.

Ah, Laura.  I havent seen Laura this entire break.  I miss her a lot.  Being busy is not fun.

Ah.  I guess my birthday is coming up! Whoppie friggin do!

I mean I never do anything spectacular on my birtday which blows fat anus.  but hey, maybe this year. 

My family is retarted.  My brother is an ass, and apparantely not much of a man.  Thank god for Chris (other brother) 

and Rachel, (sister) 

Grr.. ass... grrr

gets me pissed , moving on

Friends... friends lets see.... Update on friends here
College: Ehh dont talk to them that much over break
Twist: I love you guys.  A lot.
Chuck: *hugssss* amazing... wonderful.... *smiles*
Jason: Fucking amazing. That is simply all that can be said
AJ:  Awesome. Always there. Doing good
Nikki: my girl I love her, thank god shes coming back
Amber: My Grace. 
Regina: Busy w/ her boyfriend.  Pretty much pushing me on the sidelines.. oh well big deal.

Everyone else: Talk to in passing... bleh.... 

I wanna go back and do it all over, but I cant go back I know.


Oh well. I guess I am done for tonight.

"event","I have come to the point in my life where I am finding certain people cannot be trusted. I thought that going to college would help me meet new and exciting people, sure it did... until I found out more about these people. When you get down to it, all your doing is meeting different bodies.  The emotions and personalities are just the same. I mean one of everything has to come from a highschool, so it makes sense that you get the shitheads you were once so familiar with.  Let's just say that people can be idiots as well.  I dont understand how you can do something for someone and they can be a total bitch to you.  You know what dont worry, because things will get better and I will just screw the other people over when it comes time. That really angers me, but oh well I guess I should be used to it by now.  Ive learned that the only people I can trust is my close nit pack of friends at home, and Im not going to mention certain names of who i trust more, because certain people back home dont understand the meaning of keep it to yourself and only yourself.  Geez. Some people get that feeling like the half to tell someone, almost the same as if thye have to take a piss. I mean come on... I keep your secrets dont I? Perhaps a few need to fly? Well, Im not that kind of person and maybe you should be greatful for that.  There is only so much a person can take, and for the past 5 years Ive been taking quite a lot of shit from people.  Do you need a ride? Sure no problem. Help with that integral problem? Sure..... What about those labs, sure I can give you a hand...... ""Oh could I have a ride to work?"" ""No? But I ran my car into the ground picking you up at the mall and taking you places...and you cant even give me a ride to work this once?"" Wonderful. Muchly appreciated.

Another point. Lets let go of high school garbage. It is really starting to get on my nerves. I mean Im in college now, I dont need to hear about shit that happened 3 years ago. Its over. drop it.. move on.. whatever. 

Im pissed for now, but maybe Ill calm off in the near future.
Hopefully."

But anyway. Im still gay! :) 
(Laura would appreciate that right now)
But I am just having a very weird time up here in wilkes barre. I dont really know hot to explain it.  It is somewhat weird.

"event","Okay. Well I havent been here in a LONG time. 
Basically, I really havent had time since I started at the wonderful world of King's college.

Well. Lets bring you up to date. First of all, I like my new life up here. I mean I can do what I want when I want it.  It is the type of independence I always craved.  I mean Im not like a rebel, now I can drink all day kinda guy.  It just feels good not to worry about being home at a certain time on a Friday night.  I find that very cool.  Also, I quit Wendy's . There was certainly no way in hell that I was going to work there during college. My blood pressure was high enough. 

Okay.  Lets see. Love -wise... stinks. We wont even go there.

Class- classes are okay. I love chemistry, and Im probably changing my major from biology to chemistry.  Dr. Laduca is fucking awesome.  He is my favorite professor.  He is just one of those zany guyst that you have to like

Dr. Paoletti is really cool too.. LOL even tho he can be rather.. blunt

I like our FYE prof.  even though everyone things that she is a crack head.

Im also really really horny. But hey.. you didnt need to know that.
Check back lataz!"

As Mr. Edmondson would say... its crunch time.
And it really is.

Im leaving in a week. And sure i might only be going 30 miles away, but its still a change.
Nothing pissed me off more when people dont understand that. ERRR

""You only going 30 minutes away, nothing is changing""

Yeh okay. Thats some brilliant fucking deductive reasoning isnt it now.

Okay. 
Well im not really pissy, so Ill try to get out of this mode.

Well. Anyway I really have to get moving.  I have to read my required reading book, clean up, and pack.  I think i can manange to get it all taken care of tho

So anyway. Im headed to Wilkes Barre now. Im going to check the coming out store and see what they have to offer up there haha. This could be fun :0

Fear the book

Anyway, today I went out with Lenny and Jess.  Went to Applebee's. It was fun! Althought I did have to throw a very moldy chemistry book out the window. Go figure.  The indian guy was kinda scary at Dunkin Donuts,and I also met someone in pajamas. I want to make this short because Im kinda tired hahah.

Anyway everyone wish Phil good luck tomorrow with his job interview! I know he will do amazing!
Lots of Love,

I am so damn bored. Hah. 

Well, I just got home from my nephew's house. I gave him my old computer. I thought that was nice of me. 
:)
See I can be nice. 
OMG i so want to get out of this house.
Really really really really bad.
I cant take it anymore.
Anyway, I have to start reading my required book, Dear Exile.  This is going to be fun.  I think i gained some weight. Either that or I am extremely neurotic.

Darn.

I am so glad that I dont have work at Wendy's anymore, but now nobody ever wants to go out.. SURE! Yah wanna go out when I have work. Go figure.

:)
I think Ill just go to bed tonight. I mean. Why waste money.

I really miss Phil, a lot.  I dream about him almost every night.  He's sucha good guy.  I cant wait till i can see him again.

I need a car too. Really badly. 

Somebody please buy me one! hahah jk

O' Lord, wont u buy me.. a mercedes.. benzzzzz....

Wow. 

Well. I woke up today and realized that I only have 9 more days of summer to content with. Yay. What a joy.  

I want to leave, yet I dont.  Its scary.  I mean I feel psychologically ready to leave for college, but Im just worried for no appearant reason. Perhaps I dont want to leave home, or perhaps I will be scared being a minority in a new place.
I have no idea how my roomate will react to being gay, all I know is that purely and simply he is homophobic, and hates them.

Wow.  Gotta love matchmakers.

Exactly, where have all the cowboys gone?  I guess we will never know.

Today, is going to be another boring day.  I have to read my required book sooner or later. Preferibly later.

Um.  Thats about it for now. Nothing that special as of yet.  Maybe something will happen today? Ah, who the hell am I kidding....."

So
What did Ryan do today?

Bought an ethernet cable. Wow. The fun.  

Ive come to realize that people come into your life for a reason.  I thank god everyday that I was able to meet Phil.  He is such a sweetheart!  I realized that you do meet people for a reason, and even if they dont stay in your life they each donate something special to you.  For instance, lets consider just any nameless asshole that walked into my life.  It taught me that I do not have to put up with immaturety and petty shit! :)  

Ive been becoming more bold lately.  It's rather scary.  

Well, almost all of my friends know that I am gay.  Except Regina really and that group that I hang out with. I would love to tell her but for some reason.. I feel very weird about it.  I mean, its just one of those crazy feelings.  Ive still been dying to tell my mother. But it just seems as if Im not there. I mean she always complains and tells my sister that I do not talk to her or share a lot of my life with her, but it always seems as if its only at her conveinence. 

Oh well, maybe it is just me. I can get really bitchy sometimes.   As some of you guys know :)

Tomorrow, my neighbors wanted me to go get drunk with them. But im a good boy. :)

I still need to pack. Its sickening. I have so many clothes. 
Go figure. 

Anyway. I feel that this is sufficient. Check back later. Maybe Ill actually do something this week.

Today has begun with a bang! LOL. Yesterday was really funny.  Anyway, I stayed the weekend over Phil's house again. I had a wonderful time, just as always. Except something weird happened this time.  Appearantly, parents do not like it when you dont come home, or you dont let them know where you are for a day or so. Geez. Uptight :) hahah anyway thats all cleared up atleast. :) hahah  Yesterday, I also hung out with Laura and Phil .  We went to Damon's and I think i was almost killed. I had some kinda chicken tenders salad that made me extremely sick, and it was not pleasant especially in yesterday's heat. Hah.  I think im falling in love. Actually, I think I am in love. Its funny.  Its so strange to be gay because  you know its deviant, but it just feels so natural.  I am also contemplating on telling my friend Regina that Im gay, as well as my mother. I can't wait to see my mother's reaction.  I know she will be upset, but she is very open and accepting about gay people.  And she cannot use the ""no grandkids line"" because she already has tons of those thanks to my other ""breeding"" siblings.   Then, after that my dad will find out. HAHA wow. What a shock for him :) 

But we wont get into that now. Well lets see on my list to do today:
Shower
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing :)
Looks like a good day. 
Be back later w/ some updates."

I just woke up and it is very very cold.  Yuck.  I can't stand being cold for obvious reasons.  LOL.  It causes embarrassing things to happen if you know what I mean. Well, anyways, I have work tonight, but thank god it will be on of the last.  One more day and I will no longer be employed at the land of grease, aka Wendy's.  

Anyway, considering this is my first entry, maybe you should learn a bit about myself. Hah.  Okay so maybe that isn't such a great idea, but its okay I am not known to come up with wonderful plans at times.  :)  Well.  Im 18.   Im gorgeous.  LOL god no. but it felt good to say it.  I live in the stupidest town in the world, but we wont go into that.  Let's just say that if you have your Rusty Wallace t-shirt, sweatpants, and pumps, you'll be okay.  Moving on, I am going to college this fall! Yay! King's College to be exact.  Ah, colllege, the wonderful world of study and intellecutual people.  Oh my.   Let's see. I have brown hair and eyes and I weight about 164 lbs which is a triumph to someone who used to be 205 lbs.  O! Im a man too! And a darn good one! :) haha That just sounds so corny and poetic and all that good stuff.  

Okay, now where can I ramble.  I'm supposed to be talking about my day dammit, not painting the portrait of my life.  Well, anyway, who cares just listen.  Haha.  If you've ever met me, and god bless, then you know that I happen to be what you would call ""gay"".  Yes, I like boys.  Interesting... 

But its me, so deal with it :)  I have a beautiful boyfriend, his name is Phil.  I really like him a lot, and he is one of the sweetest guys I have ever met.  :)


Oh, anyway. You know the basics. So lets see.  Today just started, and I have to go to work at 4.  So when I get back, there will be some really good stories to tell.

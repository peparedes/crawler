Off by a couple grand.

Seeing Nicole was everything I needed. To see someone taking care of her and knowing that her and lucian is going to be ok makes me happy. I know I can't be that guy. So knowing someone is doing it makes me feel at ease.

I don't feel guilty anymore. I feel free.

Spending time with justine and family was everything i needed. I feel like i can take on the world again after just a weekend away. Family is def the only thing that can recharge me.

As for this girl. Idk. I need to stop worrying about that stuff.. there is no rush and I def don't need the complications of someone in a relationship."

It would of been something I would have been super excited for... Actually no... I am still super excited about it... Just not looking forward to seeing Nicole. Yeah, she'll be there.

On another note. I feel like i'm leaving something behind, something I'd rather be next to... But really what am i leaving behind? She isn't mine and even if she was single I'm not sure she'd be mine. I don't understand why I get attached to people. Idk if Im being lead on, but I can just tell when a girl is into me and she's showing all the signs. Or am I seeing what I want to see? Maybe a disruption from my week is good. Maybe running into Nicole again will be good. Maybe this is the weekend that will change my life?

I think it is because I've decided to stop writing my thoughts down. I have been so... embarrassed i guess to express what is on my mind. Maybe that is where art dies. When you no longer feel comfortable expressing yourself.

I've been so frustrated lately. Everything never seems to come together. People say things will come together, but damn, I don't ever get that. I might have already missed my time. Maybe my time has already passed?!

Ugh. I meet the most amazing girl and turns out I can't have her.
I need to not do what I usually, which is make a huge mess.

I need to stop making messes.
... well I think I've stopped for the most part.

And I find myself so bored.
being good is so boring.

what do I even want?

I'm gonna re-read some of this shit I wrote here because maybe I can laugh at myself some.

anyway.. whatever. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK.

... just let it out and be unfiltered i'm telling myself in my head right now. So what if these posts seem rambling.

Also.. Update.

I visited Nicole in april. It was awesome to see her. I was so happy.
It was weird being around her after so long.
I met her son.

My heart broke when she told me how everything is going.

Its not going well...

I LOVED that girl so much and to see her where she is. Breaks every bit of me.
Then I left.

I left because I was scared of getting involved.

A week later she told me we can't ever speak again.
... I tried to fight it, but she was being so cruel I just decided FUCK this. I will never have a feeling for this girl ever again.

And that's Nicole... Thats the closing chapter on that.

Another one of my friend's girlfriends likes me.
She's kissed me already... and other things.

FUCK.
why?

ugh.

I just want to be with someone who is available."

She is turning out to be so interesting and so much not like the person I pinned her down to be. 

It's been rather refreshing the time I've spent with her... The most interesting part is her acceptance of me. Seriously I already fucked this all up or thought I did by being a complete jack ass the other night. She still wants to hang out with me and seems genuinely interested in the person I am outside of being that complete jerk she already has seen me as. 

That's the worst of me. She's already seen it and yet she is still around. Nobody does that. So I'll be sweet and I'll be kind. Someone like her deserves to see the best of me."

"event","I had a moment today.

That moment slowly reached me and its still continuing to build even as I write this. I need to write it down before I lose it. Its this feeling of total clarity about my life and where its going. Where is it going? I don't know really, but for the first time I'm not worried about it. I'm looking forward to whatever is coming at me.

I worry too much. I try to predict and to plan ahead for things that don't happen. The truth is whatever does happen isn't what I expected and comes sooner than I expect. So why do I even bother? Its crazy.

Jansen (my best friend, i'm sure he's been mentioned many times in this thing) said something to me this weekend that just blew my mind... ""be with the girl that makes you like the person she brings out of you"". That... that is something I never thought about. I mean before we continue... this moment isn't about a girl... its about me being happy about my life... in general. You see, what he said set the stage, started a domino effect... A rock dropped into my philosophical pond causing a ripple which started a wake that built up into a wave that eventually drowned a butterfly flapping its wings.

I realized I'm over all this shit. So over it all. Over it in the sense that I'm cruising at 30,000 feet above looking down and realizing how inconsequential all these problems are. How I make things much bigger than they need to be. How I just don't care anymore whether or not someone feels a certain way about me. It doesn't matter because its all about the person I am becoming and whether or not I like that person. I noticed that I for the most part like who I am. That who I am has some work to do and that if I were to ever join forces with anyone... They need to bring out those better parts of me I am looking for.

I also realize that I've been living with some sort of mental haze. A haze that has been left behind by previous relationships and other people inserting themselves into my existence and me allowing them to affect me. Allowing them to bring out the parts of me I don't like and somehow accepting them as if its who I really am.

But its not. That guy that I hate... that guy isn't me.

I get to choose who I am. I control that. Not you. Me."

I spent the entire day with my little sister. We had a great conversation tonight that put the last 3 years into perspective for me. 

I'm afraid I continue to mess up relationships before I have the time to plant them in the ground. Sometimes things go so well and then I make my wrong move and I'm back to the start.

Something is definitely wrong with me. All in all in the last 3 years things got bad, then they got worse, and then they got better but still shitty.

This year I managed to care about someone. You could even say I started believing in love again. That all may have been premature. 

I have these feelings for someone and it scares the living shit out of me. I think I'd rather be alone for the next year than to ride a roller coaster of useless feelings. I'm not sure I even know what I'm doing anymore... Or how to treat a girl.

Just a little over 5 years ago we were sitting at the local Chinese buffet debating if we really wanted to do physics homework.

This week has been great and ended on a bit of a dramatic note at work. Its interesting when you are not agreeing with the direction a particular group of people are going regarding our relationship with a rather large client. Its important to own up to mistakes and key to communicate with a client to understand what it is that they truly need. These people in my company did neither and continued to try to push their idea for a solution to our client. I stepped in and said what needed to be said as an advocate for our client and ruffled some feathers."

"event","I lay here in my bed. Its been months now. Yet I am here thinking of her and just wanting her... on the phone. I miss her voice and the little things. I miss sharing findings of the day  with her. I miss her playing guitar for me.

... Its hard to think of these things when in the end she was never about me to begin with.

Its been a while since we spoke so I feel safe writing here. I doubt she's still checking up on me. I deleted my tumblr, we aren't friends on fb, I deleted our playlists, and I have no way of contacting her. So I'm thinking by now I should be ok.

I've started talking to other girls and with one in particular I am starting to see a potential. With her things are easy. We just pick a lot of random things to do and we do it. Its easy. During the week she does her thing and I do mine. We're busy people and its rather productive I think. She finds me on weekends and she's managed to make my Sunday's worth while.

Sundays is key. I'm really taking this one slowly. I broke a lot of rules with Sammy that I have for myself. This way i can minimize the risk of getting hurt.

I do miss Sammy though, but we know that that is it. I sent her an email a while ago and I haven't gotten a reply so.. That is that."

Tinker toy constructs
Disassembled, my ideas vs hers
A cam gear set to top dead center
Synced with pistons and a points distributor
Mending engines as our bridges burn
Wrenches turn, pieces come together
Conversations turn, circle, and drain
Who we are crumbles the harder we try
The engine turns over, a fire rages within
When the smoke clears there is the open road
The joy, the speed, and the freedom
Left with dirty nails and bloody knuckles 
I have only what I cannot fix
And she suffocates my satisfaction

Jokes on them... I've been awake. Staring at a phone that doesn't seem to work anymore. Every now and then she floods my mind. I smile when I think of her. I listen to our playlists because they are all I have left of her.

Now and then she pops onto my social media feeds and I wonder if it has anything to do with me. I read two poems of hers that she posted last night. They were really good. I've learned to stop assuming things are about me. If they are, gosh I wish she would just say those things to me... Instead she sits in silence while my mind goes deaf.

And though it hurt so much to see this come to an end. I couldn't keep letting her pull me in and push me away over and over again. So whatever her reasons are, that isn't what matters anymore. What matters is that this stops, at least for a while... and she has time to figure things out for herself.

I was asked long ago by someone, ""why do you love me?""
And the only answer I could think of was ""because you are so sure that you want to be with me"".

I remember thinking that was the worst answer ever to that question, but now that I think about it... Knowing who a person is to you is the difference between fighting for that person and just giving up.

I used to be so scared by that sureness... because quite honestly, I wasn't sure and I wasn't ready.

So how can I blame her for feeling how she feels when I felt the same way once.

Blame it on bad timing.

"event","It seems like lately that's all I hear. ""Be careful"".

At first I didn't really understand what anyone meant when they said that to me. I am careful... right? Then a friend said... ""You spent a good year and a half healing Karl... Be careful"".

Then I thought about that. The last year and a half. The pain I felt. The darkest days of my life. The feeling of isolation and abandonment. The feeling of paralysis.

She says she's scared. We are moving so fast. She still doesn't know what she wants. When I first heard that I wasn't even sure what she was talking about, but later on a drive I realized that the last month or so was a blur. 

At the time my body was running with an acute toxicity of jealousy running through my veins. I wanted the evening to myself which i got, but she was out with a friend (a guy) and the child inside of me wants to be the center of the universe. I am told that jealousy is a natural thing and the difference between good men and scumbags is how they deal with it.

I hate that feeling. I tell myself I'm not the jealous type because I don't indulge in the feelings of jealousy. It doesn't mean that they don't happen, but when I do feel it... I try to fall on trust.

I trust her. I know that I'm on her mind. She even called me during this drive to tell me she was thinking of me while she was still out with her friend. She melted my heart and made me feel so guilty for feeling any bit of that toxic jealousy.

At that moment I realized... I too am scared. I am scared because she already means so much to me. 

So I needed to be out. I met with a friend to hear about the things that have been bothering her. We went to target. I was there to pick up frames for the posters that Sammy... (oh yeah, her name is Sammy... still haven't introduced her on here. I guess I should, but then again I'm waiting... waiting for her to decide what I am to her... She has read through my old entries and says that I talk about girls a lot. I don't want her to be some LJ entry about a girl and that's it. I want to write more than just that about her. I want a story here.) 

... Anyway I'm sure writing inside a parenthesis that long is probably bad form or something... Anyway, Sammy got me a very awesome poster and also painted something for me. I wanted to frame them because they both deserve that kind of attention. When I went home I mounted the painting first. It looked great and I sent her a picture of it. I wanted her to see how much even a little expression of hers means to me... Her painting is beautiful and its now in a frame because that little expression of hers... moved me. She moves me.

She moves me so I need to be careful.

I need to be careful.

i need to be careful

i need to be careful

be careful

be careful

be care

be scared

I need to be scared. Right now we are on skype. She is sleeping and just so beautiful... I have this song playing on repeat. I wonder what's on her mind, what she is dreaming of. I wonder about her fears. I wonder if it is me she fears or if it is the uncertainty of what she thinks she wants vs what she really wants vs what she needs vs seeing the future presented in front of her and just wanting to take a pass.

And there it is... That last bit. That is what I should be scared of.

Being the right guy, but just not the guy for right now.

Sometimes not knowing what you want consistently is knowing exactly what you want.

I'm thinking too much. I hope this never gets read... and yet I post it. Knowing it will get read eventually.

She sleeps and she's stolen my heart.

Just Be Careful.
seems too late for all that now."

"event","There are only a couple songs out there where when heard I am reminded of exactly where and when I first heard it and the situation. This song came to me when I was sitting in the back seat of my buddy's S13 (240sx). We were just coming home from a show. 

It was him and his girlfriend. His sister was in another car behind us with the guy she eventually ended up marrying. He popped in a mix and this was the first song in the cd. I had the biggest crush on his sister. I was, before this year of high school, just a commoner in comparison to the royalty my buddy ran around with. My buddy was just your average punk who through his antics found himself in the popular circles and was dating one of the hottest girls in school. His sister was just a freshman that year and I, I was a sophomore. Already she had the attention from the senior guys and was on the dance team.

This was my year! My family just moved into this nice big beautiful house. It was 2700 square feet with a modest 10,000 gallon pool in the back. Almost twice the size of the house I grew up in and in a much nicer neighborhood that popular kids could respect. This was my year of re-invention... I did just that.

I never cared to be popular... I just wanted to be noticed by girls and to be respected by this group of kids that seemed to have it all. I forced myself to be more social. I went to parties. I drank and participated in the shenanigans that made my group of friends noticed. I took chances with girls, made mistakes, anything that could give me some more experience. In hopes that when I had the chance I'd take my new skills and make the moves on the right girl.

She was the right girl or at least at the time I was convinced of it. Problem was... she never noticed me. I was over at their house numerous times. To her I was just her brother's friend... just another punk kid playing guitar for a garage band. 

So anyway... there I was, sitting in the back seat of this 240sx. Chris's voice came out of the speakers and my entire life was changed. Staring out of the rear window I could see the headlights of the car behind us. I could see her face. She was just so entertained, laughing, and just taking my breath away. I turned around and slumped in my seat. I knew this was the closest I'll ever be to her.

---- Fast forward 12 years ---

So i guess you are wondering why am I telling you all of this. Well... tonight was the closest feeling I've had to that feeling I had 12 years ago. Just knowing that no matter what accomplishments I've made to improve my position in life over the past few years... I am faced looking at a woman I could never be with. Just as it was in high school... I'm only close enough to be 1 degree of separation.

The difference between then and now. I know better than to get stuck. 
So with that... NEXT!"

You know who you are. I'm sure everyone who had a chance to read this knows who you are. Its been a year and yet you still linger in my mind. I still long for you, as if you've stepped out and you'll be home shortly. So much has happened in my life in the last year, so many experience, so much good times, and a bit of some bad. I no longer have context of you, but what lingers is a memory of what was, outside of my complaints and stresses, probably the best moments of my life. I'm afraid to even speak to you. I'm afraid of what you're doing or worst yet who... I try hard daily to destroy the pieces of you that are left, but even if the physical evidence is gone you still haunt me. I wouldn't know what to talk about with you if I saw or heard from you. In the end I'm still hurt... Not just because you hurt me, but because I dropped the ball too.

And now all that's left is this empty state... A void that never gets filled where I pour my anger into, like oil into a lake, as I am reminded who crossed the line... It was you."

They were problems that I myself could have avoided but didn't pay enough attention to the details and fell into it. We eventually fixed the issues and production can continue tomorrow.

I went to A.A. today. It was encouraging to meet people who have the same difficulty as I do and working through it. It astounds me when someone says they are a year sober. I could barely go a month. I hope to make this change and do it well."

Today I decided to take my problem seriously. I need to stop drinking all together. I need to attend A.A. and I need to find meaning in my existence. I need to connect with my spiritual side and live a balanced life. I met up with an old friend who I've known since college. He moved here a while ago and I feel blessed that he is here to support me as I take these steps. We're all rough around the edges. We all have our problems and it takes a support group to overcome.

I prayed a lot today. I asked God for strength to get through this. I asked for help... because I know I am so weak against this problem."

"event","Yesterday marked 1 years since Nicole left.

I remember being in the departures ramp at MSP getting her bag out of the car... I hugged her and kissed her... and as I drove off I looked back and saw her start to cry.

This is the last time I saw her. Every part of me wanted to tell her NO STAY... but I didn't. A lot of things has happened since that day. Us breaking up... her hooking up with another guy... Then her starting up a relationship with another guy who eventually abused her.

This last year has been difficult. Difficult because I knew this wasn't the right thing. Difficult because I know now that if you love something you'll have to work hard at making things work. Money is just money. Difficult because even if I know this now things probably still wouldn't work out.

I still miss her. I still wish that none of this ever happened. The truth is, the girl I loved is not there anymore. That girl became something else... something I cannot love. She broke my heart more than once. There are days when I want her to just be here. I dream about her still being here. These are all fantasy and dreams.

Someday I'll meet the right one. Until then I need to really take care of some things.

I need to take not drinking seriously. I feel like alcohol is a bad relationship. If you are in a bad relationship you need to keep away from it. Alcohol is a bad relationship with me because it eventually destroys my good judgement. It destroys the upstanding citizen I am and brings me down to the status of a simple criminal. A relationship like this cannot continue. Even a small drink is like flirting. I cannot allow myself to be pulled in. 

There is parallelism between alcohol and yesterday's anniversary day."

He seems like a pretty cool guy and I can tell I can get along well with him. We all including one of his wife's friends went out tonight go get a Jucy Lucy at 5-8 club. A Jucy Lucy is a burger that has cheese inside of it... there is a rivalry over who first created it between 5-8 club and Matt's Pub.

I now know 3 couples here in my complex. Across the hall, my buddy phin and his girlfriend, and now these guys. I know of another couple that lives in my building as well but I never connected well with the dude. Funny how when I was in a relationship all I wanted was to have friends who were couples, but had a hard time finding them. Now I'm single most of my friends are couples.

Today was encouraging. Making new friends without feeling like I had to try so hard... it just happened."

"event","As I'm sitting here waiting for my project to update it just seems like that's all i'm doing lately. Waiting...

Waiting for:
results
something to happen
losing something
gaining something
feeling of being alone to end.

Patience is something I really have to work hard at and I just fail miserably.

I started watching a show again that I thought I couldn't because of its association. I'm glad that I can, I feel just that little more normal. My dreams lately have been haunting. I keep dreaming as if this past year never happened and she is still in my life. When I see her I am so happy... but that is just momentarily in a dream, but when I realize I am dreaming... I remember all the things that have led up to the present and I find myself in a place between acceptance and anger. The dreams have helped though. It helped me admit that yes she was one of the best things that ever happened to me. It also has helped me to understand that there has been decisions made that broke all of that and that there is no turning back.

And in the mean time... I wait... I wait until I can move on to the next thing.

I've learned that the next thing can't be a car... 
I've learned that the next thing can't be another relationship...

What I've learned is the next thing is in fact... Taking care of myself.
Living a life I can be proud of.
Just simply living a life.
My life.
Under my terms.
My mistakes are my own.
My actions are my own."

Talked to a alcohol assessment councilor. I feel like maybe there might be a chance there could be something wrong with me. The guy told me I was ok. I left him some references to talk to and I was told by references that the councilor was actually quite impressed by me and my story. I take chances... I've made mistakes... I repeat those mistakes, but life is about learning.

Work was great today. I am constantly reminded by co-workers and clients that I am a hard worker and my work ethic pays off. I feel like my peers respect me.

We didn't do our normal Max Out Monday. I joke around and call our group of gym goers ""Sons Of MOM"". So instead I went home and did some extra work. I was tired because last night I read all my previous journal entries... They really put into perspective my life as I read about the things that used to bother me... How tiny and insignificant they were now, but were so new and huge to me then. I worried too much about girls. I let what other people think of me effect how I thought of myself. I don't feel like not much has changed since then, kind of really the same guy. With that perspective gained though, I see what I can do to change and make things better.

There are a lot of attractive women I work with. Its hard sometimes to stay focus. I plan on really trying my best to get to know them. I suppose something my ex said to me rings true in my ears and I know I need to work on it... she said, ""You treat me like an accessory"". I have been thinking about that for a year now. Do I objectify women as such that when I have someone... they are just simply an accessory for me? As if my love for her is no different than the love I have for my car.

Sadly that all could be true. On the other hand I wonder if it is a level of respect she never obtained from me... I never saw her as an equal and I am not sure I've ever thought of a girl as my equal. I think I feel threatened by that thought.

Anyway. The gym was good today. I feel like I could burn some more fat, but I feel very fit. I look at the mirror and I see a handsome person. I haven't felt that way in almost 2 years.

i'm gonna try this out for a shot... end this entry with...

"event","Wow...

I don't even know where to begin. I am listening to Postal Services' 10 year Edition. I've had this account for 10 years! I had my eyes closed ready to go to sleep and I decided tonight I'd listen to some Postal Service... You Live Journal and Postal Service came into my life around the same time. I realized tonight that I haven't been doing anything to record my thoughts or ideas since Nicole and I broke up. In fact I erased my Tumblr which I guess had my thoughts and ideas in it. Its funny the last entry in this account was about Allison. You've missed 4 years of my life. So much has changed. I left SUFS and started working for this place called the Nerdery... I met a girl who I thought was the answer to my questions about love, but like all things in my life I find a way to mess things up or take for granted a good thing. In this case I did both and well I can't go back and change what has happened. It was a good run with Nicole. First girl to live with me and even move all the way to Minnesota where I now live. Long story short, in the last four years I've been working hard on this software development thing. Its working out pretty well and just like before with Allison things moved way too fast for my personal life to keep up with and a relationship suffered again.

Anyway, the postal service album reminded me today of being in North Carolina 10 years ago. It was a great time with my closest friends and family. I cut it short though because I wanted to come home and spend what I want to say was some reason for fireworks... I want to say it was forth of july? But at the same time I feel like it was winter time? I'm not sure but I came home because I wanted to spend time with Staci. I guess that there is something to say about that and how whatever this feeling is I have now will pass. I've loved and lost before. I'm not ready to love again until I really truly have my priorities straight. I need to find balance. 

This weekend felt balanced. For the first time since I moved to Minnesota, I had what felt like a group of friends just wanting my time and it felt great. I didnt get a chance to get any of my car projects done, but that stuff can wait because I've learned to just allow things like friendships to happen. Not force them, but take in the opportunities to create and re-enforce them."

So here we are again... back to the same routine. I've been here before. I honestly thought she would be different. I honestly believed that that one big question in my life was answered. Its upsetting to see that this one is no different... that I'm ""back to the drawing board"". 

I won't allow myself to continue acting like a fool. I need to remind myself that yes this is over and you have done all you can to get her back. She made her choice. She knows what she wants and it just isn't me.

I hope to just be over it.

its been quite some time. no matter how long I seem to neglect you i find myself writing to you. It could quite possibly be because I forgot my password to my xanga.

I wish I would have been able to sit here and tell you about the last year of my life. There were so many amazing things and at the same time so many bad.

How much or rather how little I understand about Love... Seems like over the years the only thing we learn more about is the amount we don't know.

this is so funny to me because. I don't think I sound any different than that kid who wrote to you when he was 16.

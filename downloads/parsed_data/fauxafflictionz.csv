"event","So apparently Ryan and his mom got onto the subject of marriage yesterday. And she was telling him how much she likes me and asked how things were going with us.  He told her that ha didn't see himself breaking up with me anytime soon.  Then she proceeded to say that maybe I could be ""the one"".
And of course he didn't want to tell me any of this at first because men are such commitment-phobes, so I had to prod it out of him. And because he thinks that talking about the future or getting your hopes up will only result in disappointment. Not to mention, he has a really big fear of marriage because he's ""seen what it does to people."" Well, I have too. And for a while, I thought marriage and serious relationships were a bunch of depressing BS. But look where I wound up.
But anyways, I melted inside like butter when he said it. Because I wanted to hear it so much, because that's exactly what I've been thinking lately. I could see myself spending my life with him. And trust me, I'm knocking on wood so that I don't jynx myself just by talking or thinking about it.
Call me crazy, that's fine, I'm pretty sure I am. But right now, this is how I feel.
I think I'm going to take him to meet my dad and my stepmom this weekend. It's too weird to think that I've been dating him for almost 3 months and he hasn't met my father. So I've decided to go ahead and get that out of the way, soon."

Because there were so many things about you,
That reminded me of myself.
Things that I saw in you,
And only you.

This isn't the end of story,
It's the start of a chapter.
We aren't here to look for ourselves,
If we were,
Then I've succeeded by finding myself in you.

I'll think of you everytime I'm in the park,
That we've both fallen in love with.
Everytime I walk by the lake,
Where I walked with you.
Everytime I walk through the wet grass at night,
Without my shoes or a care in the world,
Because it's my fondest memory of you.

I'll think of you everytime I hear that song,
The one you sang to me.
Everytime I play guitar,
Because that's what brought me to you that first night.
Everytime I go into a music store,
Because of the memories they'll hold.

So fear not, dear friend.
I promise, you'll not be forgotten.
For we are not moving apart, only forwards.
Though not on the same path, but similar parallels.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've just spent the last two hours in your room.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting on your bed with you learning guitar.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spent more than half of the time talking about stuff.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've never enjoyed <i>just talking</i> with somebody, the way I do with you.
<b>The moon is beautiful and the night air is fresh and chilly.</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're talking about the moon having sidburns.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparing it to President Lincoln.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And looking for that scar on your arm.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm supposed to be home soon, but <i>I don't want to leave</i>.
<b>I stand there and wonder how you're not freezing.</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm in jeans and long sleeves and I'm starting to <i>shivver</i>.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're in a t-shirt and cargo pants with flip flops.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see your breath when you talk.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's amazingly nice weather though.
<b>I should have parked farther away--would've made for a longer walk.</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're slowly making our way towards my car, and I don't want to go.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made a comment about the P.O.S.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Oldsmobiles as muscles?</i> I could've sworn you were joking around.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally found the scar on your arm.
<b>I check the time--I'm supposed to be home in 5 minutes.</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we're standing beside my car.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're still talking, with no desire to stop.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I <i>can't</i> get grounded--I won't be able to hang out if I do.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell you how late it is and you read my mind.
<b>I would've stayed longer if I could have.</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We face each other to say 'goodnight'.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was thinking about how crappy I look with no make-up on and my hair a mess.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidently <i>you didn't notice</i>.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We turned to hug each other goodbye.
<b>I could've melted there in your arms.</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your hugs are amazing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You pulled my body against yours.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Held me tightly.</i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And slowly you let go.
<b>Our eyes met and locked as our faces neared.</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Everything slowed down</i> like a scene from a movie.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I traced your face from your eyes to your mouth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could feel your warm breath on my lips.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I closed my eyes.
<b>And then our lips met.</b>"

"event","You wake up to your alarm clock.
Five years from where you are right now.
You roll over and hit the snooze button.
<i>Nine minutes 'til it goes off again.</i>

You roll back over and there he is.
The same man you've been with for the last 4 and a half years.

<i>Everything you've ever wanted.</i>
You know that you're going to spend the next nine minutes, laying there with him.
You wake up every morning and hope he's still asleep; so you can watch him.
Slowly, you move closer to him so that you're resting your head on his shoulder and fitting your body into the small nook next to him.
You can hear his heart beat.
You can hear his every breath.
<i>What would you do without him?</i>
He's helped you so much.
You've helped each other through a lot over the years.

<i>You've always loved the way your skin contrasts his.</i>
His dark, muscular body against your creamy, delicate body.

As you lay there, you think of the first time he held you in his arms.
The first time you knew you always wanted it to be like this.
All those years ago, and he still manages to make you weak in the knees.
He still manages to take your breath away.
<i>He's still amazing.</i>

You're laying across his chest now.
Your head is turned so your ear is against his warm body and you're facing his face.
<i>Your alarm goes off again.</i>
This is his cue to wake up.
You lay there and wait for him to finally wake up.
After waking up so many times to this familiar sight, he doesn't even have to open his eyes to find your face.
He reaches his arms up your body and brings you in, closer to him.

You move slowly and carefully.
You're on top of him now and looking face-to-face with him.
He smiles and whispers, ""<i>Good morning.</i>"" Gently smiling to you.
You can't help but smile back and repeat the line, ""<i>Good morning</i>.""
Your lips meet.
Just like the first time, you still get butterflies in your stomach.

You stare back into his beautiful brown eyes.
""<i>I love you.</i>"""

"event","Alright guys.
This is just a brief introduction - even though all of you know me already.

From time to time I like writing little romance exerpts. I don't know where they come from, they just come. This is all going to be public, so you're more than welcome to read along. If you like something, I'd love it if you passed it along.

And like I said on my profile; I love to get feedback. I really encourage commenting. Even if you want to do it anonymously.

Soo... here goes. =]"

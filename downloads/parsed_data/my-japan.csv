"event","So my last basketball practice was well...eventful i guess :) I cried alot and so did Yuki senpai.  Aya and Hiroe and everyone i will miss so much.  i can`t even start to tell you how much i will miss them all...everyone.  They gave me a giant pluto and card things that they have all signed.  As soon as i get home i will tidy my room for the first day and then go for a run.  Then call people i guess.  Just thinking about everyothing i have to do i want to cry.  I mean i am going to have to do all the school thing again, an extra year at school and everything.  How am i going to do it?  I mean i have gotten so used to all of this.  Going back will be so hard.  I can`T believe it`S over.  For now atleast.

I have so much work to do but i will definately try my hardest.  I miss my basketball people and my senpai, i am ready to say goodbye to the JESEP people i like them, they`re all nice but i want to be around people i have known for a while lol.

Today we had to give a final speech to everyone.  I can`t believe its over.  (I need sleep so...)

"event","Today was second to last basketball practice... :(  tomorrow being the last, if i survive tomorrow i don`t have too many issues about coming home.  Anway...so have you ever like just spent time staring at yourself.  It happens alot here, i mean i don`t understand everything so often i drift of and suddenly my hands are really interessting and all the muscles n stuff it`s like wow.  Believe me if there was anything else to do i would.  SO in Basketball today we had a meeting, the teacher started talking (i`d like to pint out that AYa actually fell asleep) and i was looking at my legs and then i realised something...they have muscle now!  I was just like oh!  That wasn`t there before lol.  Honestly my legs have some kind of musculature now.  Even a muscle i never knew existed.  Wierd...There are also a wierd set of muscles either side of like your stomach that when you lean to one side appear.  I never noticed them before either....wierd!  Scales told me i was down 7 kilos in total yesterday....must be broken!  Lol

"event","SO yeah....the title sums up what my entry will consist of but also think i will briefly record what i`ve been up to:

23rd December : last day at ORHS
24th December : 37th ALL JAPAN WINTER CUP (basketball)  after took purikura with senpai, Aya asked me if i normally wear make up to which i replied no, she then goes, me neither, we`re already cute we don`T need it.  To which Haruka turns around and goes no Sophie`S cute, Aya pig.  Lol.  Poor Aya...she laughed and then followed the usual crazy girl dialogue.
25th December : 5am parents rang to wish happy xmas, 8am - 5pm basketball practice, got present from Aya, pig kewpie phone strao (chou kawaii!), got xmas card from Yuki (snoopy), almost missed bus back to Kumagaya, managed to get on it half dressed Hiroe and Aya almost killed themselves laughing.  I was sat on the floor of the bus changing out of my basketball clothes, it was after i`d changed that they told me the seat i thought had been occupied was empty lol, they laughed some more as did i, there was also alot of me being called kawaii (not unusual but unlike alot of others Hiroe and Aya seem to mean it lol.
26th : basketball full day practice at Otsuma, afterwards xchnanged mail addresses with Hiroe and Aya.  Hiroe told me she loved me.
27th : travelled with Hiroe and Aya to kawagoe for basketball match, Hiroe told me she loved me again, took train back with Hiroe and Aya, felt i really got close to them.
28th : basketball match in Ota (Gunma ken) ate very nice o-bento was my last away match with them which was nice because it was the same place as my first  away match with them.
29th : basketball mtach at Otsuma with over 9 chuugakusei teams competing in tournament.  Realised onlty have 2 more basketball practices left :(
30th : Disney Land Tokyo really really crazy crowded.  Bought to much...stayed overnight at the Sheraton with Kayo, Rika and Saki.
31st : Tokyo Disney Sea, much better than 30th, less crowded, went on loads of rides, lots of fun.  Bought too much again.  Evening went to stay at Kayos and visited temple on new years day.
1st Januray 2007 : slept until 1pm after all the busy days n travelling was dead, the longest lie in i have EVER had!  Then ate traditional food and was dressed in a kimono by Kayo`s grandmother.  
2nd : went to Ginza and ate at a restaurant called Ginto, it`s moto thingy was a silver rabbit very cute.  Ginza really impressive.  Station - Yuurakuchou

So yeah tomorrow i am packing and buying presents, 4th Basketball, 5th last basketball :( , 6th leave host family and head for kyoto, 7th kyoto, 8th travel back to Tokyo, 9th Tokyo, 10th travel back to England....

Am going to be busy and before i know it i will wake up in my own bed and this will all seem like a distant dream :(

Will really try to enjoy it though.....i mean there is no point being misetbale on my last days otherwise i will be a bit of a fool ne?

Love you,
Sophie

"event","Have you ever felt so wholey accepted by people that you can`t even explain it?  Have you ever been clapped and supported by a sportshall full of people who don`t really know you but wish you the best regardless?  Have you ever felt so overwhelmed by the kindness and generosity and never ending patience of the people around you that you wish you could stay and never have to leave?

When i came here, i couldn`t have imgained how it would change me.  I have been so accepted by people here, more than i ever was in Eng;and and there are more diffeernces between me and them, and the language barrier and everything....it`s just...remarkable.  I feel so much more of a person now, like i`m allowed to be me, just the way i am, and that i don`t need to change in order for people to accept me.  That if people have a problem with me it`s their issue not mine.

I wish i could thank all of these people here.  They have truely taught me so many valuable things about life and people.  I would trust them completely, with everything.

"event","Hey all,

I really dont think i want to come home.  I love it too much here, i mean it`s a really easy life here.  I got to see my dad, he came out for two weeks which was really nice.  Kinda wierd though cause i haven`t seen anyone i knew from before this since i came out here.  


Japan is good :)  You know i ran 3km in 17 minutes yesterday.  Are you proud of me?   Hehehehehehe.  Definately alot fitter than i used to be and i`ve lost 5 kilos, how good is that?!  I hope you`ll all be amazed when i come back lol, (joke)  I`ll just be happy to have you all to talk to again, by phone or whatever lol.  Email although i have all the faith in the world in it, i`m living off it here, can`t tell you if a person has read it or if someone doesn`t get it lol.  Where as ringing if the person doesn`t pick up lol, then you know they`re out or avoiding you (maybe in the bath).

I have to do a test on maths which was taught to me in Japanese!  Hannah can u remember when we used to be in Maths together.  i couldn`t do Maths then!  Let alome now and in Japanese.  HELP!!!!!!!!!!  It`s something to do with Vectors but that is all i can tell you.  Also have to right an 800 character essay in japanese about the differences between Japan and England.  Lol.  Should be fun opnly have 432 characters and it`s like in 2 days time that i have to do it.  HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What am i gonna do all the squiggly lines make no sense.  It`s all pictures to me....

Love you ALL

Finally only 2 days to go, i travel down to London Heathrow tomorrow and then i fly on saturday!  I may leave a final update tomorrow, before i leave but if not this will be my last update until i'm in Japan where if i'm lucky i'll be able to update although probably not for a week or so.  I still don't have a suitcase but...i have started packing.  The wrong order you may say, i say otherwise :P  

Got AS exam results today and got an AABD result the D was in French, a little bit shicked about that but worse things happen at sea i guess.  So today went to Hannah's and cooked and ate with Hannah and David was alot of fun and nice to see you before i go away.  Well done Amz for your results i hope things aren't tooooo stressful, i suppose a large amount of the stress is gone now.  Have a great time on holiday, even if every minute is filled with something you have to do.  Thank you Steph so much for my pressies, i love the cow!!!!  Brilliant!!!  

So tonight is my last night at home in the house as tomorrow am in Mariott hotel, don't know even if i spellt that right.  But....it's all good.  :P  I like the name, so yeah...

"event","Good morning all ^_^

Today leaves me with three days in this country and it still hasn't sunk in.  I wish it would already, because it would make being excited/scared a little bit easier if i believed that this is actually going to happen.  I've even collected my yen but still haven't had that rushy omg type feeling.  You'll be glad to know that the weather here seems much brighter although it doesn't feel much warmer it's nice to look out of my bedroom window and see sunshine.  Makes me smile.

Unfortunately today something that won't make me smile is the dentist who wants to stick needles in me which is fine, i can deak with that i just can't wait until it's over.  I've needed ot doing for a while so really this is for my own well being but does it have to involve needles?  Dentist says yes, i would like to say no but am not in a position to argue with a dentist who is holding the needle.

Now video blogging, there is a small possibility that i could, by using my digital camera create a video blog on youtube and record things maybe once a week, perhaps more if anything interesting happens, and then upload them all for you to see.  So you never know, i will let you all know if this becomes a reality.  The down side is that it would involve me broadcasting myself across the internet, the upside being that hopefully no-one other than those i tell about it will know.  So it's kind of a double edged sword or whatever.

Yesterday went on quite a large shopping spree with mum and also realised that yesterday was the day that Kim goes on holiday, so have a great time with that.  As for the shopping i have bought so much that i am beginning to wonder where it is all going to go in my suitcase.  It is a dilema that i hope i can resolve, and also one that would require a suitcase, and as i don't have one yet i'm going to give up on the owrrying about that for the moment.  I have the cutest set of pyjamas to take with me that the world has ever seen, they make you want to squeak with joy everytime you look at them.  Such is the power of these pjs.  Also got quite alot of casual/formal clothes so i won't look like a gaijin scruff that i am. 

So three days left....

Love you

"event","Hey all,

I've got one week left in this country. It's still hard to believe that in 8 days time i'll be landing in Tokyo after a long flight at about mid day their time.  It was really good seeing various people at Amz's mum's wedding and it was a really great evening ^_^  As for other things going on in my world at the moment.  Tomorrow is my last day at Chatsworth.  It's wierd because for ages it seemed like it was such a long time away.  But suddenly these last few days have flown by like nobody's business.  Will have to find all the random bits of uniform i need to take back.  

Exam result day is this thursday and i've got butterflies just thinking about it.  I tried really hard so i suppose that's really the only thing you can do at the end of the day.  I can't do anything to change the result now. Just hope and pray i guess.  Not that that can change much either to be honest.  So...I've seen kim n amy for the last time before i leave, unless i see amy at results day.  I probably will.  Hannah i'm hoping to see you sometime next week if possible as far as time is concerned on both sides.  Errr..... hopefully going to get the yen ordered that i'll be taking with me until i manage to get the bank account set up.  Probably going to take three weeks worth of money to survive off and then have the rest transferred into my account out there.  Fingers crossed.  I hope the bank account gets set up relatively quickly otherwise i'll be stuck.  Will have to email Miyuki as to how quickly that can be done.  

Got the dentist this wednesday, i cannot forget that otherwise i'll be really quite stuck.  I also have got to make lists of things that i'll be taking with me.  Will do that now.  

Love you all

What can i say other than, it's been pretty hectic i've been to somerset, sorted out school, still have to send off insurance stuff, must do that or i'll be in trouble.  No information about visa, gah!!!, still know nothing about host family but...that's not so worrying.  I am disorganised and i can't actually walk on my bedroom floor as there is just soooooooo much stuff on it. 
'tis dreadful!!!!

Still haven't seen tokyo drift lol, maybe will, but there seems to only be one showing a day at one time which makes things a little difficult but perservation is the key i am sure!!!!

So...next week will be the last cyfa, two weeks later my last day at work (omg!!!) then a 6 days after that i am off to the land of sushi, chopsticks and very large men dressed in nappies, also recognisable as sumo wrestlers.  I still can't believe it, i hope i like it or i'm kinda in trouble!!!

Anyhow...will tidy room (groan)

Unfortunately this is only in Japanese and there is no english page, which is probably a lil frightening cause it suggests they dont speak all that much english.  Lol, at least i'll learn.

It's an all girls high school (good/bad) and the uniform looks really quite 'kawaii', i'll be looked after by the vice-principal which i've been told is really quite an honour as no of the scholars are being looked after by anyone this 'influential' and this means they are taking me seriously which i am told is a good thing...lol.

"event","On the 19th June 2006 i got the reults to my application for a scholarship with the Japanese Embassy.  This involed spending 6 months in Japan living with a host family and attending school there.  To my shock and suprise i was accepted.  I wish i could explain how it felt, it was like i dunno, amazing, this is going to change my life in sooooo many ways.  It's going to get my career on the go, i'll get into Uni and most importantly i get to go to the country that i love.

Unfortunately there is another side, i'm leaving beind all my great friends and family who i love so much, no doubt i'll have contact with them all,well all bar one who doesn't want to which is fair enough really.  So that's the down side.  I'm worried that when i come back it'll be really wierd, and that people won't like me anymore or will have replaced me, which sounds silly, i guess i'm just paranoid/insecure lol.  Pathetic huh?

So anyway this is where the new journal comes in, i thought i'd create it so that anyone who wants to read it can and also so that those who'd rather not know don't have to lol, it's simple.  And alot quicker than telling people all about it in letters, although i'm gonna write alot of letters anyway!  Mainly because it's nice to get letters isn't it?

Now all i have to do is sort out what i am going to do about school n stuff, that's the complicated bit.  I'm hopefully having a meeting with the head of year and also with my mum to sort it out soon.  I suspect i will also have to have a meeting with my teachers, or heads of the department of subjects i study.  So yeah :P

Anyhow i'll keep you posted:

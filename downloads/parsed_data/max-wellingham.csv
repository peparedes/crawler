"event","Has anybody heard of Neways?  www.neways.com

I've been in contact with them recently with regards to an employment possiblity - becoming one  of their national distributors.  People have made millions from it - working on a similar concept to Avon (the wonderful cosmetics company), or (a little more similarly) Amway, the (margianlly nicer) cleaning products people.  The chap on the 'phone said it wasn't at all to do with sales, but the informative DVD he sent me didn't give that impression AT all!!!

I'm intruiged - how can you make money from profit on products that you've convinced people to buy, and it not be selling?!  The other way people make money is by building a vast ""organisation,"" network of distributors that yuo've recruited, and that other people have recruited - and you get commission from THEIr sales.  SO, for example - if i recruit 2 people, and each of those recruit 5, i recieve the commission from 12 representatives - and so on.  But it's still convincing people to ""buy"" a job.  Or relying on people being passed my name.  And the other thing!  i live in Parkstone!  grotty place where people would sooner swallow bleach than spend lots of money on additive free products!"

"event","For those of you who have not yet awoken, BB7 started 5 days ago.  And it's going surprisingly well, from the hosuemates' point of view - they all love each other, get on well, and Big Brother's attempts at dividing them is bringing them together; they're working together well, sharing, and supporting each other.

With the exception of possibly the most annoying man in the WORLD.  No, I lie.  He's worse than annoying.  He sepent this evening saying he wanted to go back to his own little world, back to his council house, where he spent his time in solitary confinement becuase he didnt' have any friends.  And watching thew ay he behaved just now, is it any WONDER?!  He realy upset Lisa, by calling her an imbecile (because the rest of the group didn't stop what they were doing to look at him while he was reading slowly, letter by letter).  But anyway, they decided that as he'd upset everyone so much they were going to discount himf rom the group, which I think is understandable.  And in payback, he went and took ALL the foodstuffs, and chucked them in a box in the garden.  Yeh - becuase that's going to make htem like you isn't it, you fucking cunt?!

he calls himself a ""paki poof,"" and blames his behaviour on that.  As Dawn pointed out to him, that's no excuse for his beahviour.  I think she tookt he wrong approach though, instead of talking to him as an equal, she needed to talk down to him, like a child.  As he does with the rest of the group.  the way he talks to the ret of the group shows that he's still mentally got the maturity of a 6 year old. ANYWAY, I know other ""paki poofs,"" as he describes them, who behave impeccabley.  i've seen better behaved creatures at the ZOO.  Now, for my suggestion.

I reckon, if we (the We-Hate-Shabhaz-Gruop, and i'm sure it's oigng to be HUGE) all put in a couple of quid, we should have enough to hire a helicopter.  We hover over the BB hosue in it, and when SHabhaz comes into the garden, we SHOOT him with a rifle.  Not a pussy air-rifle, but a proper heavy duty one like you'd use to kill a rhino or some other more intelligent beast.

Who's with me?!"

"event","Wow!  Once again, pointless web browsing has prompted me to post ramblinbs.  But fab ones!

http://www.familyfriendlychurches.org.uk/midihymns/HP352.MID

See if you can pick out the well known, seasoonal (although it's out of season atm,) hymn tune.  These are backing tracks for people to use in church.  Now i hate ""happy clappy"" hymns, and music groups drive me insane (i think it's the mix of 3 8 year old violinists, the old lady at the piano, the flute player, the little boy on the drum kit sounding over everybody else, the sunday shcool with their tambourines, etc.) But THIS, traditional hymns done liek this?  I love it!  mind you, i have a hting for heavy electronica (my CD collection of things like erasure, client, pet shop boys says it all really)

http://www.familyfriendlychurches.org.uk/midihymns/HP452.MID
http://www.familyfriendlychurches.org.uk/midihymns/HP528.MID
http://www.familyfriendlychurches.org.uk/midihymns/HP409.MID


Blessed assurance sounds decidedly parisienne.  And there's this yapping dog sample they keep using (i think it's part of percussion set, supposed to sound like deck scratching or whatever it is they call it).

And i'll leave you with this, i just liked the name of the tune: http://www.familyfriendlychurches.org.uk/midihymns/HP722.MID - ARMAGEDDON

I can't remember what the tunes are now, but i know one of them was aberystwyth, one was great is we plough the fields, and i can't remember the third!  But anyway!  Enjoy.  this is what hymns should be like!"

"event","I have just had the most amusing hour Ever.  Slightly sad, I know, but.  I found a website on Baragami (the welsh art of toast arranging, http://www.messybeast.com/baragami/baragami.htm)

The toast arranging is silly, but there's some interesting suggestions, including a man who did mosaics (good photo of Dame Edna depicted forever in burnt toast), and the notion of a toasteddfod (get it, eisteddfod?  nope just me that was both amused and intrigued).

On this site, i found one to http://www.poppadom.org.uk/, which stands for People Out Practising Paperfolding And Dining On Masala.  Including some AWFUL (yet strangely amusing) renames of our favourite songs: Poppadom Preach (Madonna, Korma Chameleon (Culture Club), Poppas got a brand now Saag (James Brown), You Can't Curry Love (Supremes), It's My Chapati and I Cry If I Want To (Dave Stewart and Barbara Gaskin), Dansak on the Ceiling (Lionel Richie), We Are Jalfrezi (Sister Sledge).  I could go on, but I feel you might throw things at me.  Pun(jab) central, i thought.  I'll leave you with some ABBA: Tikka chance on me, Wateralloo / Vindallo, Dansak Queen, The winner takes a dahl, Chicken Tikka (you and I know).

http://www.nickrobinson.info/clients/poppadom/queen.htm are some alternative lyrics to a well known Queen song: I See a Little Chicken Tikka on the Side; Rogan Josh, Rogan Josh, Pass the Chutney Made of Mango; Vindaloo Does Nicely - Very Very Spicy - see if you can guess the song!!!

Basically, lots of laughter to be had.  If anybody comes up with anythign to match, share it!!!

ANd before I leave you, YES!  I do have too much time on my hands :P"

I HATE Rosser windows, i've decided!  The sun is shinign and it's a fucking beautiful day, but because of the manky windows i can't have the iwndow open properly and enjoy the fresh air :(  and it's too nippy to sit out in it, not to mention the wet grass!"

Christmas was fun, was nice to see friends etc over the holidays, and of course 3 days of rest!!!
I love Christmas really - my fave bit is the carols...  I guess I'm a bit sad like that!

This year, for nine lessons, I was asked to open the service with the first verse of once in royal as a solo - sooooo nervous - you could see me shaking!  And I was a li'l late on my top E, but WOW!  I think I knocked a few hats off lol (i have a very strong, forceful yet nice voice hwen I try).  Although Laura's gran asked ""was that a boy or a gril?"", because i looked manly yet was wearing 3 inch heels and sing like lesley garrot or julie andrews!!!  I got some really good feedback thuogh :) so all's good...  yes - I like Christmas after a while!

Except for Santa - never liked him!  And then my boss, Mike, the walking rat (evil man), made me DRESS UP as Santa and give out mince pies and talk to children at work - EWW!!!  I was even mistaken for Brad, which is just insulting!  Anywho!

I had a really wierd text-convo with my ex today, we were talking about our breka-up and how it hurt me, and whether i wanted him back; and then he was being sweet and talkinga bout how i'll find someone, who'll be right for me etc.

Actually, there is this one guy I'm really hoping to get to know properly; I work with him (sort of; employed by same company, work in same building), but different departments.  Well anyway, I really fancy him!  cute, quirky, but nice and really easy to get on with!  Don't know mch about him, but like I say, he seems nice!  Fingers crossed for that one I think - have to take him for coffee or something!

Got new year sorted too - going out to dinner with Viv and loads of other church mates - the Boujhon curry house.  Should be great fun!

Right - must go now, probably be another month or so before I update this again!  Only got one more day of freedom to do some college stuff before i have to go back to the li'l rat at Safeway - grr!  At least Rob might be working ;-) (always a good thing!)"

<P>HE asked me what I was looking for from him, and I explained about how i'm looking for a special someone who i can snuggle up with, spend time with, care for, love, make them feel better then they feel low, make them feel wanted, and how I want somebody special to do the same for me.&nbsp; I then added that I thought I wntaed that person to be him.</P>
<P>And he explaiend that he looks for friends, and when he's found his perfect frined then that's it!&nbsp; And that exclusivity wasn't an optino for him at the moment.&nbsp; However that he still wanted to be friends, and htat he didn't know what the future held.&nbsp; He then kindly warned me not to wait around on his part, because i might miss somebody for me!</P>
<P>THEN he introduced person X, who he can't stop thinking about (person X is already taken and there's nothin between them).&nbsp; I was midly upset by this, as I can't get Tom out of my head, and i'm not in his at all :(</P>
<P>So basically, he didn't say yes.&nbsp; he didn't say no.&nbsp; he jsut said not now, but i've learnt it's the same as when people say ""we'll see.""&nbsp; they're syaing ""no"" without actually saying it!!!</P>
<P>So i'm quite pissed off with myself at the moment, becuase i've done it again!&nbsp; I always do it; fall for people that odn't reciprocate my feelings.&nbsp; On the other hand, he did lead me on!&nbsp; He apologised for it; i mean you don't generally kiss somebody unless you like htem, and he did kiss me goodnight the other week, and has led me on for a week.&nbsp; But never mind; i'll get over it, AGAIN...</P>
<P>Had a good day today, college from9 till 5 so i'm a bit tired, but i had a good ICT lesson flirting with Adam ;-)&nbsp; (i AM an angel really; can't you see the halo??? Actually you're right; it's only there because it's hooked onto my horns!!!)</P>

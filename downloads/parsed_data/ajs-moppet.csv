BUT, it really burns me up when I hear that from someone (ok, 2 people, specifically) that I've tried and tried and tried to maintain contact with, without ever getting a response from them.  I know they may not mean it that way, but it's kind of a slap in the face to know that the pains I took weren't even noticed/were forgotten--especially when there's been no effort on their part to reach me before or after I tried numerous times to catch up with them.  And especially when I've been thinking, ""ok...I've tried x number of times over x number of months/years...maybe they just want me to leave them the hell alone.  Maybe I'm just annoying them/pissing them off/seeming like a stalker.""

In short:  If you've made at least a reasonable effort to keep in touch with me, and I haven't responded/have taken forever to respond/respond sporadically, then bitch away.  I deserve it, and I promise that I will feel extremely guilty.  Honest.

If you haven't made a reasonable effort to keep in touch with me, and have not responded to my attempts, DO NOT EVEN THINK OF TRYING TO LAY THE BLAME ON ME OR MAKE IT SOUND AS IF I'VE DROPPED THE BALL/DON'T CARE."

"event","Ok, folks.  I can never keep track of what happened from year to year.  Used to have a mind like the ol' steel trap.  Not for a while now.  So, I'm using this meme to kind of keep track of things...We'll see if I remember to do it again next year.

That one meme:

1. Where did you begin 2008?
On the runway at SFO.  Whoo!

2. What was your status by Valentines Day?
As in *romantic* status?  Same as it has been for a few years now:  Single and trying to remember when I last got laid.

3. Were you in school anytime this year?
Nope.  

4. Did you have to go to the hospital?
Oh, yes indeedy.  See #32.

5. Did you have any encounters with the police?
Not really.  A couple of sobriety checkpoints, and there were some nice one at the rally in SF...

6. Where did you go on vacation?
CANCUN!!!  I actually have a good answer for a change!!!  Also, to VA, which is where I am now.  At Beth's.  On her roomie's computer.  WITH A COPY OF THE ONION THAT I SNAGGED ON THE WAY FROM THE METRO.

7. What did you buy over $110?
A camera...And I think that's it.


8. Did you know anybody who got married?
Yup.  ::shout out to Del::  A few others, as well.  It was a crazy year for weddings.

9. Did you know anybody who passed away?
A few, sadly.

10. Did you move anywhere?
Our department moved this year.  And I'm working on plans to move in March.  Does that count?

11. What sporting events did you attend?
Couple of baseball games.

12. What concerts/shows did you go to?
Ummm...you know, I don't think I went to any this year!

13. Describe your birthday.
Very nice--a relative non-event, with lots of bday wishes from my friends.  And the chance to open my bday gift from my parents WITH my parents.  (I got a Tahitian pearl necklace...which is my bday gift for the next several years.)

14. What is the ONE thing you thought you would not do, but did, in 2008?
One?!

15. What have been your favorite moments?
All of the time I spent in Cancun, Del's wedding, finding out that someone important to me wasn't angry with me anymore, SEBASTOPOL, and time spent laughing with friends.

16. Any new additions to your family?
Not that I'm aware of...

17. What was your best month?
April, hands down.

18. Who has been your best drinking buddy?
Ummm...I don't really drink that much, and when I do, it's usually just a glass of wine with dinner and not really a social occasion.  If you can substitute other forms of ""misbehaving"" for drinking, I'd say Das and Del.

19. Made new friends?
Yes.  Or rather, I realized that a few folks had actually been friends of mine for a while and I just didn't know it.

20. Favourite night out?
For the moment, I'll say the ride back from the airport in April.  ::snort::

21. Other than home, where did you spend most of your time?
At Scott and Dacia's.  Which is really just my second home.  

22. Have you lost any friends this year?
Not really, no.

23. Change your hairstyle?
I got a significant haircut, but the style itself hasn't changed.  In fact, when I went to visit my high school the other day, every single person I encountered said, ""You haven't changed at ALL!  I mean, not a bit!""

24. Have any car accidents?
::zipping lips::

25. How old did you turn this year?
28.  Oy.

26. Do you have a New Years resolution?
I do have a couple of resolutions to make, but D and I decided that it's silly to wait for a particular day to start trying to make a change to your life.  So, resolutions--yes.  New Year's resolutions--only if it strikes me on that particular day.

27. Do anything embarrassing?
Oh, of course.  I'm me, folks.

28. Buy anything from eBay?
::giggle::  One thing.

29. Get married or divorced?
Thank god the answer is ""no"" to both of those.

30. Get hit on?
I'm honestly not entirely sure.  Hit on by anyone I'd consider hittin' back?  Definitely no.

31. Been snowboarding?
I leave that to Beth.  I did the ziplining/cliff-diving/jungle-trekking thing in April.  That's enough flirting with death for me.

32. Did you get sick this year?
So sick that my director made a note in my review about ""the virus from hell.""  Lost 10 pounds in under a week, and wound up in the ER with an IV bag strapped to my arm, and a couple doses of morphine.  

33. Are you happy to see 2008 go?
Yes, but not because it was a bad year.  I'm just ready to make even more progress with things in 2009.

34. Been naughty or nice?
Quite a bit of both...but I think ""nice"" outweighed ""naughty,"" dammit.

35. What are you looking forward to most in 2009?
Ummm...Meghann's wedding, of course.  Outside of that...I don't know.  I am kind of hoping that romance might be out there somewhere..."

"event","I'm actually going to be celebrating Thanksgiving with people for the first time in years!  I'm half giddy, half nervous at this point, but determined not to chicken out again.

I'll be venturing out to D & S's place, which is all well and good, seeing as how I practically live there anyway.  The only difference is, this time, a bunch of their family will be there, several of whom I haven't met before.  On the plus side, though, I have met D's dad and sister before, so that will help a lot.  (For all my loud-mouthiness and silliness, I am at times one of the shy-est people on the planet, especially when it comes to meeting my friends' families.)  I don't know why, but it always scares me to death.

But, I'm sucking it up this year, and am actually pretty damned excited.  I didn't know what the hell to bring with me--D is planning on a big menu already, and there's only so much fridge space--but then I had a good idea:  I picked up this game called ""Smartypants"" for Wii, which is supposed to be good for all ages and has lots of room for silliness, so I think it'll go over well with the 7-year-old as well as the adults...I hope.  

I'm also terrified of the fact that a kid will be there, but I know that tomorrow, D's sister will be there, and she looooves kids, so I'll be kind of off the hook.  If I go over tonight, it'll be a bit later in the evening--definitely after 7:30--so I won't have to freak out about what to say and do as far as the kid is concerned for too long.  (Note:  It's not that I detest kids--though I do detest ill-mannered children--it's just that I have nooooo idea how to talk to them...which is funny to me, because I always swore I'd be an adult who can relate to kids.  Ah, irony.)

And, I do have a couple of cigs left over from last weekend to help me through it if I need 'em.  :)  (I'm doing really well with not smoking, despite that last sentence.  Yay!)

With that said, I'm off to feed the animals and check out the traffic/weather situation to see if it's worth the trip tonight."

"event","Yesterday, I vacuumed the house and dusted furniture in the living room and den.  That done, I allowed myself to revel in the luxury of remaining in bed, curled up with a book, and napping on and off for the rest of the day.  Literally.  After the week I'd had at work, my body needed to be turned off for a while.

This morning, I bounced out of bed before 7 a.m. and jumped straight into other chores that I'd been ignoring, or that I could do today instead of after work and going to the shrink on Monday.

I threw the first load of laundry into the machine, fed the animals, cleaned out the catbox, clipped Dewey's claws (which he was a total shit about...I don't know why...He's been doing pretty good about it here lately...) and jumped into the shower.  After that, I switched the first load of laundry into the dryer, and got the 2nd load into the washer.  Then, I scurried back to my room and began dusting the furniture and windowsill and such, then vacuumed, dry-Swiffered, and wet-Swiffered the floor.  I also pulled the batik thingy off my file cabinet so it could be washed, along with sheets, blanket, duvet, pillow cases, etc...

About that time, the load in the dryer finished, so I ran in to grab pants that needed to be creased and put on hangers, etc., and folded t-shirts and such before they could get wrinkly.  Switched the 2nd load (whites) into the dryer, and shoved the bedding and batik into the washer.  ::phew::  Then, I scooted back to the bathroom to brush my teeth.  Ta da.

Right about now, I'm waiting for the whites to dry so I can get the bedding dry so I can make the bed.  Once that's done, I'll be heading off to the store to pick up the pants that I ordered last weekend, and I'll probably grab a couple of things at the grocery store on my way home...After I treat myself to something yummy for lunch.

I'm very proud that all these things have been done, and it's only 9:15.  :)  Once I get back from the stores, I do believe I shall finally watch Iron Man, which Paula was nice enough to loan me.

Hee."

"event","I've always rolled my eyes at politics and elections--mostly because I believed that 90% of it was bullshit.  (Especially elections.  Why is it so hard to just have a straight vote?  Why does it have to be laundered through the Electoral College?)  I've always been taught that the simplest approach is usually the best.  So, get rid of the whole ""electoral votes"" BS and just count the effing votes individually.  Why is that so hard?  You have to register to vote already anyway.  You have to show proof that you are who you are before you can vote anyway.  They have to count all the freaking votes in order to figure out how many electoral doodads each candidate got in a particular state anyway.  Why not just cut out that last step and let the process be...I dunno...DEMOCRATIC?

Yes, I know. I'm probably oversimplifying.  I'm probably very naive about how the world works.  But I know that when Mountain Dew or M&M's puts out a ""Vote for the new Dew"" or ""Vote for the next color"" campaign, they don't have any electoral college.  And I have to say that I believe that Americans are more likely to vote for that crap than for a presidential candidate.  So, it can't be that hard to do, logistically, especially considering that it only happens once every four years.

And how the hell is it not shady that a candidate can win, say, 250,000 more popular votes than his/her opponent...yet...lose the election?  Of the people, for the people, by the people...Isn't the thing most representative of that sentiment a popular-vote system?  Whenever we took a vote on something in class, by show of hands, majority ruled.  Period.  The left side of the classroom didn't get to overthrow that because their votes counted more than the right side's.  And how can the EC still be viewed as representative of the people when it returns results that are the *opposite* of how the majority voted?!  Shouldn't the EC *reflect* the opinions of the people?

You know, people keep slapping a woman's right to choose on the chopping block, while we all sit here waiting for the blade to come down and dispatch it once and for all, finally breathing a sigh of relief when the stay of execution finally comes.  I think it's time for the existence of the EC to put its lily white neck on the line.  We've gotten rid of other outdated institutions that no longer serve a purpose.  At worst, dismantling the EC would be a mercy killing.

::sigh::  I'm twitchy and cranky because, for only the second time in my life--9/11 being the first--I am truly afraid of what could lie ahead for this country.  I feel that I can bitch and moan about those fears because for once, I'm going to do the one thing that I can to try to put things on a better course.  I've taken my right to vote for granted too long.  Too many people fought for me to have that right--think of the suffragettes alone who were beaten, jailed, or worse--and while I'm ashamed that it's taken me this long to exercise that right, I know that when I do vote tomorrow, I do so with a full understanding of its heft and importance."

"event","So, for the first time in eons, I allowed myself to drink as much as I wanted tonight.  I can't even remember the last time I consumed alcohol, much less in any measurable quantity.  I had 3 glasses of champagne, and I swear, it hit me as hard as an entire 750ml of tequila used to. Which brought me to the title question:  Why did I drink so much back then?

It's nice at first, that little bit of tipsiness.  But, since it *has* been forever since I was drunk last, said drunkeness kicked in before I expected it to.  Nothing horrible, but a touch of the room-spins.  Prior to that kicking in, I did love the feeling of relaxation and the lack of focus on any particular thought in my head.  (Ah, she may be on to something...)  However, when I couldn't quiiiiite walk a straight line as I traversed the room to get a glass of juice, I realized that I didn't really like that.  I kind of wished I had the sense back then to realize this.  :)

The upside?  I don't think I'm in danger of ever slipping back into alcoholism.  I think I put my body through enough back then that it won't *let* me go nuts now, which is an excellent deterrent. (Sometimes, just the smell of certain liquors is enough to make me queasy.)  I think the Scots-Irish part of me has finally given way to the Cherokee part of me, LOL.

With that said, Veuve Clicquot is definitely fan*tas*tic champagne.  However, I believe I shall restrict myself to 2 glasses at most, if I ever happen to be in possession of it again."

"event","I'm referring to myself.  On many levels tonight.

I've had a weird, edgy feeling ever since I got home.  Usually, I just channel that into being REALLY productive.  I did that tonight, too, cleaning the hell out of my room, organizing shit, peeling off the old sticker from my license plate, cleaning the plate, and putting the shiny, new 2009 sticker on it, etc.  Went through some books to do a check on which ones I quit reading halfway through, which ones I hadn't read yet, which ones made me think, ""holy hell, I didn't know I *had* that and I was going to pick it up this weekend...""  Downloading the music I promised Donnie I'd burn for him.  

Then, out of the flipping blue, an old high school crush popped into my head.  Right now, I honestly don't know if there was a thought process that lead me to her, or if it really was just ::BAM:: there.  This was someone I had a crush on for four years.  Big time.  I think I was pretty much as ""in love"" with someone as you could be at 15, 16, 17, you know?

The friendship ended (?) badly--we were really close for a long time, and she even told me one day during senior year that she had feelings for me.  So, I piped right up and said that the feeling was mutual, and then she got this look on her face like she just stepped in dogshit.  (Yeah, I'm still trying to figure that one out, myself.)  Obviously, we chose to stay friends, which sort of worked for a while.

College came, and we wound up going to 2 different schools--both women's colleges, and both in the same state.  All of a sudden, I was not cool enough to hang with her, and despite my biased position here, I can safely say that she let me know this in a really horrible way (Beth was around when it happened, and I think if I mentioned it to her today, she'd still be pissed at this chick.)  Then, over the summer that year, she wanted to go back to being friends, and was apologetic.  For the first time in my life, I actually stood up for myself and didn't just go running back to someone.  I left it with the fact that I wasn't really sure I could trust her, and I didn't really think we could have the level of friendship that we'd had in the past.

That was, pretty much, the last I saw of her.

So, why am I a dumbass, you say?  Because.  Because I was full of that weird, nervous energy shit, and without even thinking about what I was doing, I found myself Googling her flipping name.  Hers was the very first picture that came up, and the moment I saw it, all that stuff came rushing back--from the good stuff, like cooking with her at her parents' house and wandering around Carytown and critiquing each other's poetry together and making faces at each other in Senior Seminar, to all the bad shit, like her criticisms and tendency towards being *really* judgmental about stupid shit and the shitty way she treated her friends.

And THEN, I actually thought about trying to CONTACT her, because after all these years, there's that little part of me that would feel...(this sucks to admit, because I'm supposed to be badass, dammit!) would feel validated if I could just have her approval, in some form.  Because I just want to know that she doesn't think I'm a loser.  Sweet buttery Jesus, what the hell is up with that?  1.)  You have a crush on someone for 4 years and do nothing about it.  2.) You let your ""best friend"" treat you like shit and pretty much get away with it for a long time before you finally say something (while secretly hoping it'll work out ok).   3.) Eight years or so after you last saw her, her opinion of you still MATTERS?

Holy hell, folks.  There are names in psychiatric circles for people like me."

"event","Thinking about my day has led me to have one of those brief ""whoa, who am I again?!"" moments.  Does that ever happen to you?  You're going along with life, and the day-to-day seems just that--nothing out of the ordinary, or at least, not so much that it throws you for a loop--until all of a sudden, you run through a little mental list of things you have planned/things that happened recently and you realize none of it sounds like *you*?

For instance, I went shopping this past weekend for some clothes.  Slightly unusual, but the weird-o-meter dips back down when you get to what I actually bought.  I needed a couple of pairs of shorts, since I don't really have any, and I wound up buying 2 pairs of men's shorts, since they fit like I want.  (I hate hoochie shorts, and that's all they have...aside from Mom-Shorts.)  I also found, at half price, thankyouverymuch, some *great* cargo pants.  I have been in withdrawal since the zipper broke on my old pair, but didn't want to fork out the money to have it fixed since I could spend about the same for a whole new pair.  

Anyway, the part that gets weird is that I was buying these for my trip to Cancun.  Me.  Taking a ""luxury"" vacation to somewhere with white sand and acres of jungle.  It feels weird.  (Don't get me wrong, I'm excited about this trip!)  But...I suddenly feel so bourgeois, and it makes me feel slightly *wrong* to be going somewhere like that just for fun--and there's a whooole 'nother journal entry there.

By the same token, however, I also purchased a 6-pack of little plastic water pistols for a buck--also for Cancun.  Cuz what fun is the pool/ocean without squirt guns?  This makes me feel more like me.

Then, I spent a sizeable chunk of time trying not to lose my patience with a bridal shop while trying to order my bridesmaid dress.  (The last thing I want to do is eff things up for the bride by screwing up something like getting my dress on time, even though she would probably be ok if I were up there in jeans and a bandana.  I just don't want to be the one responsible for making her day look tacky.)  Me.  Bridesmaid.  Dress.  Quoi?

And (potentially TMI, but whatever, deal with it) I'm trying to work up the motivation to go shave my legs here in a minute--which I haven't done since sometime before Thanksgiving, cuz I wear pants all the time and ain't gettin' any, so why bother?  We all know how un-Chris it is to be all shave-y.  (Though 'tis *very* Chris to be celibate.) But, not only am I doing this, I'm doing this so I can wear shorts/a bathing suit this weekend so I can *sunbathe* for my *trip to Cancun* so I'll have a *base tan*.

What the French toast???"

"event","Gerber-style, that is.  I finally made it to solid food--real solid food!

After a week with practically nothing to eat, I had a real meal tonight, and it has so far managed to stay with me.  All I had while at work today was a few crackers, some yogurt, and a banana--which is actually quite a few steps up the ladder.

But, once I was free from work and safe to try real food in the comfort of my own home, I pigged out on Applebee's.  (Yeah, of all things, I know.)  I ate about half an order of the chicken fajita rollup, and quite a few fries.  A hearty feast, indeed.

As of this morning, I was down a total of 9.8 lbs, so this should help to tip the scales the other way.  :)"

"event","After having been unable to eat anything for a few days, I finally found myself ready to attempt eating something.  I chose toast, somewhat reluctantly.  (Now that I'm in a place where food actually sounds *good*, my thoughts are more along the lines of, well, tasty stuff.  My brain, however, has the sense to say ""No, if you eat pizza, you will die.  Worse, you will wish that you *could* die."")

So, I went about the (thankfully) brief and easy business of making said toast--was even daring enough to add a little butter.  I knew what to expect.  Dry, boring, but at least I'd be *eating* something.

It was the best damned toast I'd ever eaten.  I moaned a little."

"event","Late Monday night, I woke up with a really not-so-good feeling in my stomach.  Can't quite describe it--just knew that something Very Bad was going on in there.

Tuesday morning, I got up, still feeling oogie, and got into the shower.  Nearly passed out three times, and had to lie down three times in order to finish the whole process.  Then, the vomiting and Other Evil started.  Every time I tried to stand up, my body quickly and violently protested.  Finally, I realized that going to work was not an option if I couldn't stand up.

I crawled back into bed and called my co-worker to let her know I wouldn't be in, then fell asleep with my hair still wrapped up in a towel.  I pretty much slept for the rest of the day, all the while thinking I would be able to go into work the next day.

That night, my roomie took me to an Urgent Care center where they prescribed an antiemetic.  This worked, but then the Other Evil started working overtime.  I was not able to bring liquids into my body nearly as quickly as they were leaving.

Wednesday morning, I again got up to take a shower, and wound up having to lie down after washing my face, after washing my body, after shampooing my hair, and after rinsing the conditioner out of my hair.  Vomiting and Other Evil continued to be the protest weapons of choice if I tried to stand up for more than a few seconds at a time.  I tried to walk to the kitchen to feed my cat, but had to stop for a 10-minute rest on the futon in the living room--a convenient halfway point.  It was then that I realized there was no way in hell I could walk the half mile from my car to the office, much less work an 8-hour day.  Again, I called my co-worker and wound up falling asleep with my hair still wrapped up and the phone still in my hand.

Liquid retention was in the negative zone, as every time I tried to drink something, I wound up having to go--and usually produced more than I had just taken in.  At around 9:00 last night, I told my roommate that if things weren't better in the morning, I would need a ride to the ER.

About an hour later, after realizing that I hadn't been able to pee since Monday night, completely dehydrated, exhausted, and just plain physically worn-out, I collapsed on the bathroom floor in tears.  (Well, crying.  No moisture with which to make actual tears.)  Roomie decided that now was the time to go to the ER.  Which was a good thing, as things would be very bad for me right now if I had waited.

Got to ER, and continued with exhaustion from trips to the bathroom every 5-10 minutes.  Finally, an IV was hooked up with fluids.  They gave me a second bag with potassium, as my levels were low.  They also gave me an anti-diarrheal, which did not work at all, and I continued to make trips to the restroom every 5-10 minutes, with worsening stomach cramps.  Eventually, they gave me morphine, which helped a LOT.  After two bags of fluids (which isn't nearly as bad as the *nine* that I needed that one time), two doses of morphine, and 9 hours in the ER, I was allowed to go home.

Am feeling better, but very tired.  I haven't eaten since Monday, and I put my body through way more than I should have before finally giving in and going to the hospital...Lesson learned:  When you can't remember the last time you peed, you should probably seek medical attention."

It's so nice to have people in my life that are just happy that I'm in their lives, and it's nice to have folks that I'm happy to have in mine.

I hardly ever communicate with anyone over the phone anymore--I think that's partly because I spend so much time at work talking on the phone with people that make me want to strangle them--but I was just thinking about the conversation I had with Via (months ago at this point), and how nice it was to just talk to someone that I knew and who knew me--and liked to talk to me anyway, LOL.

"event","In case it was not already blindingly apparent, I suck at keeping in touch with people.  When I was younger, I obsessed over writing letters back to people (yes, real pen-and-paper letters), checking emails, keeping AIM (does anybody remember that?!) running and away messages at least semi-up-to-date or at the worst, posting some smart-ass quote but still having the damn message up so you'd know I wasn't around.  I got excited about the phone ringing, and thrilled to death when I had voicemail waiting for me.

Now, I come home and I cringe when the phone rings.  Voicemail light blinking?  Screw it.  I can check it later.  (And then guilt creeps in under the guise of ""Chriiis, what if it's an emergency?  What if someone's sick/in the hospital/having a reeeeally shitty day and just needs to talk?"")  Emails?  I love reading them to see what's going on with everyone, but actually *responding*?  You might as well ask me to fly to the moon and back with my very own set of handmade wings.

The worst part of all of it?  It kills me because I *want* to talk to my friends.  I miss them like crazy--the conversations we had, the shit we used to do (drunk or sober, it was all good times to me), the way we just used to be there for each other.  And nothing is worse than watching your friends doing their damnedest to keep in touch with you, even when you're not responding, and feeling like a total asshole for being a waste of their time.  Because it's not just that I sit there and go ""ugh, I don't feel like writing back/calling back"" and have that be the end of it.  Noooo, I agonize over it for hours, lose sleep over it, wish I could just pick up the damn phone or just bang out an email like I used to.  But, I usually don't.

I've mentioned before my fantasy of having the Practical Magic house and filling it up with my nearest and dearest, all of us living together, within shouting distance at most.  And that would be wonderful.  It would also be impossible.  I know this, and yet, I suck at doing the only thing that comes in as a close second--keeping in touch with loved ones.  Instead, I just make everyone feel like I'm not interested in hanging out with or talking to them, when that's the furthest thing from the truth.

What happened?  I don't know.  In college, when the summer or winter months hit and it meant a month or more of not being with my friends, you could barely pry my hands off the keyboard.  I'd panic if I couldn't get a connection to the internet for fear that I might miss chatting with someone on AIM, and I'd be practically heartbroken if I didn't get to talk to at least *one* person before the day was over.

I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me, and I don't know why you keep trying.  I'm grateful that you do, but I gotta say that I'm at a loss as to why."

"event","Hey everyone--

I just found out about www.freerice.com.  It's awesome!  It just started last month, and already, a huge amount of rice has been donated to folks without food (over a billion grains and counting).  It's a pretty impressive campaign--especially when you consider what a simple idea it really is.
 
Basically, you go to this site and take a multiple-choice vocabulary quiz.  The words keep coming as long as you're willing to sit there and answer.  For every word you get right, 10 grains of rice are donated.  (That doesn't sound like much, but multiply that by 50 words, and then by 100 people...)
 
They don't ask for your email address or any info--you just go to the site and bam! there's the never ending string of words to figure out.  And if you get 'em wrong, you still get to keep going.  They just give you easier words.  (Conversely, if you get 3 right in a row, they'll give you harder words.)
 
I'm going to try to donate 1,000 grains a week--or whatever they'll let me.  I didn't see anything about a maximum amount.  Oh!  And the other good part?  If you accidentally close your browser in the middle of playing, you don't ""lose"" any rice--it's recorded on their server in real-time.  It's a win-win kind of thing--you get to exercise your brain and learn new words, and hungry people get fed.
 
We're all smart folks, and we all waste a bunch of time playing around with stupid stuff on the internet anyway.  Why not goof around with this for a bit?
 
Love,
Chris"

"event","Lots going on, I guess, but I just haven't had the time (or energy) to sit down and type it all up.  For now, I'll post about Beth's trip out here.  Well, part of it.  I'll post about the whole trip later...though I realize that I frequently say that, and then never get back to it...Oh well.

The last night that she was here, we had gotten back to the house around 4:00.  We sat out on the front porch bench until after 9:00, just talking.  It was one of those weird, rambling conversations that started out with philosophical chatter about war and politics and religion, and then wound up about slightly more down-to-earth stuff.

Most importantly, we talked about her mother for the first time since she passed away.  I'd been feeling horrible that we'd never really spoken about it, aside from a sentence here and there, because we're best friends, and this was something of enormous importance that happened to her.  And for pete's sake, as her best friend, I should have been supporting her throughout the whole ordeal.

I don't want to get into the specifics of what she spoke about, because I feel that's (obviously) highly personal and it's not my place to spout out all the things that were inside her head.  I'm just glad that we got to do it, and, selfishly, I feel better that I was able to let her know that it killed me that I wasn't able to be there with her in the hospital, or to say goodbye to Joyce, or to be there with Beth afterwards.  I needed her to know that I cared...which, I'm sure she knew, but I needed her to hear it...and I think she did, too.

We also talked about what the hell it is that I'm going to do with my life, and she helped me to focus in on one goal at a time, instead of trying to figure out how the hell I'm going to do these ninety things I want to do.  It's weird, because I was so used to being the one providing direction to those around me, and I hadn't even realized I didn't have a direction of my own.  It also opened my eyes to the fact that I *don't* have to figure everything out by myself--I should be asking questions and bouncing ideas off of people I trust.  I think I'd really gotten into the mindset of being alone and having to figure shit out for myself, and had also forgotten that that's kind of what friends are *for*...and SWWNBN kinda instilled in me that I'd be a whiny jackass or a stupid baby if I asked for help.  Of course, I now realize that was coming from a girl who was seriously fucking up her life, and her son's.  Not the best person's ranting to use as a guide, ya know?

Beth's a great person, and I'm so proud of who she's become.  I just hope that wherever her mother is, she can see how amazing her daughter is and can be proud of that.  I know that I'm proud to be able to say that she is my best friend."

"event","This past weekend was AMAZINGLY wonderful.

I packed up all my camping stuff, headed to work for a half day, drove to Vallejo, transferred all my shit to D's car, we grabbed a bite to eat, and then we hit the road.

The drive to the campsite was gorgeous--super-twisty mountain road with a jaw-dropping view of about 12 different cities below (ok, maybe it was only 1, I dunno, but damn.)  We checked in and bumped our way down to the campsite, which was perrrrfectly situated for our tastes.  (Private, but not too isolated, far enough from the bathroom/showers to avoid the noise and the smell, but close enough for those 3 a.m. pee breaks not to be overly daunting, etc.)  Of course, it didn't hurt that we had the ENTIRE CAMPGROUND TO OURSELVES Friday night.  :) 

We set up camp fairly quickly.  Not that we rushed.  Things just went smoothly.  We nosed around the park for a while, then headed back and cranked up some music and goofed around for a bit.  We moseyed through dinner, dragging it out until it was dark enough to light a fire for (what else) s'mores.  We ate our fill of those (cinnamon graham crackers, Nutella, banana slices, and the requisite gooey, toasty marshmallow) and then, once the fire was low enough to be safe, we headed down the road a short way from camp to stargaze.  (Don't freak--we were within view of our fire.)

The entire dome of sky was sitting right over us, with nothing obstructing the view for a full 360 degrees.  It was pretty dark, and we could see the Milky Way, which D had never seen before.  We also saw an incredibly bright shooting star before we headed back to the campsite.  Mostly, we just stood there with our mouths open, in awe of how freaking huge the universe is, and how tiny we are.

Before we went to bed, we were almost invaded by an army of raccoons, but once I shone the flash light on them (to figure out what the heck was running toward us), they scattered.  The next night, just as we had zipped ourselves into the tent, we heard ""someone"" approaching the tent, so I went out to check it out.  About 4 feet away from me was a doe, who just kind of looked at me for a second, then went about munching leaves from the tree beside our tent.  She brought her fawn with her the next morning, just after we woke up and started eating breakfast.

Saturday was our beach day, and that was awesome.  The water was *freezing* cold, but D made me go in anyway.  It was so much fun and so inspiring to be in the ocean, pushed along by these huge, yet gentle, waves...The sand was nice and warm, and felt reeeeally good once we finally came out of the water.  We also grabbed some great vegetarian food at the Saturn Cafe, which is my favorite place to eat in Santa Cruz.

We headed back to camp, after stopping to pick up more Gatorade and a board game (because we are proudly cheesy like that.)  Dinner was killer, and the s'mores were even better.  We chatted and stared at pretty things for a long time, then I taught her how to play the game we picked up, and we had a ball with that.  More stargazing and close encounters with nature, then we hit the sack.

At 5 a.m., we woke up and checked out the stars, then curled back up to sleep for a bit longer.  By 6:30, we were both up and grabbing breakfast.  (That's when we saw the doe and fawn together.)  We explored a little more of the park, then packed up and took the scenic route (Hwy 1) back home.

On the way, we pulled over on a whim to check out a tiny little cliffside beach.  It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.  There was a rock cave/tunnel to one side that led to the ocean, a sandy beach to the right, and a big tongue of rock in the middle, with tiny tide pools at the outer edge.  In the little inlet, there were two huge, craggy, building-sized rocks.  One looked kind of like a tugboat, and the other one was just a craggy monolith with a little cave on one side.  The water was dark blue and green and purple, and I was so overwhelmed that I actually *skipped* over to D, shouted out ""I'm so happy!"" and hugged her.

We had both needed a weekend away from everything (TV, people, cell phones, internet, regular phones, all of it), and this was the most perfect solution that we could have come up with.  When we were energetic, we went in seek of nature, when we were tired and lounge-y, nature came to us...

I can't wait to do it again."

"event","Today was a gym day.  Today was also a Das-and-Chris-are-hormonal-and-don't-really-want-to-work-out day.  Therefore, Das and Chris went to the gym.  And that's it.  We went to the gym--and proceeded to hang out and chat in the locker room.

As we're chatting, a pretty physically fit woman steps out of the dressing room, sighs heavily, looks at us with a sense of irony, and says, ""I left my shoes at home.""  We both wince and begin commiserating, as there is nothing so frustrating as packing your shit, hauling your ass to the gym, getting dressed, and then realizing a vital part of your wardrobe never made it into the bag.  

""Oh yeah, man.  That sucks.  We've both been there before.""
""Yeah...but I'm teaching the aerobics class.""
::silence, then...::  ""Ooooh.  Damn.""

Then, I look at her feet and ask, ""what size shoe do you wear, anyway?""
""Um...8 1/2, 9.""
::wiggling toe of shoe::  ""These are a 9...do you want to try 'em?""
""What?  Really?  Are you serious?""
""Yeah, knock yourself out.  I'm just sitting here anyway.""

So, she tries them on, and sure enough, they fit.  We chat for a bit, and are all three laughing at the situation, and several other women come over to see what the hubbub is about.  In all, about 10 or 11 people are amazed that I just randomly let this woman borrow my shoes to go teach class--and that Das and I are just gonna hang out in the locker room until she's done with the class, with me in my sock feet.  One woman even started to laugh when she noticed that she and the instructor had the same shoes.  ""Oh, no--these are Chris' shoes, not mine!""  This, of course, led to another retelling of the situation, and more people got involved.  

It was bizarre, but fun, and as I told D, ""Well, even if she takes off with my shoes and I never see them again, at least I have an interesting story.""  (I got the shoes back, btw.)

So yeah, sometimes being lazy can actually be good for your karma."

"event","I live.  Really.  I do continue to exist.

I logged on last night for the first time in ages, and spent a good amount of time checking in on everyone, and was happy to see that for the most part, y'all are doing all right.

Came home from a CRAZY day at work, cleaned the catbox, cleaned the bathroom, threw in a load of laundry, clipped the cat's claws (am now covered in cat hair...Dewey is not very good about having this done), and decided to continue in the manic vein of productivity that I seem to be in.  (Though it be rapidly fading.)

To fill you in, things have been nuts.  Work has been swamped, and due to this, my weekends have been overtaken with real-world avoidance, which in turn makes weekdays even more hectic as I have to do shit pre- and/or post-weekend revelry.  (For example, laundry and housecleaning is normally done on Friday night so I can laze about on Saturday and Sunday.  However, I have been persuaded to spend the past few weekends at a friend's house, so I am instead squeezing in a load of darks on Wednesday and a load of whites on Thursday--after working all day and then hitting the gym.  Then, I frantically put everything away, pack my shit for the weekend, hit the sheets, bounce back out of bed at 5:00 a.m., head to work, then carve my way through California-style Friday evening traffic.  And don't come back until 10:30 p.m. Sunday.)

I can't remember the last time I just came home from work, tossed my coat and purse in the hall closet, changed into loungey stuff, grabbed dinner, and plopped in front of the TV.  Granted, I gloss over the fact that those nights, I was bored out of my mind and am now somewhat thrilled that I have shit to do.

Aside from an inadvertent 16-mile hike through the park (dunno if I've already told that story) a few weeks ago, nothing is terribly exciting.  That particular adventure was part of my and D's weekly hike, which normally is limited to 8 miles.  We got somewhat discombobulated in the wilderness, though not technically *lost*.  We knew where we were...but we also realized too late that it was way the hell away from everything else, and the return trip to the car was going to suck big fat ones.

As a result of the stupid madness that is work, I'm tentatively taking a half day on Friday two weeks from now, and plan to disappear to a beach somewhere for a bit.  I'm craving quiet.  Not absolute silence, mind you, just the lack of human voices demanding constant attention.  The sound of waves rushing in and out will probably serve as a combination tranquilizer and energizer...Recharging the batteries, if you will.  Not sure if I'm going alone or not, and I like that I don't have to decide this any time soon.

Oh!  Exciting things!!!  I do have exciting things!!  In September, Beth will be coming out to visit, which leads to the second exciting thing--she's coming out to visit so we can do pre-wedding stuff with Del!!!  Yup!  Del's getting married.  (By now, you should have all heard about this, so I don't want to hear any bitching about stealing anybody's thunder, LOL.)  Of course, being girls, we must planplanplanplan.  And hopefully, partypartypartyparty.

Good times.  I'll try to be better about updating, but no promises.  If you really want to know what's up, I suggest email.  I tend to be slightly better about that.  :)"

I think I might have pushed a bit too hard, though.  I felt fine while I was there, but I had a REALLY hard time staying awake while driving back home.  Oops.  I came home and slept from 3:00 to 6:30.  Then, I got up, popped some pain meds so I could eat, then ate enough so I could take the remainder of the meds, aaaand then got a little sick.  (I had thought I'd moved past that getting sick business, but, oh well.  It wasn't that bad.)

I'm taking tomorrow off, seeing as how I still can't quite eat normal food.  (Not without taking painkillers first.)  I also don't think I've been keeping myself hydrated enough, so I'm going to put a little focus on that tomorrow, too.  Heh.  Hopefully, another day of rest will be just what I need, and I can go back to work on Tuesday and be pretty much normal.  :)

The Vicodin made me sick this time (I think because of the remnants of the general anesthesia still in my bloodstream), but the good news is that this morning, I seem to only need the mega-dose Motrin.  I figure if this works, I'll just leave the Vicodin alone.  Besides, Motrin helps to reduce swelling and inflammation anyway, and Vicodin just makes me sleep.  (Though, it was a godsend for broken bones.)

I'm not too puffy yet--just look like a 16-year-old kid at this point and not so much Chip 'n' Dale, thank goodness.  I hope it doesn't go any further than this, LOL.

What else?  Oh, I go in for my follow-up appointment on Tuesday, and I think after I do that, I can start eating more ""regular"" food.  Not that I'm terribly limited--I can still have baked potatoes, steamed veggies (as long as there's no broccoli in it, which is fine with me cuz I don't like broc all that much), ice cream, etc.

So, that's the update.  Nothing much else to report, other than I'm already looking forward to either a delicious Indian meal or an Italian one.  (Maybe Italian, since I made sure to have some Indian food the week before surgery, LOL).  I hope to go to Tilden Park tomorrow, and I think if things continue to progress as well as they have, I should get my wish!"

"event","Man, it's been a while since I've posted.  Combination of being busy and then the computer being all blown up again.

So, what's been going on?  Not a whole hell of a lot, really.  Yes, I did hear about Jerry Falwell.  And yes, it was hard for me not to rejoice at the news.  I forced myself to think ""I'm not glad that a man died...I am glad that a source of such negativity has been extinguished, and that whoever takes his place will do so for the better.""

I'll be going in for oral surgery on June 8th--extraction of 4 impacted wisdom teeth.  Nothing major, but general anesthesia will be involved, so I need a babysitter for the first day of postoperative recuperation.  So, if I disappear again around that time, you'll know why.

Been going through a bit of emotional conflicty crap over the past couple of weeks.  Over what, I'm still not quite comfortable saying...I think once I figure out whether this thing is ""wrong"" or ""right"" or ""neutral,"" I'll be able to talk/write about it a bit more easily.  Suffice it to say that to most people, it would be nothing, but for someone with my history, it's kind of a big effing deal.  Or, it is at the moment.

Ummm...what else?  Briefly flirted with the idea of checking out a condo to buy, but then decided not to go and look because there's no way I can put 10% down on it, which I'm 99.99% sure that I'd have to do.  Besides, I'm aiming to get outta here within 2 years if at all possible anyway.  Too bad...it's a gorgeous place at a great price.  Also within 5 minutes of Das.  (Which means my chances of dragging my ass out of the house would greatly increase.)

Have started smoking again.  Not sure how that happened, but I am in the process of quitting again, too.  It seems like it's much harder this time around.  Or did I just forget how hard it was the last time???  The good news is, the brand of cigs I have now really taste like ass, so it's helping to curb the craving, LOL.

I think that's really about it...My life is boring."

"event","My parents will be coming to visit me this Saturday, and needless to say, I'm excited.  I like to think I'm prepared at this point, minus picking up a few last-minute things (like fresh asparagus, etc.) from the grocery store.

Hopefully, the weather will be good while they're here.  I had hoped that having them come this late in April would help us to avoid the rainy season, and over the past several weeks, it had seemed like the rain was indeed gone.  Then, it started up again--and the extended forecast is showing rain on the Monday that I'd planned our trip down to San Jose.  But, Tuesday is supposed to be sunny again, so we can always do it that day instead.

I'll be taking them to Alcatraz, Pier 39, the Winchester Mystery house, Tilden, (maybe) Santa Cruz, (maybe) Monterey Bay, (maybe) Napa, Berkeley, and possibly showing them the areas in which I used to live.  I'm also going to attempt to introduce them to Indian food and further their experience with Mexican food--which they had for the first time when I was home for Christmas last year.  (They'd eaten at Taco Bell, of course, but they'd never had real Mexican food.)

I'm also planning to cook for them, as well as dining out.  For breakfast, I'm thinking of waffles with raspberries and orange whipped cream, fresh fruit, and veggie sausage.  Dinner one night would be mozzarella-stuffed Italian turkey burgers, roasted asparagus w/parmesan, and maybe a risotto.  I've also got these FANTASTIC little fresh pizzas from Trader Joe's, which each feed two and are great with a salad...

I'm trying to think of what else needs to be done at this point--aside from last-minute cleaning and grocery shopping.  I've mailed them their itinerary and the airport maps, picked up their cereal, tea, sodas, gotten new towels and wash cloths, (I even got brand new sheets for the bed, LOL)...Booked our tickets for Alcatraz, made sure we have each other's cell phone numbers, given them the 3-1-1 instructions for airport security, told them step-by-step how to print their boarding passes online...I need to remember to make iced tea Friday night.  Also have to put sodas for them in my little cooler for when I meet them at the airport, and to bring a lighter for mom (who will have gone nearly 12 hours without a cigarette)...Ugh...I really just need to tackle my room.  It's not really that bad--I just have books stacked everywhere...

"event","The weather here is gorgeous.  Pretty blue sky, bright green grass (this is only a fleeting thing in CA, so I get more excited than you East Coasters), perfectly comfy temperature.  It's not too hot, not too cold, and even with a breeze blowing, it doesn't get that chilly feeling in the air.

I took some time out to go outside and enjoy it, and probably spent a good 5 or 10 minutes just leaning against the orange tree, absorbing the shade and inhaling the scent of the orange blossoms.  The smell is a like a layering of lilac over citrus...delicious.  Can't wait for the fruit to come!  I may even start getting up earlier in the mornings just so I can have time to enjoy a glass of fresh-squeezed OJ.  As in, fresh off the tree...not fresh from traveling a gazillion miles to the grocery store.

The peach and nectarine trees look much better this year.  Only a leaf or two exhibiting signs of peach tree leaf curl--hopefully, it'll stay that way, since we sprayed the trees this winter.  As usual, the lemon tree is positively laden with fruit.  I really need to spend some time in the kitchen cooking up lemon-centered recipes.  Maybe I'll make some more curd and give it to Barb, Rita, and Kim at work.  Will need to buy jars first...Could also make lemon-honey glaze for a yummy fruit salad (hey, a huge blue scrub jay just landed in the lemon tree and is staring at me...I need a second or two to stare back....)  Mmm...lemon ginger whipped cream...

"event","Last night, Del and I were to see The Reduced Shakespeare Company together, doing the Complete History of America, Abridged.  (I'll see All the Great Books, Abridged, with Das tomorrow.)

I got to Walnut Creek early, to find parking, pick up tickets, etc.  I had hoped I'd have time to linger over a glass of wine before the show, and I did.  Massimo is just across the street from the theater, so I trotted over there and settled down at the bar, intending to have a quiet glass of wine while people watching and keeping one eye on the clock.

Instead, I met Bill and Marge, this cute couple who've been married for 48 years and who thought I was the greatest thing since sliced bread, LOL.  We chatted for about an hour, and Bill treated me to a glass of port, which was awfully sweet.  (The gesture, not the port).  It was all so random--we just breezed into each other's evenings and made each other smile and laugh.  Strange how something so small can make you feel like you've stumbled across a glimpse of what Life is supposed to mean.  When it was time for me to leave, Marge wouldn't let me go without a huge hug and a million kisses on my cheek--I had to check for lipstick before I left.

Del met me in the lobby of the theater, and we headed upstairs for the show.  We managed to chat a bit before it started, and it was good to see each other again.  The show itself was fantastic--those guys have a great way of making everything else disappear, and you forget about whatever was going on in your life that day.  I found myself smiling--that uncontrolled, spontaneous smiling that you do when you're genuinely happy, not just because it's polite--the whole time.  These guys are just geniuses.  I'm glad I got their autographs--I like keepsakes of things like this.

About 40 minutes into the show, the troupe cracked a couple of deliciously un-PC jokes (""Hey, you can't call a Native American woman a 'squaw.'  It's a term for a lady's...nether regions.""  ""Hey, I didn't know they were Dutch!""  ""No, not NetherLANDS--nether REGIONS.""  ""Oh, so what you're saying is, I shouldn't put my finger in a dyke."")  Within a couple of seconds, an earthquake hit.  Really.  Literally.  An earthquake--the first one I've felt in the nearly 4 years I've lived here.  The set shook, the lights shook, dust filtered down from the ceiling, our seats shook.  Del's initial response was ""Whoa, you pissed *somebody* off.""  It was a 4.2, centered in Lafayette, which is about 7 miles away from WC.  It lasted maybe 3 or 4 seconds, and I honestly thought at first that it was some sort of special effect--until I realized that my *seat* was moving.  I asked Del if that was really an earthquake, and she laughed and said, ""Oh-ho yeah.""  

What was even better (aside from finally feeling an earthquake that was cool instead of effing scary), was that it was the first one that Dominic (one of the actors) experienced, too.  Once it was confirmed that it was an earthquake, he leaped off the stage and high-fived everyone in the first row.  He was also terribly excited about the possibility of aftershocks, LOL.  A few jokes were made in reference to the quake at that point and throughout the rest of the show.  At intermission, I called my roommates and Das--the former barely felt it, and the latter told me that ""Yeah, shit moved.  I was under a table.""

Such a strange night...Making friends with strangers, meeting up with an old friend, seeing a great show, and finally ""getting"" what a quake feels like.  (Via, is it any surprise to you tha this all happened on 3/1/07?)"

"event","After the most horrendous travel SNAFUs I have ever endured, I did actually make it home.  This was after:

A BART delay, within a half a stop of SFO.  They had to shut the train down (i.e., pitch black train in a tunnel, scream) to remove debris from the track.

Departing over an hour late from SFO.  Don't ask.

Arriving at JFK at 8:06 when connecting flight scheduled to leave at 8:30.  For the first time in my life, I sprinted nearly a mile--only to find out that the airport was shut down to one runway due to fog.  Finally got on the plane around 10:30.  Then sat on the runway for over 45 minutes while a ""mechanical problem"" was fixed.  Then found out that we had to wait for FORTY SEVEN other planes to take of before we could.  At that point, I cried.

However, it was all more than worth it.  I had a wonderful time with my parents, and got to see Mathias, Beth, Raine, and Sarah.  I had missed them so much, but didn't realize just how much until each of them was hugging me.

I'm sure I will go into more detail later, but just in case life gets in the way, I'd like to say thank you to those who were able to come down and see me.  It meant so, so, so much to me.  It felt so wonderful to know that there were people there that love me, and even after 3 years (in some cases) of not seeing each other, neither time or distance mattered at all.  This was the best trip home I've had, and it broke my heart when it came time to leave.  I miss you all terribly, and I wish we could see each other more often.  And good lord, I miss your hugs...

I'll be seeing my parents in April, and I couldn't be more excited.  My dad and I have always been good, but as y'all know, my mother and I haven't.  In the past couple of years, things have gotten so much better, and our relationship is just about everything I had always wished it could be.  I love her, and I think we may even be friends now.  I was sad to leave her, and she didn't want me to go either.  We actually stood in the kitchen and hugged for a solid 5 minutes, crying, and I could tell that she didn't want to let go.  I forgive her for everything that happened before, because it doesn't matter now, and I know that through it all, she loved me and wanted the best for me.  It's a little hard to have this now that we're so far away from each other, but...I'm so happy that we do have it.

At any rate, thank you all for such a wonderful Christmas.  I love you so very much."

In my 11/05/06 entry, I mentioned finding a new and more reliable source for our employees' discounted bus tickets, as well as a considerably cheaper source for our BART tickets.  (For you East Coasters, BART is kind of like DC's Metro.)

Well, today, after having sent in the new contract for said BART tickets to our new supplier, I happily dashed off a note to the slacker jackasses we'd previously been working with.  What did this note say?  In short, ""we would like to terminate our contract, effective immediately or no later than January 13th.""  (Contractually, we should give 30 days notice, but we can mutually agree to terminate with less/no notice.)  Considering that these people continue to fuck up their finances in staggering ways, then try to lay blame on *US* for the problem, I was reeeeeally wanting to terminate ASAP.  I included a line that said, ""we would appreciate a response within 48 hours"" because these people seem to have a hard time with returning phone calls.  I'm assuming it's because they're scratching their asses with the receivers.

I sent this via email, which sounds unprofessional, but was in fact the best way to go about it.  Email can't be ""misdelivered"" or accidentally left on a fax machine for days or ""misrouted"" by whoever's in charge of delivering mail within the company.  Believe me, we've heard every excuse in the book.  The plan was to send it, and if no reply was received within 48 hours, I'd send a hardcopy on letterhead via certified mail.

I literally leaped out of my chair and cheered when a response popped up in my inbox 15 minutes later with an agreement to terminate immediately.  Yay yay yay!  Kim congratulated me on it, and we did a little dance in the hallway.

Of course, another colleague was relieved to hear the news because these arsebuckets had begun harassing *her* with the exact same nonsense they'd handed us.

Anywho...tee hee, I gave the bastards the boot, and it felt good.  Now, I stop gloating before I incite some horrific karmic backlash."

I'm debating on whether or not to pack my clothes this weekend.  If I do, I can get camera batteries charged, recharge my phone/mp3 player/DVD player during the week, and throw those in before I walk out the door.  Eh.  We'll see.  I already know that next week is going to be a hard one at work, and I'll probably just want to crash when I get home.  Especially when I've got to get up before 6 every morning, and then won't really sleep Friday night.  (It's an overnight flight.  I'm 5'9""...you know how comfy those seats are...)

The only bad thing is that we're supposed to do Xmas with my sister and my niece Saturday night...when I land (without sleep) that morning...Oh well.  I can suck it up.  I can't complain too much since I do get a day to sleep in before going back to work this time.  (I land a minute before midnight on New Year's Eve, and we have New Year's Day off...thank gawd.)

I'm rambling, but it's because I'm excited.  I think I'm most excited about the fact that I can actually give my family presents this year.  Hopefully, Mom & Dad will like the DVD player...::crossing fingers::  Also fun will be the opportunity to cook up some yummy food for them--but I don't want to go overboard.  Gotta save something for when they come to CA in the spring.

Ok...enough...I'm just babbling.  Yayyy!  A little over a week before I get to fly home, via New York.  Haven't been there yet, and I don't really think that a 2-hour layover in an airport counts as ""being there,"" but...they're bound to have windows, right?

But, I got some great stuff for my bday--and all if it was super-thoughtful, meant-just-for-me type stuff.

MIC (Del's mom) got me a sky-blue KitchenAid stand mixer.  I cried.  Now, to figure out what to make with it that doesn't require baking, since our oven doesn't work and it will be a loooong time before we get one.  I'm thinking flavored whipped cream for fruit/waffles, etc., to start with.

The roomies got me ladybug socks and frog socks and penguin socks.  I had just about resigned myself to boring socks because I could never find cute ones when I went out.  My other fun socks (monkeys, frogs, ducks, Happy Bunny) were all on their last legs...no oddly slanted pun intended.  Also, the best birthday card. EVAR.  On the front is a photo of a Hispanic man in a turquoise, sequined wrestling leotard..or maybe he's supposed to be a trapeze artist.  I don't know.  He's got his hands on his hips and is looking importantly at something in the distance.  It says ""So, you will not go to Omaha with Paco?  Paco can show you many things, but Paco will not beg.""  Tee hee.  It's funny.  Inside--""Birthday or not, don't go with Paco.""  It's funnier if you can see it.

Beff sent me a book on planting herbs (from how to put them in the ground to how to design the layout of the whole garden), a box of cards with flowers/herbs and their medicinal uses on them, a wine bottle holder, and mix to make Bermuda rum swizzles--which I'm saving until either she comes back here or we go to Bermuda together.

Dacia chose to celebrate my dorkiness and gave me a basket for my bike, a bell for my bike...and HANDLEBAR STREAMERS for my bike.  Obviously, I'm referring to my ding-ding bike instead of my vrooom-vrooom bike.  Now that I have the bell, it really *is* a ding-ding bike.

Mom & Dad sent me a check, and I put it towards getting a heart-monitor watch for the gym.  The elliptical, bike, and treadmill at the gym all have monitors on them, but the damn sensors aren't worth shit.  Either they can never get a heart rate, or they lose it halfway through, or what's showing on the screen is obviously not my actual heart rate.  (30bpm when I'm at 70rpm, 15 minutes into the workout...)

I also got a desk today, and it's reeeeeeally cool.  It's the convertible desk from Pier 1, and it's perfect for my current living situation.  It's about the size of a file cabinet, width-wise, but one side of it is on a track, so you can pull it out to a full-size, glass-topped desk.  (To check it out, just go to www.pier1.com, type in ""desk"" in the search field, and the convertible desk should be the first one on the list.)  Squee.

So, yay!  That's my birthday.  OH!  And the roomies are out right now looking for a Christmas tree!!!!!!  I haven't had a Christmas tree in my house since I moved!  ::bounce bounce::  I think it's safe to say that this is the best birthday I've had since I left Virginia.  (Nothing will top my ring-week style birthday senior year.  Ever.)  I'm so happy!!!"

"event","Soooo, we thought that the oranges on the tree were probably all rotten or dried out in the middle.  These would be the oranges that had been on the tree since APRIL, and had not gone through the ripening process due to extreme heat ('member those entries about it being 108 indoors?) and no rain.  It doesn't rain here, not even one drop, between May and October/November.  Recently, those greenish oranges started turning yellow, and then orange.  We had meant to pick them off the tree before now so the tree would be less stressed.  Just never got around to it.

And boy, am I glad.  Because those oranges are actually juuuuust fine, thank you.  Not quite as obscenely, slurpingly juicy as the previous crops, due to the lack of biblical style rain like we experienced from December-April, but still quite lovely by normal orange standards.

How fine are they, you ask?  I just went outside and picked TWENTY FIVE POUNDS OF ORANGES in less than 5 minutes.  Just the ones I could easily reach, without stretching or standing on tiptoe.  ::giggle::"

"event","...or somethin'.  Who knew?

Mmmmmmany years ago, I was the overachieving top-dog destined to wind up on the A-list.  I was, as they say, on a fast track to success.  And then, suddenly, I wasn't.  I went from being the one that exceeded expectations ad nauseum to the ho-hum girl.  It was weird, but I was ok with it because I didn't care anymore.

Fast forward to today.  My company offers a pretty damn nice transportation program to its employees (bus tickets at less than half price, BART tickets with a face value of $64 at a cost of only $18 to the employee, etc.).  We've been having serious issues with our supplier of tickets--a couple of slacker, sloppy, juvenile middle-men that have dropped the ball so many times that I'm beginning to wonder if these guys came equipped with opposable thumbs.  This has led to tickets never showing up (and hundreds of employee complaints to us, even though it's not actually our fault.)

So, I'd finally had enough and started nosing around at some other options.  Turns out, we can get obscenely better service if we just go directly to the sources for our tickets (one company does the bus tickets, the other does the rail tickets).  And it's not just the service that's better--we'll save at least $1,500 a year on the BART tickets alone.  (Which means we could've saved over $7,500 to date if we'd been using these guys from the beginning.)

I presented these two new options to our coordinator, who took it straight to the VP of HR.  The first was approved about a week ago, and I actually have next month's bus tickets already ready to go for our employees!!!  The other one was approved early this morning.  My director found out about it (and the cost savings that came with it) and actually sought me out to tell me that I had done an outstanding job and had shown ""admirable initiative.""  (Getting praise out of this woman is about as easy as getting popcorn hulls out of your gum-line.)  I guess the idea of saving $1,500 a year sounds good, but sounds even better when your company's budget is not doing as well as planned this fiscal year.  

I'll admit that I was a bit giddy about all of it, and a bit sad that this sort of thing doesn't happen to me as frequently as it did.  I think I'd like to go back to being the person of which much is expected."

Are you trying to shed 7 or 8 pounds of nuisance weight?  Tired of all those hours at the gym, careful calorie counting, and menu planning?  Is having an appetite getting in the way of your goal of a trim waistline?

Then we've got the solution for you!  It's Mystery Stomach Ailment!  MSA is the sure-fire way to rapid weight loss, with no real effort on your part.  You don't even have to get out of bed!  Forget going to the gym--taking a shower and brushing your teeth is the most physical effort you'll need to (or be able to) expend!  Appetite?  Not a problem anymore!  Just thinking about food is all it takes to activate the special formula in MSA that immediately triggers appetite-suppressing nausea and general stomach discomfort.  As an added bonus, MSA saps all of your body's energy so that, even if you should begin to feel hunger pangs (which we stress is not likely to occur!), you wouldn't be able to get up and fix any fat-forming food anyway!  Instead, you'll enjoy 12 hours of cravings-free sleep each day!

Doubtful?  How about a real-life testimonial from someone who's tried MSA, with ultimate success?  Let's hear from Chris of California:

""MSA is all it claims to be.  In just 3 days, I lost about 8 pounds.  I didn't have to go to the gym or fix any special foods.  I couldn't have if I wanted to!  I even got to catch up on several hours of sleep and had a short vacation from work.  Most of the time, I didn't feel hungry at all.  On the one morning that I did, I rolled over and fell asleep before I could get out of bed to fix breakfast!  MSA works!""

*Please note that MSA causes vomiting and other GI disturbances.  A pounding headache can sometimes occur with MSA--avoid sudden movements of the head or force-inducing actions such as coughing until headache clears.  Please do not plan any social activities while on MSA, as not all social functions include proper receptacles for the storage/clearance of vomit.  If you feel lightheaded or dizzy, lie back down.  Lightheadedness and dizziness are normal side effects of MSA and are usually easily avoided by maintaining a prone position.  MSA is not recommended for long-term use.

Mystery Stomach Ailment--the answer to your weight loss problems.  Talk with your doctor today to see if MSA is right for you."

"event","Sorry...this was supposed to get posted here on Sunday...

Blargh.

I had been very pleased with myself for having not been sick for over a year and a half--April '07 would mark two years, to be exact.  I was reeeeeally hoping to hit that two year mark, but...alas.  'Twas not to be.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm not complaining.  It was pretty kickass to go over a year and a half without being germ sick.  (Have been oogie a few times because of blood sugar, but that doesn't count.)

Needless to say, I got nailed.  Not horribly so, but bad enough to let me know that this was not just going to be a couple of days of sniffles and no missed time from work.  Hacking cough, seizing throat pain of what I assume is the glandular variety, along with regular raw, scratchy surface throat pain, loss of voice, skull-cracking fever induced headache, etc.  I slept for two days--awake long enough to get something to eat or drink, then back to bed to pass out.

I'm still tired and weak, but I should be going back to work tomorrow.  I rarely take time off, and if I do, it's only one day.  Come to think of it, the only other time I've taken off two days in a row (unscheduled) was due to the bike accident exactly one year ago...::grin::  I will say that the several days I spent at work zoned out on Vicodin were probably some of my better ones.  Mainly because I don't really remember them.  I pretty much only recall my boss pushing for me to go home...Needless to say, this go round when I called my boss and honked over the phone ""I don't think I can come in today,"" the immediate response was ""Uh, no you can't.""  

Hopefully, this is my major sickness for the season.  ::crossing fingers::  I really hope that this means I've gotten the ooginess out of the way and that I have another year and a half of good health ahead of me.  I'll spend the next few days fueling up with healthy stuff (now that I feel like eating again), and I'll try to continue my mostly healthy diet and my mostly regular trips to the gym.  That whole not smoking thing has probably helped, too.  I think I'll keep that up.

And if any of y'all are battling with that nagging cough that just won't stop, I do recommend the honey-lemon Ricola cough drops with echinacea.  They don't taste entirely vile, and they're the only cough drop I've ever taken that actually helped!

Wish me luck at work tomorrow!"

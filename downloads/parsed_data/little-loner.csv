So hopefully that won't be too bad. Well I'm all excited and shit, it's invigorating, I never get excited, but yes Katherine is finally coming up after a long ass time of well not being here. I'm gonna set something up so we can camp out, its kinda hard to figure out who to invite, but they'll come, 'cause prom night ROCKED!!! It pretty much consisted of me and kyle playing with fire... but it was still insanely fun. But yeah hopefully i can get a nice little crowd together, not too big but yeah maybe 8-12 people. well i have to get up at like 7 tomorrow... gross..."

"event","Well i haven't written in this damn thing for a long ass time, oh well. things have really started to suck here. First theres the whole being sick thing. I've had something for a long time its been about 2 months or so now. i've gone through 2 or 3 rounds of meds so far and they've done nothing... so that kinda sucks. Then theres the whole deal with my sister... again. Yeah... the time sucked pretty bad but the second time is 10 times worse easily. But yeah not much i can do about it... except maybe beat the shit out of the fucking guy! Sorry i have a little pent up anger... as usual. Anyway just thought i'd write a little something just to say i did."

"event","Well... last sunday was my birthday... it was kinda weird. I woke up and took a shower, then i just wanted to get the present thing over cause thats usually a bit tense cause my mom freaks out when i don't jump up and down when i see my present. Well i got through that i got some pretty cool stuff, i thanked everyone, then everything just stopped. It was almost like its your birthday till you open presents, then its just like ok back to normal. So i spent the rest of the day moving furniture up and down 3 flights of stairs. So i felt kinda cheated but oh well... that night i did like the most random thing... decorated gingerbread houses. It was fun, i had santa hanging from a roof. 


Well thats all i have to write.... cause i'm tired and don't feel like writing anymore."

"event","Wow... I'm really bored right now, I have no clue what i'm gonna write about, i just had to do something. I guess i can say how my family reunion went. Well basically most the adults got drunk, i ended up having to drive 4 kids around on a four wheeler for an hour and a half... yeah, as funny as those people were it was still a waste of a good afternoon. 

Oh yes, and then there was doing landscape work with my favorite dad... I basically do all the ""heavy lifting"" while he sits and works on pruning a garden while complaining about how he had to cook supper the night before. This morning i hit myself in the leg with a pick axe... another fun experience to tell my children if i ever get around to getting some. Now i feel drained and pissed and i have no idea why... oh well at least i'll be home alone tomorrow so i can sleep in."

"event","Well its finally harvest here in Northern Maine... which for 75% of the student body means sitting on our asses and doing absolutely nothing. 

My house has been quite enjoyable with my dad bitching about my sister and baby always being here when he wants to get something done. Which is every damn day but anyway. And then theres Mom who's all fucking pissed off from watching Malichia more then my sister does. Ha and then theres me who sits at the computer out my earphones on and drown out everything around me. 

Wow... i got yelled at because i was just sitting doing nothing and my then because i supposedly was not paying attention. If only they knew i stopped listening and giving a shit like 3 years ago.So basically the last couple weeks have been getting out of the house as much as possible.

 God i think i actually might have gotten straight A's in school, but just as a thought no one gives a shit. Oh well, i guess i really don't care much anyway. School is weird now, I'm still not used to not having Katherine around. Well I don't really have much else to write about."

"event","Last night was an interesting night, I was sitting talking to people online when i got the sudden urge to talk a walk for some reason (it was like 12 at the time). So i went for a walk, i went about a half a mile or so when i found probably a little group of bears... There were 2 little cubs and what I assumed to be the mother bear. Yeah that was fun. i'm lucky i can somewhat see in the dark or i would gotten mauled, lol.

Yeah... school starting in 2 days, yippy! I haven't woken up before 11 all summer (except for work) so it should be fun getting up at 6:30! Wow i'm all enthused about that... well i kinda ran out of things to write so until next time."

"event","Lol! i forgot my password so i could do this for so long... anyway i'm starting back up cause.... well i dno something to do i guess. School starts for me in less then 2 weeks... that sucks so bad. Half of why that sucks is cause when i start school i get everything taken away, meaning computer, TV, everything. So i am getting punished for something i haven't even done yet. I personally think that is sick. The other half of why that sucks is for the obvious reason... its fucking school! 

Anyway... i should probably be focusing on then more recent problems.. my moms going to visit her sister down in boston, and well my dad has a very long history of going physco everytime my mom is gone for more then a day. In this case she's gonna be gone for 5... This experience will either suck extremely bad or be extremely funny... So wish me luck, or maybe pray for me or something, lol. 

Well thats all i can think of right now..."

She's one of my cool aunts too... well i guess i can't really do anything about it now. Well on a slightly cheerier note i'm not grounded anymore... that'll last till like monday when i get my report card... hahaha that gonna be funny. I started this huge poster that i'm gonna make for my wall in my room. I'm gonna make this star thing i am always drawing. Yeah it should look pretty cool until my dad rips it down, lol. I haven't really talked to anyone since tuesday... I'm actually thinking about going to school to see some of my friends one last time before the big bad summer comes along. Yeah i feel so enthused."

"event","I have wrote a journal for awhile cause my big fat jewbag of a father kicked me off... ass. Anyway i have been distant from people for the past week, i really don't know why maybe cause its the last week and i'm trying to get my grades up past the point they need to be. Yeah just barely did that but i did do it. I punched a nice hole in one of my walls. I dno how i did it cause the damn thing it like the size of my head. Oh well my dad also cracked me in the face for that... till he saw my face and then he just slammed my door. i fixed the walls the next day it took a long ass time. My moms worried about me... i'm just worried some unexpecting jerk, or even worse, one of my guy friends is gonna mess with me at the wrong time and that hole is gonna be their face. i hope i don't go to anger management that would just piss me off even more...lol. i wonder if anyone has ever just freaked out in on of those sessions and just start like a crazy person riot, that would be fucking awesome... lol. Anyway i'm kinda tired so i'm gonna go."

"event","Oh lordie, i got in trouble for drawing on my arm... again. i've been making tatoos on myself since i was in 3rd grade, you'd think my parents would get used to it. Oh no of course not that would actually be cool. oh well the tatoo was freak'n awesome. I'm definately gonna be a tatoo artist when i get older... hahaha i can picture it now i'll have like 30 tatoos. Wow thats kinda scary. Anyway today was pretty hot, i think it hit like somewhere around the mid-80's it was weird. About a half an hour ago i was looking up guitar tabs for some incubus songs (for those who don't know thats music for guitars)anyway i was looking through when i finally relized "" i can't fucking read tabs, lol!!!"" it was pretty funny and a bit random so i thought it was funny as hell. Alright thats about it."

It would kick even more ass if every school in the U.S. hadn't finished school like 3 weeks earlier then my school did. Oh well... It surprised me how many seniors are leaving that are my friends. It kinda sucks that i'm never gonna see about 90% of them again... why the fuck is everyone leaving? Its not fair i want to leave to i hate Caribou! It kinda makes me mad that everyone is leaving me behind. I'm definitely gonna be a loner next year hahaha... This summers gonna suck pretty mad i have to help my dad work and stuff at my uncle's apartment buildings... yippy. Hahaha i got katherine a gift today for when she leaves for Rhode Island, and since she'll probably read this i'm not gonna say what it is, but i will say she's gonna like it!!! well anyway i've run out of things to type so i guess i'm done for today."

"event","Hmmm... Today was kinda weird i was extremely tired in the morning but the second i hit last period i was was flipp'n hyper. I was kicked out of French, my crazy bitch of a teacher had a short temper today and couldn't take my usual ""smart mouth"". It wasn't even my fault i was just laughing and then when she sent me out i made 1 or 2 comments and a couple choice words and BANG!!! She spazzes out. Oh well, I got grounded a week for that. I hate having parents as teachers, i can't get away with a damn thing. 
Track is finally over, it seemed it last for a half a year... oh wait my bad it fucking did!!! I have been kinda spaced out the past couple days, cause it just struck me that one of my best friends is moving and i might not see her for a long ass time... I will be very sad when she leave for good. I don't remember crying ever sence i was like 4, but this might actually be one of those time. And just to tell anyone who reads this i'm not an extremely emotional guy, some might even go as far to call me emotionally constipated, so crying would be a big thing. Anyway i am gonna try to get at least 3 hours of sleep tonight. So till i remember to do this again...

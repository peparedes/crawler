"event","So I know I don't use the old LJ very much.  I pretty much packed my bags and moved over to Myspace on account that once I put my account on private I found that the teenagers quit trying to be my friend and that I had a pretty accessible personal web page with blog.  But I do try to check for all of you still here on LJ.

Christmas and New Years were pleasant.  I chilled out with the wife and spent a few days in Shanghai playing with Isaac.  He is a lot more interactive at six months and make sounds that are like words but are not and ""plays"" with toys rather than looks at toys.  So holidays went pretty well if a bit low key this year.

The internet blew up here in China if you all hadn't heard.  More particularly the undersea cable that pipes data from abroad into the mainland blew up after an undersea earthquake near Taiwan.  Basically using any website that originates out of the mainland blows.

So I swiped this survey from Tanya.  Feel free to fill that out in comments or something.  Question 21 was changed from do you think I am attractive to do you think I would look good in drag which seemed less relevant but more interesting.

Peas

1. Ever punch someone in the face?
2. How old are you?
3. Are you single or taken?
4. Eat with your hands or utensils?
5. Do you have any recurring dreams at night?
6. Ever seen a corpse?
7. Have you ever wished someone dead?
8. Do You Like Bush, the president?
HERE COMES THE FUN ... ... ...
9. Whats your philosophy on life? and death?
10. If you could do anything with me, and have no one know about it, what would it be?
11. Do you trust the police?
12. Do you like country music?
13. What is your fondest memory of me?
14. If you could change anything about yourself would you?
15. Would you date me?
16. What do you wear to sleep?
17. Have you ever peed in a pool?
18. Would you hide evidence for me if I asked you to?
19. If I only had one day to live, what would we do together?
20. What is your favorite thing about me?
21. Do you think I would look good in drag?
22. What's your favorite color?
23. If you could bring back anyone that has passed, who would it be?
24. Tell me one interesting/odd fact about you?
25. what one question would you like to ask me? Anything!
26. Will you post this so I can fill it out for you?"

"event","So its Saturday and we have to work til three.  It's company policy.  But we get a week off starting tomorrow.  Since its saturday I came to work in vans and shorts.  Then my shoelace got stuck on the wheel of my rolling chair.  I tried to make it unstuck but I wasn't looking and it got worse.  Then whenever I tried to escape I kept dragging the chair around.  Then I remembered that standardized testing said I had a brain and untied my shoe.  Crisis averted.

I am kind of hooked on myspace right now.  Sorry loyal LJers I shouldn't play favorites with my blogs but myspace is a tad more accessible.  Since I went friends only I now no longer have prostitutes and teenagers trying to ""friend"" me.  Thank GOD!  The internet is the new brothel.

Since I last wrote here I

Had a ten year reunion.  It was hella fun.

Got married.  its been remarkably the best thing I have done in uhm ever.  Never thought I would advocate marriage but its pretty darn neat.  If you haven't done it yet it beats watching movies by yourself.  Uhmm... Wedding will be sometime next year so it's not like you all weren't invited.  Nobody but us and the legal folks were there when we signed our certificates so its not like you guys were left out.  Prolly next July or October there will be receptions in US and China and a wedding kind of thing in the maldives if you feel up to the trip.  You all were not neglected just uhm... uninformed.

I don't think Issace was born when I last posted so I should note I am also an older brother.  My brother's pic is my myspace avatar so go check it out.  Get on myspace and see all the pictures I have.

What else... I got back on USA WoW after discovering the new servers have me on yellow bar.  Huzzah for yellow bar.  It rules.  Anyway until I hit level sixty and jaded expect it to take up most of my free time.

Peace and Love"

"event","I am not sure if I feel 100% like the questions lead to valid result but as far as quizes go this one actually had a lot of thought put into it.  I like the celebrity match up.  Apparently I landed right on top of slick Willie's wife's head.  how weird is that?  But I like that Josef Stalin and Darth Vader are right next to each other on the totalitarian section.  I do think they could have inverted the chart to represent right and left poltics on their appropriate side though.  Would have been a bit more intuitive.

Still better than bad it must be a fun quiz.

"event","Man I have been dying for some counter productive behavior in the office.  In recent memory there has been no where near enough time for some well needed CPB.  Afterall this is the time I update my live journal and send e-mails.  I sooo behind in my e-mails.  I thought I was busy earlier in the year but that has nothing on the past two and a half months.

I sat down for most of today and put together a financial review of the office's performance.  We are ahead of where we need to be at six months the months May and June are the under performers of the first half of the year.  As understaffed as the Shanghai office was in the first quarter of the year they (not us as I learned this year) are never busy then so being understaffed is no big problem.  I have noticed that being understaffed in Q2 sucks my balls.  I think I have spent more than half of my office time in Shanghai or doing work for Shanghai since I have been back.  I literally worked everyday from sun up to sun down getting two projects that were not my own squared for them from the Wednesday I got back to last Sunday (roughly my first ten days back from the UK).

The end result is that this month we will do about a third of the business we did in April.  As a whole the company out performed our 2003 year in just six months.  That's great for Pro-Way but sucks for my little office as we are way too busy picking up their slack to do our own work.  Which sucks even more because my bonuses are all tied to team (i.e gz office) performance which suffers when we bail Shanghai office out.

Yes I appreciate them helping us last year.  Here is the deal for anybody who ever thinks of opening a privately owned business, unless you are in hi-tech or chemicals and you hold a patent everyone wants to use you will almost without exception lose money in your first year.  Don't try to micro-manage and prevent short term losses, instead try to invest and get money generated at the end of your first year and explode into year two and three.

Anyway I get tired of hearing people say I should be grateful that Shanghai carried us last year.  We carried them in Q1 this year so let's get over it and hire people in the central office and let my team do what it does best which is make us some money.

Yeah I am bitching but I need this so forgive me.

In other news I saw the DaVinci Code.  So what was the fuss all about?  I mean it was a neat story and the girl from Amelie was cute as the last Scion of Christ but what's the big hulla baloo?  It's a story and not even a particularly original one.  I mean if you couldn't see every plot twist coming a mile ahead of you then I guess it would be something special.  I mean come on people...

I am disappointed in America's first game in the world cup.  The line up they are running is really something special but watching the Czechs man handle us was depressing.  Team USA just wasn't hustling and the Czechs took good advantage of it.  At least our next game is against Italy.  If we let them score the first goal they are likely to take a nap and let us beat the crap out of them.  There is hope but my peeps this year's World Cup did not start with the bang I hoped for...

In reviewing X3 I noticed some rathering overwhelming plot holes.  I still thought it was good hour and forty-five minutes of non thinking action, but it required some serious not thinking to make it a lot of fun.

Please let Super Man be the last hope for Summer Blockbuster Entertainment.  I am really feeling let down.  Though I will go to Ice Age 2 tonight and I have some hopes that this will restore my faith in Hollywood.

I do not as a rule lump Clerks 2 into the Hollywood Blockbuster category and look forward to it as its own cultural event.

More pics on Myspace later tonight so keep your eyes open for it.  Huzzah for CPB!!"

"event","I finally walked of the pane and onto to Chinese soil this morning.  I have a feeling that I will be a bit of a space cadet for the next couple days but generally things seem to be looking up.  I am going back to Gunagzhou hopefully tomorrow night and I will have a weekend to be home instead of running around like anwhere that's not home dude.

I had a great time in the UK though.  The workshop in Chichester was really great.  I got a lot out of it and I was surprised by how much more I ahd to learn.  Generally there was a lot of consolidation of learning but there was a lot consolidated.  

Chichester was a really cool small town with lot's of green and sheep and stuff along those lines.  The actual workshop was held in West Dean.  This is the kind of place that Erin would pee herself if she got to visit as it literally a muesem filled with older relics, modern painting, victorian period tapestries, and plaster heads of elephants.  General curriculum is in art restoration, tapestry making, and gardening.  Despite the small campus it would be cool to study there for a semeter or two if I was only still a student.

I had a rockin' time hagning with my home boy Zack Durant in London.  He seems to really enjoy the master's course he is doing in script writing there and best of luck to him in getting his script out there.  I think I had more pints of different beer at various pubs in the last few days than in months of drinking the same beer in the same places.  Hurrah for English culture!

I also got to see Sam and Jason for the afternoon as the came down to show me around.  Due to typical rainy whether we redirected our tour to a few nice pubs and we finally found room temperature beer. Suprisingly warm beer is not all that bad...

Anyway glad to be a few steps closer to home and hopefully a more stable month of June than the last couple of months have been.

Also saw X-men 3.  As a comic book movie goes it was better than bad but not really great either.  Still for a summer movie it's a lot of fun.  I only have a hand full of movies left to watch this summer as the list of movies I would like to see is rather short... counting down to Superman, Pirates, and Clerks 2...

Among the movies I saw on the airplane I did finally get to see a good copy of Lucky Number Slevin.  It was everything the first half I saw on crappy DVD led me to believe it could be.  If you can rent this movie do it's actually fun."

I went to watch the ponies race this weekend in HK at the invite of the delightful miss Tanya.  We had a rockin' good time.

If I needed an excuse to quit playing that would have been it, that is if I didn't have a multitude of other problems that made me quit already.

"event","Well my internet crashed at work and of course the vendor was on vacation so here it late Sunday night with a few more updated thoughts.

Myspace continues to be a source of amusement and confusion as I still am not one hundred percent sure how to make it all work.  But I am slowly adding pictures to the site.  In went through all the photos I have taken since I got my camera in April of 2003 and that I thought were interesting.  I am starting with 2003 and updating from there.  So there is a good chance that many different people will be in these photos as they come up.  I will eventually add captions and give some structure to everything for a sort of photo essay of the last few years.  Smart folk maybe able to link photos to posts from June 2003 onward.

My may vacation is over and was largely characterized by rain.  And more rain.  And yet more rain. So not as much swimming as I would like.  There was however a whole lot of sleeping in and watching of movies.  Some new movies (New to me anyway) I saw and their feeback are:

King Kong: It was actually great but could have easily cut 45 minutes and been better.

The God of Cookery: Not Stephen Chow's best but an interesting portrayal of Triad and cooking culture in Hong Kong.  Given the choice though I would watch Shaolin soccer for the 17th time than watch this one for the second time. 

Volcanoe High School:  I am genearlly not a big fan of Korean live action Anime movies but this one had it's moments.  Goog movie for making a drinking game to.

The Matador:  Generally I don't like Pierce Brosnan but these movie had chuckle moments as well as some decent dialogue.  Give it a C+ maybe B-

Lucky Number Slevin: I got a bad copy but the first half was cool.  I need to keep my eyes out for a good copy.

The Pink Panther: It really is the first movie since Bowfinger where I can actually say that I really like Steve Martin as a comedian.

Arrested Development Season Three:  Why do all good things have to end?  This was the best TV series in years it's a shame so many people didn't get the beauty of it.

Firefly: Hey Joss Whedon is a bad ass, hopefully Sci-Fi or another station picks it up and finds a way to bring back the characters killed off in Serenity.  Wouldn't a kick ass Saturday night have Battle Star Gallactica and Firefly?

Myspace says I can only put up 12 picutres at a time.  Expect twelve different pictures a week from now until sometime way away in the future.

Tomorrow starts three to four weeks of my life being consumed by my work.  I'll try to keep posting and try to keep from boring you all to death."

"event","Hey there loyal readers.  It's May fourth and I am the only bastard working in at least my office building.  Since it's a work day but my official reason for working is to watch those not so ringing ""ringing telephones"" I have plenty of  time to write out what's on my mind.  Let's take a peek at what's been going on:

I have a myspace account that I will someday load some pictures onto.  I can't really figure out how to do it with live journal so, you know. I will still be using my LJ as my primary posting and blogging venue though as I have had this account for nearly three years know and actually wrote down some of my thoughts during that period of time.

I have actually been having a neat time this morning playing on Myspace.  Brent found me before I had time to get my site up and I have browsing among links to see what the six degree principle will turn up.

Work was nuts last month as I said.  This month seems to be busy but busy in that sort of I don't have to leave Guangzhou more than I am comfortable with.  I spent way too much time away from the new apartment and this vacation was a good one to bond with my home.  I finally got a chance to cook in the kitchen and enjoy the feeling on doing my own dishes.  Not that doing dishes is fun but's it's nice to know I ate off of my dishes rather than out of some styro foam container.

I decided to spring thje 1,400 RMB and buy a closthes dryer.  I am tired of constantly getting my clothes rained on or the not so sweet smell of industrial air pollution.  I can see training my maid to use it will be a challenge though.  She still gets freaked out when she hits the play button on my stereo and then can't figure out how to turn it off.  Hence why I turn of all electriccal appliances at the socket to save her the trauma.

Generally speaking though the house needs a few little things to round it out.  This takes on the aspect of owning things which I am non to comfortable with, but I have way too much stuff laying around not to own: A desk, A book shelf, and a cabinet for dishes.  When I leave China in more or less a year (likely less) I have no idea what I will do with the stuff.

I have spent most of my vacation to catch up on my sleep.  The original plan was to swim during the vacation but it has rained for most of the vacation making it hard to get out to the pool.  It seems like the rainy season this year is going to be really wet, yet another reason to invest in a clothes drier.

This vacation has been a good chance to spend a lot of time with Wang Wang around the apartment.  We spent a lot of April in seperate places which resulted in our first couple days on vacation ending in arguements that seem to be par for the course when you spend too much time apart and you are on some level as dysfunctional as we are individually.  Together we become mecha-dysfunctional Tokyo Crusher.  However the last two days of our vacation we got used to each other and found the familiar rythm of being happy together.  No matter how good your partner's Enlgish skills are there will always be misinterpretation, no matter how alike you might be the little things that piss you off about yourself are worse coming from your partner, and no matter how much I care I have a healthy reservoir of natural asshole to screw things up.  So if it took 3 days of vacation to get through all that to a happy co-existence that is not so bad.

Anyway I have to work again tomorrow so I'll write some more then.  I don't want to overwhelm everyone with my sudden chattyness.

I see I missed Ibroodnow's birthday by a day.  Ooops happy birthday!!"

For the record I did not, I was just busy.

On the upside I now know I can receive phone calls from America.  Bottom line, this last month has been tiring we generated a 2:1 return on sales and that means I am fricking spacey now.  I start a 5 day break on Saturday and then come on Thursday and Friday.  I need the time off...

Anyway I think his stance on the wire tapping is 100% correct and the fact that he is standing up against all the chicken shit democrats who would are to afraid to labeled a liberal are refusing to take a stand.

I don't care what political choice you make when you stand your ground you get more points from me than running scared.  That's why it's hard to dislike some of the passionate conservatives because they stand their ground and rally there supporters instead of asking if it would be a ""Strategic"" decision.  

I am glad some one else feels that the acts of the President are unconstitutional.  It's too bad so many of the elected democrats were elected and then left their balls at home.  It's just so damn late and a shame so few are willing to do what they feel is right."

Let's recap what's new:

New Phone: Nokia 7370 (boy design) No more busted piece of junk for me...

New Apartment: Moving closer to work and to a place with a sweet outdoor pool, Move Date: Sunday March 26 who's bringing their pickup to help me move? Best of all no f'ing hole.

New Landlord:  The old one was a piece o' keeerap the new one is by default a better one by virtue of not being living waste.

New Movies: I bought a lot recently but the ones that I thought were f'in excellent include; Good Night and Good Luck (holy crap was it good), Shuan of the Dead, Crash (I haven't seen Brokeback to compare the two, but as is it was Oscar caliber), Shaolin Soccer (for the 23rd time and it is even better than the first 22 times I watched it)

New Wallpaper and desktop theme: Penny Arcade's ""Jesus is my Guild Leader"" wallpaper with the ""Storm"" desk top theme.  Very different visually from my last desktop...

New Employee: We are so busy we needed to hire a new person.  Huzzah for busy Huzzah for competent employee!

Let's recap what's not yet changed but still the same busted up crap I had before:

Same busted up diet: Gaining weight and showing (I feel a little like a pregnant woman saying I am showing) once I get moved and put food back in the fridge there will be strict clamp down on what I am eating.

Same busted up work schedule:  Sure the new person is good but until she is trained I am still busy az AZZ.  Anybody need to work a few more unpaid hours every week?  I got some extra I can give...

Same busted up networking: I have candidates but I have yet to successfully pass over ORIENTED.  I need to I want to but I just haven't.  I want this stone off my neck...

Same busted up office supplies: We got some shitty hand me down to refit the office.  Not cool new stuff is on the way but for now it's still ""Busted Up""

Same Busted Up Idol on a one day delay:  I really am pulling for the gray haired dud and Paris but I know they'll never make it they are way too niche market.  When did I start liking Idol?  Probably when the damn hole construction in front of old apartment kept me we awake late enough to find the program on TV at Midnight...

Same Busted up Hole: Did I ever mention the f'ing hole.  The one they are digging to America in front of my apartment.  The one they bribed local officials let them continue digging until 3 or 4 in the morning.  Damn that hole is deep..."

"event","Yes it has been a long time.  Yes I do feel like I should have written before hand.  The last few weeks feel like they have been non stop.  I had a very nice trip home. I only got a fraction of the time spent visiting or calling people that I would have liked and for those of you who a meant to speak with and did not (there are many of you the Wolf family, Erin, Sophie, Chris, Jeremy etc) I wish that I had felt that I had more time that I could have freed up.  As it was I expected several long phone conversations or rap sessions and found that I was spending much of my time with my family.  In late of my grandfather's passing I felt that it was the right thing to do.  I will however, be back at the end of August for the my ten year reunion and I have told myself that I will spend that time catching up with as many people as possible and not limit that trip to family as I have my last two trips back.

I did get to hang out with both Jen, who was super cool and came down to visit, and Beth, who put me up on my last noght and got up at six in the morning to take me to the airport.  If Leon ever reads this post I accidentally ran into Sayid at El-Chico's in Norman (I didn't know he was back there but so by the way is Terry) and he said to ""Hi.""  I passed through Norman long enough to eat at the Chico and not find pants in my size.

My trip back was hellish.  I got back the long way with an overnight stay in Tokyo due to mechanical problems.  I have been wanting a vacation in Japan but not via the lay over method.  I was more distraught that I was stuck at the airport hotel and not at all packed for February in a city with a cold season.  Beyond that all I have to say is that the Customer Service branch of NWA is staffed with dumb asses who think giving out calling cards for ten minutes time in the US will be helpful if I am in Japan and have to call China.  I repeat Dumb Asses.

I got back and have faced down a terrifically busy week in which I was so busy I was unable to pay my cell phone bill until Thursday.  Or about six days after I arrived.  Ironically I lost my Sim Card somewhere between Here and Hong Kong this weekend.  At least I got to work in Hong Kong on Friday which meant Friday night and Saturday morning in Hong Kong.  Whoot!  I got a chance to Shake it up with Tanya and some of her NET pals.  They were of course super damn cool.

Now I am back in the office getting ready for a day out in meetings tomorrow.  Yeah.  I have two reports to write.  A slide show to compose to convince a clilent that our program is worth 20,000 dollars and a slide show to convince Hewitt to hurry and buy our company.  But not before july when they have to offer a decent severance package.  Apparently according to Chinese law if an employee has worked three years or more in a company you pay a lot to buy out their contract.

I also set one of these word association tests some many other people have been doing.  I went back and filled everyone's in after I saw who cool they were of Sophie's link.  so here it is

Sounds like it will be fun.  Too bad I don't giver a rat's ass about either superbowl team.  I'd like to get in touch with everybody so send me an e-mail with your phone number and I'll make time to chat.

Last night I went through a lot of my comic books from years gone by and was surprised all the stuff I had (and surprised by what I didn't have, where did all the Deadpool comics I bought in university go?)  I spent a lot of last night with the ""Comics Street guide"" trying to figure out what some of the titles were worth and if I would seriously consider selling them or if like a good book I would hold onto them to read again.  I pulled three stacks, one stack to go to the used book store, one stack to keep as reading material, and one stack to try to sell.  I found some surprising books were worth a decent chunk of cash and others that were heavily hyped in the early ninties to be approximately less than their cover value (Damn you Malibu comics!!) when I purchased them.

The find of last night was the issue of X-men that really got me collecting.  X-men 275.  God Bless you Jim Lee for being the best damn reason to get me hooked.  275 is a crucial comic because it's before covers got super shiny and special issues instead opened up into four page covers with typical Jim Lee action poses.  I was like twelve and never turned back from there.  From like '90-95 I bought a hell a lot of comics.  But if I hadn't seen 275 on the newstand at the super market I never would have gone down that road.  Anyway if any of you interested souls out there want to pay for some newar mint comics let me know before I hit the stores...

"event","I think it's weird that as a country we go to war in Iraq under the idea of promoting Democracy and Freedom and then in Palestine condemn the elections.  I think that the Hamas getting any votes is whack because you shouldn't let hate mongers decide national agenda.  BUT they election was (as far as the newspapers say) not rigged or rotten in any way.  So should the president of the United States tell a company he won't parlay with freely elected government officials.

It's like going around saying how everyone should do this one thing you really think is important.  Like say where natural fibers instead of nylon.  And then once people start catching on and everybodies in one hundred percent pima cotton, the nicest of natural fibers, be like, ""uh uhh be-yotch you look like a hood rat in that gettup, talk to the hand!""  Okay democracy is, when compared to natural fibers, a bigger choice to embrace.  So is right to call the hamas hootchie mama hoodrats since they were elected through the system we endorse?

I just want to make clear I think the Hamas party is a bunch of murdering zealots.  I don't approve of their agenda.  However, I can not simply say that all the right things about democracy should be ignored because of who was elected.  If that was the case I would be able to ignore all sorts of policy in the united states because I don't like who was elected.  Does this make sense to anyone other than me?  Does it not feel like the White house should be spending less time condemning the Hamas now that they are elected and spending mroe time tying to reform them?  It's not like the most powerful country in the world doesn't have the ability to influence these people now that they are elected and have to play nice."

"event","I thought I would write out the malaise that follows my afternoon meal.  Yesterday I was doing my thang over at the Pepsi Concentrate facilities and had some interesting trivia imparted to me.  According to the Chinese government a cola is only ever brown.  Ergo yellow drinks such as Mountain Dew and Mellow Yellow are not by legal definition Cola, while drinks like Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola, and other brown drinks are thusly labeled.

Why does this matter?  Well if you recall there are things such Pepsi Clear, Pepsi Blue, etc that have been released over the years.  All these things technically not a Cola.  So what?  Only drinks that can be called a ""Cola"" can have caffeine (it would appear that coffee is somewhat the exception to the rule, though lo it is also brown so that may help) and drinks of a non brownish nature cannot have caffeine.  Apparently semi-communist Canada applies similiar rules.  I learned all this after to my surprise I saw bottle of Mountain Dew in a refrigerator (it turns out the were of Phillipine origins) in the Quality and Technical Service area.  I was educated that there is in fact a small Mountain Dew plant in Shanghai, but the Mountain Dew they make is without caffeine!!!  Why drink it?  I mean really.

So there you have it in China Cola equals brown.  If its not brown you will not get caffeine.  Therefore certain products are bound to fail and not find market entry.  This also explains when I made a joke about penises and yellow 5 the other day nobody got it..."

What job: Business Manager - Team Development for Harthill England.
Why this job: I was on the website looking for their fax number and saw the position.  I am virtually a disciple of their leadership framework and think that the UK is nifty place with nifty people.  And I could see my value in pounds, of which I only know that sound things are often compared to the pound ergo the expression ""sound as the pound.""

Potential job repsonsibilities: 
- Develop strategy for how Harthill provides consultancy and facilitation in the feild of team development
- Develop a coherent framework of processes, tools and models that together provide an integrates appraoch to team development that is easily accessibleto clients
- Finalise the product development of the ""Exceptional Team Performance Framework"" for senior strategic teams and for project teams
- Create and lead marketing strategy for Team development
- Manage client liason/ initial sales meetings/ introduction of other harthill consultants
- Deliver minimum 30 days of team development consultancy in first year

Attributes:  Recent experience in the commericial sector either as team leader/manager or in development role that includes working with intact teams... Seeking those who are able to think and act in a commercial manner, being able to create and deliver strategy working alone and with a small team.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

This is my f%&@ing job description!!!  It's like they got my Gawddamn JD and put it on the net.  They could if we substituted the word teams with senior management fortune five hundred leaderhsip teams based in China mean me!!  It's silly really.  So here is the kicker they will pay me between 6-8 times my current salary to do the same job which after a year I do really well.  I knew there was a reason to come to China and that was to some day have a stable job doing what I love, which is my job.

In the end unless they can wait until June I can't really leave Pro-Way, but if they took an exceptional interest in me it would reassure me that the past three years have yeilded some results.  Now to start the process and determine whether or not I ahve market value.  Let the great experiment begin!"

"event","Too true too true.  My brain has officially shut down.  I am taking the next fifteen minutes before I have carry heavy stuff down stairs to try some therapeutic journal writing.  I was in the office 'til nigh until one o'clock last night finishing a work book for a brand spanking new leadership course (first time this theory has been taught by us or anyone else in China) and then this morning I had to pretend to be professional over at the offices of Pepsi and Cola.  

I like the local Pepsi people because they are in the process of localization which means the GM is going out and a new management team is coming in of locals.  Irony is I understand the new GM much better than I do the old one.  Because while the new one has perfect school house English the out going GM is a half German half Irish fellow with a penchance for saying ""Fook"" a lot.  It made this morning's meeting all the more interesting.  I agreed to provide them with an extra hour of our service in exchange for their buying us lunch next Monday.  I think I need to re-examine our rates...

Christmas came and went.  It was passable.  I had a nice Christmas party at my own apartment and got really drunk and forgot to wake the next day.  Soooo I missed boxing day shopping in Hong Kong which is in fact a tragedy.  As I was destined to lose my wallet later that same week it is for the best I didn't spend all my money at that juncture anyway.  As it is a fair bit disappeared with my wallet.  Bummer.  I now have a wallet on a chain.  Something I always wanted as a teenager and now feel fully justified in owning as an adult.

New Year's was a downer due to a death in my family.  It has not been a good year for Grandparents.  As it is though my Grandparents are all in their late 80's or were in their early ninties (except for my father's father who died ten years ago, as no one liked him much I blamed his shorter life span on being a bastard.) So I believe if you hit nine decades of good living there isn't much to regret.  Still rationallizing doesn't shake the depression, so New Year's was spent out, but unenthusiatically.

Let's see what's on the horizon.  More work than God intended for an office of three.  I think our Intern is leaving because she is just not cut out for interning, so after Chinese New Year I will be hopefully bringing another employee to share the workload and an intern to balance us all out.  But before those land mark events we must cross two more.  That's right my B-day and Chinese New Year.  This year I will be working on my birthday!  That's just great.  But I will be coming home to America at Chinese New Years.  In light of recent events I think I need to spend some time at home so for a few brief days you can all come look me up in Lawton Oklahoma.  I'll be cruising on Gore Blvd posing as a GI hoping to score with teenagers.  YEEHAW! Ahem erm well... probably not...

That's a recap.  Sorry for what I am sure are a plethora of speling and grammar errors.  My head is gone and I promise that I will write someday and make sense.  It just won't be today."

"event","I reckon I can break my own rules if I am going to complain ever so briefly about the need for Geaorge Dubbyah to do so too.  I just would like to point out that the United States created a constitution that outlined a form of government that through checks and balances protected certain basic rights of it's citizens.  Somehow or another the executive branch of or government has decided by saying its constitutional they can verbal go back and erase the fourth amendment.

Something has reversed in the thinking of the United States conservatives in the past four years.  There was a time when it was the in thing to belive in ""Freedom,"" but recently we have substituted freedom for ""safety.""  By claiming he is protecting rights by reducing freedoms and ignoring the constitution (in particularly the bill of rights ie the first ten amendments) and defending these actions as part of defending America's safety the executive branch is essentially signing away much of what is the core identity of what it is to be a part of the United States of America.  I am particularly proud of my nationality because of our defense of individual rights and civil liberties.  If I wanted to be safe I would move to Canada.

No offense Tanya and other Canadians, it's a lovely country, well in certain places...

Anyway maybe if I lived in the US of A I would be up on safety instead of freedom, but as I live in a particularly not free country with safety to spare I envy people living in the USA who have the rights our government is currently trashing.  'Nuff said."

"event","In one of those interesting turn of events that make life interesting I was left without any outgoing telecommunications last night.  I had gone to Shenzhen to explore (and put myself at risk of a knifing in the kidneys) and came back on Sunday afternoon with a cell phone that was out of power and a need to communicate with many of the good people of the world.

Suddenly I was isolated.  Through a series of events the cosmos had aligned to take away my cell phone service, my homeline, and my ADSL.  Here's how it went.

Somme time ago I left my ATM card in the machine.  This happens I am absent minded and some ATM's give the card back before the money and some cards give it back afterwards.  In the process of assuming I have my card back I have left it in no fewer than three ATMs and usually get it back that day or the next, but on that particular day I didn't notice it was missing.  I had the card cancelled and a new one ordered about two weeks ago.

Other coincidence that came to bear is the unexpected expiry of my residence permit/visa.  Which is complicated by the fact that I cannot put in a full year extension because it is tied to my work permit which expires on the first of January 2006.  I can get an extension to my work permit but it is tied to the office permit which is up for reregistry on the tenth of March.  So the relatively simple task of getting my visa updated is suddenly seriously delayed.  I should get it back on Friday.

Now until I have my passport (which is where one would find my residency permit carefully pasted inside) I have trouble getting a new card as they need me to rpesent my passport.  Aha!  So how does this tie to your telecommunications? troubles you might ask...

Well remember how my card was cancelled it just so happens that I had used the card for establishing an automatic withdrawl for my phone bill.  So Sunday I came home to a house of isolation!  What was tragic was that I had cleared my schedule to surf the net and met the unfortunate fate of watching Walking Tall featuring the Rock.  Good and Short.

I did however see a History of Violence this weekend.  At the end I felt that it was a good movie but it was one of the few movies that deserved to be longer than ninety minutes to better develop the main characters, at least a bit.  Still I liked it ALOT."

"event","So I finally got out to watch Goblet o' Fire last night and I was NOT disappointed.  When the majority of movies you watch are at home you begin to cltivate a taste for movies with story because there is only so much justice a TV can render most special effects heavy movies.  But there are times you just need to see a movie with fire breathing dragons, wizard duels, and enchanted high school dances, and for those occasions there is nothing better suited than watching on the big screen.

Having read all the books I have decided it is a very different expereince from only seeing the movies.  Wang Wang has seen all the movies now but not read any of the books.  So while I am sitting there thinking, ""oh this where they get teleported to the graveyard"" Wang Wang is actually saying out loud, ""Oh my god they're in the grave yard!""  Some how or another we both decided the movie was worth the outrageous 70 RMB we paid (seriously this is like 8 US dollars) and both had very different experiences.  I am glad I paid to see the experience instead of going for the dollar DVD option which would have been uninspiring...

1999: Thanksgiving in Florence.  Turkey sandwhich and salad.  Cheap student options, especially as I had been in Florence no more than two weeks and didn't no what options were out there other than the supermarket.

2000: Thanksgiving at home.  Yeah for Grandma's Turkey and Dressing.  The good stuff uh-huh.

2001: First Thanksgiving in Osaka.  I really don't remember what I did clearly.  This would indicate I drank ALOT.  Probably did burgers at Lani Cafe (the coolest surf bar in Sakai) with Austrian roomie carl.

2002: Dinner at Tin's Hall.  Good turkey but not enough dressing and paid about 20 bucks.  Had Erin, April and Aiko there for an Osaka family dinner.

2003: First Thanksgiving in Shanghai.  Ordered Turkey from the Ritz Carlton and had guests over.  Turkey and dressing was so-so and sharing dinner with new people not always a highlight.

2004 Second Thanksgiving in Shanghai.  This was actually about three days late as we had the big Siemens assessment and Dev Center on the actual day.  The folks over at Sette Bello's set up a special dinner and we had a good time with co-workers.

2005 First Thanksgiving in Guangzhou.  We went out and had Thanksgiving dinner at the Paddy Field.  Weird how the Irish bar was full of Germans and Europeans eating Turkey but thats how it goes sometimes.  Best value for all you can eat and some really good stuffing and mulled wine.  Good time with friends was had by all.  Small table of four in the otherwise full to capacity bar.  it's like Thanksgiving abroad has really evolved over the years to getting by to enojoying a great meal with surrogate family and good friends.

Seriously I ate so much that I was drinking the beer on tap and decided that if I put anything else in me I would puke or explode.  I love that feeling but it always prompts me to go sit on a couch and watch football.

Speaking of football the Sooners beat the crap out the Cowboys.  Whoot!

I intend to be caught up on my work by tomorrow close of business.  Then I can consider if I want to go to Shanghai for Christmas.  My instinct is no.  I really want to be in Hong Kong for Boxing Day.  I also want to put up my own tree and have friends over in my house for once.  For Egg nog..."

Tomorrow is the first ever free marketing event that my office has offered.  It's free cause I'm paying for it because the little company that we are we don't believe in spending money on marketing.  Long distance travel to far away first time meetings that may result in zippo yes but marketing events no.  So I am bringing my potential customers to me.  I think they will be pleased with what we put together for them, but I am concerned that one participant is too far beyond the rest.  She is likely far beyond my own skills and knowledge so I have to make sure I speak with care so she doesn't bust me down to piss boy for giving erroneous information.  Still the fact that she is showing up is pretty slick...

Monday we give the first of a series of four one day workshops for the Siemens Team Assistants.  And they keep adding them (team assistants that is though maybe also workshops it was originally scheduled for three we now have four and are considering a fifth).  Originally there were forteen now there are eighteen.  It's nuts.  But after this we don't have a Siemens program until January unless I sell them an office manager program in December.  But the lazy part of me would rather see that program happen in March.

Some how or another we already have people signing up for the December open course before I offer it and the course we cancelled this month is getting random people (Colgate of all people) asking us if we can do it before the year is up.  Actually no we can't, but thanks for asking.  Couldn't you have showed up to the August one we cancelled because no one was interested???

This growing interest from our friends and clients is healthy.  I have already projected that we have $12,000 booked from Siemens in 2006 with an additional $15,000 floating out there up for grabs.  Colgate still hints at doing a $30,000 project with us and the open courses seem on track to bring in $20,000 next year.  Then there are all the clients who for bizarre reasons who think First Quarter sounds like a perfectly good time to spend money on us.  I currently run the office here for less than $4,000 a month.  I think it's safe to assume that even with pay raises and maybe adding two more employees in Q1 next year I can keep it under $5,000 not counting incentive.  That seems to indicate the long awaited balanced budget and profit.  Am I the only one who thinks that this past year of frustration could result my spending the end of next year on a beach in the Maldives before going back to school?

I understand Harry Potter is even being released here this weekend.  I will put it off until next weekend as the super cool theater is directly above the mattress store.  i need a new mattress.  It can only help that my overall disposition would improve substantially if I had a nice matress to sleep.  Damn cheap landlord giving me the crappy one I have now.

Next week i moved the networking happy hour to December so I can enjoy Thanksgiving.  I will be taking Wang Wang as she really likes mashed potatoes.  Yummy... mashed potatoes.

The Haiku contest has suddenly picked up.  Next week i will announce the winner.  Who will get something better than my old crappy mattress I promise."

On the good news I booked 10,000 USD worth of contracts from Siemens for 2006.  That's about 20% of break even for the fiscal year.  So it's a relief to set that up in October of 2005.  Granted it doesn't put money on the table right now, but whatever.  In the mean time I am pushing the plan of making this little company into an institution, why are institutions so much work to make happen?

this week I haven't eaten at home all week and badly need a night at home.  So I am going to make some kind of fun for dinner (ummmm... alfredo) and watch ""The Shogun's Assassin"" to unwind.  I need some carbs and martial arts decapitation to unwind.  Think I'll get some pineapple beer for the coup de grace.

To answer Jill's question the other day, google talk is a blend of Skype and MSN supported by the good people at google.  One can google said program and voila it's on.  I think I'll see if Jason Cross is on the talk yet... I got two e-mails and he dissappeared...

Anyway I'm rambling a sure sign that I can't wait forty-five minutes to get out of here and unwind."

I haven't had the chance at home because the real world had intruded into time I like to spend online.  As it often does.  I wanted to at least see the new bow that I ahd spent one shiny gold piece on.  Truth be told I wanted to go take it and shoot it at anything for the satisfaction of seeing what my virtual shopping had netted.

Now for a little background into my time back on WOW.  I recently saw WOW on sale in the convenience store (where I buy any software naturally) for a whopping six bucks American how could I say ""no?""  Now I can read about 700 hundred characters when I am fully awake and feeling cleveer so playing this game is a linguistic hurdle that requires a lot of time looking up what things might mean on websites devoted to the game.  That being said I am having a great time playing.

Today I discovered I need to buy a dictionary.  Or expect massive losses in virtual currency.  I found out what button will taken my hard earned cash and burn it and have a stinky dwarf piss on the ashes.  If I could have read Chracters maybe I would have known not to hit the button and delete my bow (which, as I never even had it in my inventory, was like a delete one gold piece button).  I am still depressed three hours later.  I suppose I will still be depressed for a long time yet to come.

Okay the rules are simple to be considered to win a prize, no one has ever recieved a prize but the thought is there, and get the fame and glory of being the winner you must:

A. Stay on topic.  If you are off theme we will all say wow thats a great Haiku but it don't mean nothin'.
B. Be a haiku.  Seriously they're not that hard 5-7-5 people.
C. Be written then and there on the spot.  While visiting live journal not five minutes after you dig out your book of haiku's and quote from there.

"event","Today Sophie asked a favor of me, she wanted all my aiku's gathered up out of past haiku contests.  I am not sure why but it seemed an interesting task.  It seems to me that I traditionally kick off haiku contests twice a year and tis year missed the spring contest.  I think I have an excuse in that in reflecting on that period of my life I realized that during the period when my Grandmother was in the hospital I posted rarely.  It also coincided with the spring Haiku period.  Which in theory coincides with Hanami in Japan.  So as this is another of my favorite seasons in Japan (and even the best time to be in Shanghai) due to the changing maple leaves, I reckon it's time to kick off another haiku contest.

Let's see... what about a theme?  Recently I was asked to speak for five minutes on any given topic with about five minutes to prepare at a toast masters meeting.  I copped out with the cliche of surprises, so in that theme I open up the Haiku contest to contestants writing about surprises.

This one is Grandma themed

They don't know pasta
their mamas use prego, No!
why be shocked it's gross

My grandmother has shared countless stories about being offered ""Italian"" food.  As you can guess she was less than thrilled."

As I am leaving the apartment this morning and getting ready to go down the elevator, I push the botton and an astonishing thing happens as the elevator makes it's way up to the thrity-first floor.  The read out that shows me what floor the elevator is on turns off.  More specifically all the electricity in my building turns off.

Let's review what this means:  
1. I am on the thirty first floor.  I don't relish the idea of walking down the stairs.
2. This is like 8:45 in the morning the peak time for people to use the elevator.
3. All the help buttons going off at once can be heard at the thirty first floor.  It's pretty sad sounding actually.
4. I am terrified that some day they are going to turn off the electricity (for about 60 - 90 munites at a time) and I will be the sad bastard in the elevator.  Terrified...

"event","Just finished this work book that has been bleeding me dry.  No not filling it in, but in fact writing it.  My brain hurts.  I bet Willbe's brain hurts more though because she translated the thing after catching my errors.  She's pretty herpoic about those things.

Anyway I decided at best I will post once a week so I will take that post to review the at hand with some pluses and minuses.  Here we go...

Plus
I bought the super uncut DVD box set of Kill Bill 1 & 2 with sound tracks etc.  Cost 110 RMB super sweet.
Bought a ten DVD collection of Neon Genesis Evangelion (see corresponding minus)
Got to particpate in Brit Cham's Quiz night last night
Got the other half of my pay check today
Completed the slide show and work book for next weeks sales course (see corresponding minus)
Discovered Google talk has great sound quality and I will buy a head set tomorrow (sorry to Mac and Linux users eventually they will have  version for you guys too)
Wound up in Shanghai in time for Patrick's gong away party
Drank a good bottle of red wine

Minus
Sick Grandparents at home this time on the mother's side
The curse of Neon Genesis Evangelion strikes again as it's only got Nipponese Dialogue and Chinese subtitles.  My Characters are better and better but I don't think I know any characters related to giant space alien angels, teenage clones, and destructive semi-organic robots so that's a no go again...
Came in tenth out 22 at quiz night
Still have to write the case studies for the workshop
Got up early to be in Shanghai today for a meeting that got cancelled.  I now have to pass over the client when it looks like they will buy product.  buh bye commission...

Pluses seem to be winning.

In other news...

I saw this week they finally released RP PVP servers on WOWUSA.  I wish the internet could make the lag go away...
I read that the troops sent north from Mexico to help in the aftermath of Katrina are the first on American soil since Pancho Villa launched small raids into New Mexico in 1914.  How wild is that?
Tomorrow is Mid-Autumn Festival Yippee!"

"event","I just looked down to discover that not only am I wearing yesterday's pants I am also wearing part of yesterday's dinner.  If ever there was an incentive to work from my desk curry suace from the Macau Kitchen on the front of my pants is enough to stay seated.  There are time's where I wish I was more detail oriented this being one of them...

Somehow to help alleiviate te embarassment I am also the only person left in the office today.  September second saw the last day of my intern Jamie.  This meant I finally got my apartment back and I no longer have to share.  Huzzah!  On wednesday I fired my salesperson in what was my least feeling moment, but I was just getting tired of his incompetence and lack of drive.  Man I don't know when I got tired of being people without any personal initiative but recently it starts driving me up the wall.  So he's gone long story short.  I sent Jasmine to the workshop that Willbe is facilitating and my formerly five person team is down to me.  Which is fine because the last two weeks have been nuts and I have way too much to do to play the role of team leader today.

Last week my old man turned a whooping 61 years old.  I am amazed by both of my parents resilience if they are a benchmark of what I will be like at sixty I can look forward to being one of those very very active people well into retirement years and beyond.  For all the little quirks in my genetic code it is good to know that there are some very strong and use longevity genes.  Of course this meant going back to Shanghai for the party and all the relevant work that I can put together for a trip back the ""big city.""  My little city of about ten million always seems so small in comparison to the nearly twenty million people who make Shanghai silly large.  it feels almost like I am going back to this slow laid back country pace everytime I come back from Shanghai.  Anyway that represented neraly a week a way from my desk.  The paper work mounted.

At the beginning of this week I found myself pulling a marathon of business meetings in Hong Kong.  I will state here without any doubt in my mind of all of the city's in Asia Hong Kong is bar none the best city to live in or live near.  Tokyo is too crowded, Shanghai is too dirty, and everywhere else lacks the level of international uhm... ness that one experiences in Hong Kong.  If I could pick one grip it would be that there is simply not enough live music in the form of second and third tier musicians.  Anyway there was another two days worth of desk work piling up.  By now my to do list is very strong.

Wednesday i came back for my first full day at the office in like 10 days.  I get to start the day by firing Gawain.  I would have felt a lot worse about the process except that as he leaves he turns and says, ""I have been trying to immigrate to Canada so maybe I didn't focus enough on work while I was here.""  You know what I don't need? A F%@$ing excuse AFTER I fire him.  To quote my old university room mate Nick, ""Hey man it's your shit, should I have to pick up your shit? No, pick up your own shit!""  So my hope is that somewhere down the line he starts taking responsibility for being useless or he will never reach any kind of potential of uhm non useless uhm ness...

Wednesday was a pretty prductive day on the meeting, report, and proposal writing front.  Yesterday I helped chase after the details for the workshop today.  That consumed most of my time but we wound up with nine attendees and Jasmine to make a nice sized class room.  I feel a bit guilty because for me this course is all about getting GE a demo so they'll finish the procecss of using us as a preferred vendor.  Which I wouldn't carer about so much except for the fact that if we start making the money happen here things in Guangzhou are going tank fast.  So now it's today and as I catch up on everything here it looks like there is a chance for things to turn around but not if I don't catch up on this to do list.

So now it's time to do the to dos..."

"event","Any body remember the episode of South park where the Sundance film festival moves to South Park.  When asked what independent films are Cartman says something like independent films are all about, ""gay cowboys eating pudding"" and it turns he's at least partially right.  Witness this write up about the cinematic excitement at Toronto Film festival this year:

Focus will unveil two festival films expected to be players come Oscar time. Pride & Prejudice, due Nov. 18 with Keira Knightley as Jane Austen's feisty heroine, couldn't be more academy-flirty. But Brokeback Mountain, the Dec. 9 genre buster about gay cowboys (Jake Gyllenhaal, Heath Ledger) in love, could greatly benefit from a trot around the festival track.

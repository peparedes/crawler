"event","Hey I know I haven't updated in a while, but don't worry nothing's wrong (I know I have a habbit of only updateing when I am ""in crisis) but be not afeared, all is good, I am just trying somehthing new.  I though to myself, ""self, you need a place where you can express what ever it is that is going on inside your head, since right now only one person seems to really understand, but they are not here right now and you get the feeling that people around you don't like the fact that this specific person is the only one right now""  I'm sorry, I can't help that.  But I am on a break for myself right now and will not forget that, I have a lot to workout with myself and I have to get myself more first before this other person can, or if she even wants too.  Okay, I don't really know what I am talking about anymore.  Talk to you tomarrow

Sunday met Alaina (long story so comment if you want to here about it), then had lunch with her on Monday, saw her again on Thursday at Gregory Douglus, and I might see her tomarrow also.  Granted I don't know her, but whatever.  today went to support A. Gallo at the ""hearing"".  Went to see Rent tonight but first I couldn't get out of Rodman's car ( I was trapped) IT WAS AMAZING, even though they changed a lot from the original."

You are the most compassionate of all types and connect with others easily.
Your heart tends to rule you. You can't make decisions without considering feelings.

You seek out other empathetic people to befriend.
Truth and authenticity matters in your friendships.

In love, you give everything you have to relationships. You fall in love easily.

At work, you crave personal expression and meaning in your career.

With others, you communicate well. You can spend all night talking with someone.

As far as your looks go, you've likely taken the time to develop your own personal style.

Then someone spit on me from the escolater.  We leave and my phone falls out of the car and onto the highway.  IT STILL TURNS ON, but I have no servise so no one can call me and I can not call anyone.  Then we missed the exit.  But I am going to pride tomarrow and hopefully will get the phone fixed."

I don't know which is worse, being on or off the high.  Sometimes I feel like I need it or else I am not going to make it through the day.  That is where my sponser comes in.  She is better then the last one.  I feel like I can connect with her more then my last one.  I am leading a meeting on saturday.  I don't really know hwat I am going to talk about since I am so new, but I know that I have to continue to be abstanent in order to lead it.  I guess I can't grasp the idea that I have a disease, I thought I was done with all that.  I don't know if I can live the rest of my life abstanent, but I know that I can do it today.  Tomarrow is nother day and I will let you know how it goes."

"event","today/yesterday (I don't really remember now) Hayley and I went down town and had an amazing day just walking around and looking at puppies.  we went and looked in all different stores and say kristen along the way and she told us about the dress that she is wearing to prom that is on saturday (I am so excited about prom becasue SHE SAID YES).  I had this great idea that that we should go to the alanna student center and do some work, and we have been here since around 10pm.  we were so tired that we decided to stay here for the night and I woke up at six (hayley stayed up all night) and sometime before that, we baked and it was great.  I registered for classes this morning and i have gone completely insane becasue my schedule is so tight I don't know what I am going to do.  i have organic chemistry that ends at 11 one monday, wednesday, friday.  and then right afterwards at 11:15 I have biology lecture then a biology lab on monday.  on tuesday, thursday i have zoo's and exotics that ends at 10:45 and I have atatomy and physiology of domesticated animals right afterwards @ 11. then I have a chem lab from 2 to 4:45.  Wednesday i have a anatomy lab @ 1:25.  So on the bright side I only have to get through monday, tuesday and wednesday every week for every week of the semester."

"event","For people that know me well, it takes a lot to happen for me to actually sit down and write a journal entry.  So lets see where do I begin.  I got home Friday and the first thing my mom says to me is that I smell so bad that she has to spray the room because I smelled so bad, so, then it gets better, she went so far as to tell me that ""maybe we need to keep you home for the next semester so we can work on this isssue becuase we don't want you to be so far gone that we can't help you.""  This is all about control, she has to be in control at all times.  She just needs to let me fly or I will run and most likely crash.  I will admit it, I don't shower everyday because it is something that she can not control.  Then my dad almost made me have a car accident because he started yelling at me on the highway.  After lunch I had to go to the emergency room because I though my appendix was being stupid.  Then went home after finding out I had a stupid blatter infection with some medication."

"event","I have been so frustrated with everything and everyone lately.  So I decided to write a poem because that is just what I do.

                                        I wish I wasn't
I wish i wasn't so afraid,
I just want to be held,
Cradled like a baby.
BUT, thats not me, is it?
In you eyes I'm this strong angry black lesbian who never crys.
I cry too.
I cry so hard sometimes that I shake.
Only in the bathroom, out of sight.
Still have my wall up, 
So strong that sometimes it prevents breathing.
And whats more, I don't fit anywhere.
Not enough for some, but too much for others.
I am their meat in canine jaws being ripped from end to end.
IMOBILE. 
Now I've found you've joined them,
But still want to save me.
You have to pick  you can't fight for me 
then turn around and feed your cannibal desires.
Don't you understand how hard it is,
To go from here to there and back again.
I tell myself to breath,
JUST BREATH.
Let down the gates,
But every time, its destroyed
And built up, even stronger then before.
I can't keep choking.
One day,
The wall will fall."

"event","I just can't do this any more.  Last night I had like my 10 nervous breakdown of the semester, and I realized if I am getting so freaked out now, what an i going to be like in vet school, not even that, but trying to get into vet school, I realized thta I would drive myself into a further depression if I continue on this path, so I have decided to change my major from prevet to just a general animal science.  I know what you are probably thinking, a cop out right, WRONG, I will still have/work with animals, just not the way I though since I was four.  Unfortionately, eventhough I know this, I still feel increadably guilty, not sure if that is the right word to describe how I am feeling right now but it will have to do.  Yeah, I feel guilty, i guess because I kept telling myself that I was going to do well and I was going to enjoy it (WORNG, WRONG, AND WRONG AGAIN). well untill next time. . . . . ."

I have been wating for a while now for somehting that I like to open up (don't want to go from bad to worse) so i am going to move into the BASIC suite in L&L.  So excited (except for moving all my stuff because I have a lot).  



The parents are coming up this coming weekend to help with the move.  i swear I have a mother disease . . . explanation -I have to tell my mother EVERYTHING.  Bad idea.



Went on the Free to Be retreat this weekend.  Had a blast.  Picked apples, climed trees.  had a blast


I truely understand chemistry for the first time this entire semester



Last weekend went home and saw people.  megan and spencer, you rock, had a lot of fun listening to the debate.  ""I Bush and I speak English good"".

"event","I am sitting in my room right now, next to my roommate and it is not very comforable.  I was just glancing at my calender and I realized that I have a lot to go for next week.  I am going home on thursday though.  I get to see my dog and finally get some SLEEP.  its really really sad, I like to sleep more then I like to see people.  don't get me wrong, I like to see people too, I would just rather be sleeping, not worrying about stuff.  When I sleep, I'm talking about the good sleep (the kind where your mind doesn't think about anything but happy thoughts, I feel so at peice.  I would like to have that feeling when I am away, but I geuss I can't have the best of both worlds.  I actually think I am starting to slip into some sort of a depression because i don't really want to do much of anything or see that many people any more.  But the weird part is that when I do see people that I have a good time with I wonder why it took me so long to get out of my room and actually do something.  It might have something to do with me not being around animals.  I have been so busy lately that the only animal contact that I have had (besides the animal shelter, which rocked :), has been in my animal science lab.  I don't have it this week and I am sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo upset.  I might just sneak down to the farm and either poke my head around or just be invisible.  I am good at being invisible.  I think it is one of the things that I do best.  


Something really, really scared me today.  I almost had a relapse in the bathroom after my animal science.  I have decided that having a knife around my neck is not a good idea, at least not right now.  I Should be happy, and I am. I can't really explain it because I am not sad.  I can be laughing one minute and the next feel like crying and I don't know who even cares.  But thats the thing, if someone did care, I would never be the person to tell them ""Look, I feel like I'm going crazy, happy one minute, on the brink of tears the next, what the hell is wrong with me""

Another thing. I have got to stop lying, I am really trying to work on it.  I think this time though, I have lyed so much that it is going to back fire.  I like her a lot, but I lied and I can't face her now to tell her that I lied, but I don't want to keep lying to her.

I felt so bad, I made Suzie get up early on sunday to meet my parents.  the worst part was the night before I thought I was talking to Alex (I don't have any excuse, oh yeah, except my dislexia and both of their ims start with a T) who never did get to meet my parents.  I'm not sure what Suzi is feeling, haven't seen her since sunday.  I am going to get ""IT"" for her.  I am the type of person who will do everything for a person they like (except do anything direct because i am afriad of rejection).  I want her to like me so much, but people like who they like, and as much as that sucks, I can't change that (even thought I don't know who she like, but I'm pretty sure that its not me).

"event","Sunday I had one of the best days in a long time.  First it didn't start out that well because I was doing chemistry from like 11 untill 3:15.  Then I realized that there was a Gay Picnic going on that day.  I definately needed a break from chemistry.  I got to color posters (a big stress reliever), and as an added bonus I met this amazing girl.  Her and I talked for a while untill they started cleaning up the picnic (a sure indicater that we should leave) and I go inside to go to the bathroom.  When I come back out she is gone, but I do remeber her saying that she was going to get coffee and where so I go looking for her.  By now we are so far from each other that I can't yell (don't want people thinking I'm weird now) but I thought that I saw her go around the building and I knew where she lived (she told me I'm not a stalker, I swear) so I causually started walking by there and ""accidentally"" bumped into her.  Somehow, I ended up in her room and I got to play with her bunny rabbit (you know the one with fur) all while we were talking, I kept halving these thoughts of what it would be like to date her.  When we finnally realized that we were both starving, all the dinning halls were closed except for one so we walk and talk some more.  We get food and talk some more.  I still don't know if I should ask her out.  I guess I am just a bit intimidated because the last girlfriend left me for a boy.  I'm still trying to get over that.  The ironic thing is that her ex girlfriend left her and then started dating a boy too, Jon I think his name is.  Then, one of my great friends from home (who I have liked a lot for a while now) is telling me that she is a bit confussed, this is putting me in a very back and forth position.  Even more ironically, Sussi's friend from home says that she likes her too.  I jsut think it is weird that we are going through the same thing.  At least I will be able to get some sleep this weekend as my roommate is sleeping over the French house.  I honestly think that she has the hots for tom but whatever works for her."

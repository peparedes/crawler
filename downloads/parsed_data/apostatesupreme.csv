"event","<div class=""ljcut"">1. From Lucifer's first day on Earth (27-28):<br /><i><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, incarnation. The angelic drug of choice. Unlike cocaine, not to be sniffed at. I look back on my first hours here much as the mature artist looks back at his youthful creations: with a teary mixture of embarrassment and nostalgia. I was, I'm afraid (is this the admission of an Archangel consumed by pride?) in a shocking state of hypersensitivity and gaucheness. You've got to laugh, really. (Which, incidentally, is how I'd thought of opening what turned out to be my 'Hail horrors' speech, until a more scrupulous examination of the chances of actually getting a laugh changed my mind.) I </i>do <i>laugh, in hindsight, at the rattlebag schizophrenia, Tourette's and satyriasis I must have seemed during those debut hours.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  I have, as I said, tried it before, but never with licence. (Adolescents and pre-menstruals are useful. The mentally ill. Anyone stricken with grief or love. Your ideal possession candidate's a thirteen-year-old recently orphaned shizophrenic girl three days away from her period on her way to see the shrink with whom she's romantically besotted.) Former takeovers, then, have left me dressed in a set of clothes and shoes two sizes too small in a room the dimensions of which forbid ever standing or lying unbent, with laryngitis, heat rash, mumps, scrofula, gonorrhea -- you get the picture. This, on the other hand, this taking of a body without force or fear, wrapped me in a stole of material luxury the like of which I'd never imagined -- and believe me, I've imagined quite a bit.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  I entered where Gunn had exited: reclining in a tepid bath. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The feeling of entry... let me see... </i>sinking upwards<i>. Think of a gradual congregation of spiritual atoms, the adherence of each to each a contained ecstasy, the completed amalgam -- me, entered in the Flesh -- a throbbing and protracted orgasm that believe it or not had me oooohing and aaaahing and not quite knowing what to do with my newly acquired limbs, the way one of Betjeman's tennis girls -- </i>bountiful Pam<i> or whoever -- would have carried on, I imagine, had you ever got her away from the court, prised her fingers from that Wilson's damp grip, and stormed those rhododendron-like tennis knickers. It felt like (that 'like' again. Maddeningly not the thing itself...) breathing a heavy aphrodisiac gas. A terrible comfort, a saturation with both pleasure and endless desire. Welcome, Lucifer, to the concussive world of matter.</i><br /><br />2. Lucifer's thoughts on angels having their way with mortals (58-59):<br /><br /><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  I should explain. It's been a problem, this business of angels having sex with mortal women. Not that all angels are straight: Uriel's queer as a cat-fart; so are Busasejal and Ezequeel, or Eezaqueen as we call him, to mention but three of thousands. Most of us, when it comes down to it, will enjoy carnal congress with the ladies </i>and <i>the gents. Same goes for you, really -- boarding school, stir, Navy -- just needs the right conditions to bring it out. Plus, queer consorting has one huge advantage over straight action: no </i>issue.<i><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; says Genesis 6:2. The 'sons of God' were angels. My lot (</i>His <i>lot acquired neither the taste nor the opportunity); the 'daughters of men' were, naturally, mortal women. What you're looking at here -- though no one seems to notice -- is crazy copulation between renegade angels and up-for-it earth girls. A </i>pack<i> of trouble. There are two ways of having it off with mortals. The first is incubism (a word you haven't invented yet but certainly should have, given the amount of humping we've done), the second possession. With incubism, the angel </i>stays <i>an angel; with possession, the angel slips into a human host to get the job done. Incubism's decaf, possession's full roast. You lot do it with each other and half the time barely feel a thing. When we get involved... </i>wah.<i> Gives me goosebumps just thinking about it. But as I've said, possession's no mean trick. Incubism, on the other hand, was something most of the fallen could turn their hands to, and was still popular despite its want of salt. The girls seemed to enjoy it too, though they went through the whole business somnambulistically, waking flushed and guilty -- 'you wouldn't </i>believe<i> the dream I had last night, Marj...' -- not to mention the risk they ran of being burned at the stake if word got out.</i><br /></div>"

Not terribly. If I happened to spot the odd passerby in the midst of passion, I doubt she'd fault me terribly for keeping it to myself while we fucked to our hearts' content.<br /><br />I answered her kiss with a growl and a grin, only just teasing the edges of her salty lips with my tongue before squeezing my arm against her, waggling an eyebrow, and twisting round to drag her down with me into the shallow water with a raucous <i>splash.</i>"

Therefore, if you'd like your pup to take some friendly tormenting from the Devil and don't mind him knowing their most intimate secrets, go ahead and list any relevant details you might think of here. Those he doesn't know will likely be mistaken for their PBs, though this won't entail any canon puncture without permission. Naturally."

'<i>Trust</i> me,' I said. And with that bite of wisdom, I propelled the both of us outside."

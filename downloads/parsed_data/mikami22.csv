Matt and I finally realized the obvious. But he's an awesome friend. I'm never online anymore, Ron and I live together. I've really found myself in a good place right now, and I love it. I've made so many close and awesome friends. Things are finally starting to go right around here.

So well in fact, that I can't seem to keep this updated. I go on myspace mostly, so you'll catch all the current stuff there if ya need me. Even though I don't think anyone reads this anymore. But just in case. 

Word.

*final thought* I heart Theatre."

"event","...I suck at this game. The game called ""updation"".

Everyone's gone! It's like a deserted wasteland with haystacks blowing in the wind. It's like being pushed over a cliff by a suicidal Mickey Mouse! (Thanks Maureen)

It's the me and Jayme show for the time being! I think everyone else took off.

Andrew wasn't ready to leave. Well, maybe he was ready to leave the cape, but not me! I'll always be the ""villain"". And Costa, well now that he's a porn model, he's too good for the cape! HA! Well, don't worry. The new issue of Boink! is going up on my wall...

And Matt. You better be coming back where you belong real soon. This long distance thing never works. Ever! Ask Evan. He knows all about the failure on that mess. 

And Carlos- you're not too popular to call me! You even have your own ringtone, how badass is that?!

Joe and I (and maybe Matt) will probably be going to the ren faire again this weekend (nudges Jayme, Cenia, Chris, Cece). Who wants in?

p.s. I have an obsession with Rent. I go into rehab soon..."

"event","It's been a long time (for me anyway) with an update, but lately things have been hectic. Most of my time has been dedicated to the summer version of the panama club. SOme of the new people are pretty cool. There are some changes being made that I don't like, but hey, that's theater for ya. One girl may not be showing up (I know she will), but just in case, I am now an understudy for one of the trio song and dance numbers. I encourage everyone to come and laugh at my lack of experience. Although we are still missing crucial people, and we are still in the threat of being cancelled. We need more male talent on the cape.

Matt's started work at Best Buy and it's fun teaching him all the in's and out's. He's still leaving though, in September. But I guess we are going to Disney in late September. Getting the time off probably won't be a problem, since I think I'm taking a school semester off, or two, or all of them, seeing as how they cut the funding for my financial aid, and I need to do some saving up. I'm not even sure I want the degree for Liberal Arts; it doesn't even specialize in theater, and it's not like I could afford a four year big fuck off school anyway. Paid gigs are poping up more and more anyway, I just need to find them over the next year. 

Try watching a movie like ""the attic expeditions"", a low budget, confusing I have no grasp on my perception and I don't know what's real kinda thing, and watch it when you have a huge headache (or tripping on acid if that's your thing) at 3 in the morning. Then get up and calmly go to the fridge. I had the wonderful experience of altering my own reality, freaking myself out, and immediately wanting to jump in my car and drive around til I passed out into a tree. Almost the same feeling after ""requiem for a dream"" when you wanna put a bullet in your head, or ""the crow"" when you wanna kill people, but way more intense. It was a more whacked out feeling then when I got wasted at Cece's grad party, which swore me off alcohol for good.

Side note: I wanna be an O-town girl in sin city. I would own the city, get to play with guns and kill bad boys, and I could get laid all the time. Perfect job for a nymph like me. It makes me wanna cry...

I finally ordered Settlers of Catan, and I'm starting an ebay account. I'm trying to remedy my brain disease of buying dvd's. I'll get it started soon. I never have any time. 

While postering yesterday, Matt took me into Lavender Moon and made me point out every ring that I liked. He quoted ""I need to come here more often"". This is payback for all the times I bought him random things. Now that he's got a paycheck, he's returning the favor.

I wanna go to Six Flags next Saturday and I want people to go with me. If you are interested, let me know soon. I'm planning to carpool.

I need to get ready for a barbecue. I'm not sure how many people are still listening, and if I should keep updating. If you can hear me, let me know."

I'd say come see it because it's kickass, but we've already sold out tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday. Maybe you can reserve tickets for next week!

I need to be on my game tonight. My vocal teacher (and Matt's and Costa's) is coming tonight, and he rocks. I need to be extra funny to make up for my lack of singing. 

And my family is coming the following Saturday, on what would have been my Godfather's birthday. I'll have no problem crying that night, but it'll have to be my best showing yet.

"event","Ok I need to vent. If you don't want to hear a sad emo girl and her pathetic rant, turn away from this page, and get the fuck out of my sight. If you don't want to read this, chances are I don't want you reading it anyway. Warning: I am highly depressed, very emo, and this needs to come out in writing. You've been warned.






I hate how everything is turning out right now. I have exactly a month and a half in counting before Matt moves away. It bothers me every night, the thought of what I'm going to do, and how I can't come up with a decent plan that I'm 100 percent happy with. The feeling just sucks, plain and simple. Crying myself to sleep isn't getting me anywhere, and crying alone doesn't help me much either. I can honestly say that i am completely satisfied by every aspect of this relationship, and we're past the 3 month paradise blinding mark. I don't want to throw this away, just because of a 5 hour distance factor. But my track record on distance is  outright disgusting. I could just move with them, and continue for a bachelor's, as well as a new line of work which I desperately need. 

But that poses the other horrible side of the spectrum. I lived here my entire life. Everything I know and everyone I care about is within arms length of me. I don't do well with change, and I don't know if I could mentally survive a change in EVERYTHING around me. As much as I want to, I'm scared to death of it. 

I love Matt, and I know he loves me, but I don't want to hold him back from anything and I DON'T want to lose him, and I don't care how selfish that sounds. There's always been something missing or something wrong with everyone I've dated, and the only flaw in this one is how to start a future with someone so far away. I feel like I'm being cursed on purpose, because i've found something that i'm so happy with. That's what life does, when everything is going your way, life snatches something away and screams ""fuck you! Nobody is allowed to be happy in this place. That's why that jerk ate the apple, so everyone here will always be miserable"". It's fucking true. Everytime something is going your way, someone will die, or you'll find out you were wrong in the first place about how you felt, or someone comes into your life to fuck it up, or you lose your job, or someone is there to tell you how fucking stupid you are. Something, anything to fuck with you just a little, but to give your happy life a hardcore 180 in the wrong direction. 

I was happy, I got into the place, I had a boyfriend who loved me and we'd have a wonderful couple months together and I have an amazing best friend who's always there to cheer me up. And life said, ""Fuck you, kill her uncle/godfather to shake her up a bit"". Then I got to spend the next few days seeing the family I love cry their hearts out because for most of them, it was their father that died. It hurt a lot. A fucking lot. And all my hopes of packing up and heading to NY with a smile on my face were twisted until they bled. I saw the faces of every person I don't want to leave, and me not being there and the idea hurt. And I took that same sceneario, kept me with all those faces and in my mind, taking Matt out of the picture, and it hurt even more. He was the only one that stopped the tears on those horrible days, and I didn't want him to leave. I still don't, but I have no power in this world, or probably any world for that matter.

Every night I would cry alone, not telling anyone, hoping that the answer will just come to me one night, and I would just know it was the right decision. But I don't know what's right, and I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing. And I get a call from my best friend who says she's in the same exact situation I'm in. THE SAME FUCKING ONE. You know, the scenario where the person you love more then anything in the world is moving far, far away. And you can't do a fucking thing in the world. No no, no no NO! What the fuck?! I don't wish this pain on you Jayme, this hurts more then anything in the world and I DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL THIS SEARING PAIN! Oh God, why would you do this to her too? I'm the one who's hurting, don't bring her into this world. FUCK...

I'm sorry you know what this is like Jayme, I'm sorry you can feel what I feel. 

I feel dizzy. i don't remember what else I needed to say. I think I'm losing my semi grasp on sanity. Just make it stop. What am I supposed to do? What is the correct answer?! Oh God, please make this stop...."

"event","So I obviously still have no internet, and I hate it. I'm at the school of all places typing this. The play is over now and was very successful. I made so many awesome friends and I hate to see it end, even though it was a lot of hard work. I'm sorry to Costa for the misunderstandings we had, but you definetly got me back my chopping my head off. The best thing you can do after a successful performance is to have a hardcore lightsaber battle with the coolest people in the world (Matt, Costa, Dan, Kim, and Aisling). I had the best death scene the other night. I was fighting Costa and I blocked left, but he faked out and attacked right. He slammed me right on my jawbone. In shock, I turned away from him and fell backwards, and he immediately caught me in his arms and lowered me to the ground. Then followed up with ""Matt take her, I cut her head off!"". It was one of the coolest nights of my life, even if we were kids playing with toys.

But with every death, comes new life. When this all began, I had a rough time with the Erik breakup. I came to rehearsal crying on occasion, and certain people were always there to talk me out of it and cheer me up again. I told Cece how much she helped me become Sarah Atkins, and I made her cry. It was an awesome feeling. But there was always one person who I felt i could turn to, and at the time, I only thought of him as a ""buddy"" as i stated earlier. One day i even announced to him that I liked someone and i think I'm moving on, and his reply was ""I thouhgt I was too, but I didn't get there in time"". This line triggered the wheels to turn; was he talking about me? Could he actually like me? How do i really feel about him? The questions were answered when I drove him home one night singing phantom of the opera, and he mesmerized me with his beautiful voice, and I instantly knew i liked him. I didn't keep it a secret long; because he soon told me he was falling in love with me, and I already knew i felt the same way about him. We've been together ever since. I never thought I could feel this emotion so strongly, ever since i lost it 7 years ago. I haven't cared for someone this much in a long time. I'm so afraid, because he makes me so happy and I'm not used to it at all. I know you may never read this, but Matt, I love you so much. Thank you so much for being you. 

I apologize to the one person that I know this entry will hurt. I never planned for this to happen, and I know how you feel. I will always be your friend if you want to talk. I'm sorry things couldn't have been different for you. I am a little disappointed that you posted your feelings, because you always told me you never did that, so i know you only did it so I would read it, and that hurts. Understand that I never meant to hurt you, and that we could never work out, based on our life goals. Rumor's right though. Don't be angry it's over, be happy when you look back on it. You know where I am if you ever want to talk again.

Side note: I can't wait to drop down from leadership. I have big plans for myself and the theater. Unfortunately, I'm being forced to audition for a musical next semester. We can't all be gifted like my love is..."

Dracula, the love vampire. Big friggin surprise.

I feel like death this morning. I think it's allergies, my head feels like it's going to explode. Needless to say, I skipped my dance class. I can't call in to work though cuz then someone will get screwed over. Hopefully I can find the tylenol in this house.

I've started rehersals for the play. Yea, I'm the older woman, the invalid, stuck in a wheelchair. At least I can't trip over the stage this time. But I am in the hands of Cece for my main scene, and she's already told me how we're gonna pop wheelies backstage, and she's gonna accidently wheel me into the stairwell so the thing flips and I can learn to fly. weeee! This will be fun though. The entire cast is under 25, and i've got Matt with me. Matt's my alltime buddy for this play, and we share the ""I'm only in 1 or 2 scenes"" catagory. Mike brings that up a lot and hurts Matt's feelings, so I get to be the consoler. Yesterday seemed to be ""pick on the supporting actors day"" for Mike. But it's all very humorous, and the cast definetly rocks. Of course, there are 3 girls including myself, two 7 year olds, and 5 guys. One guy has to call me a black cow in the play, and apologizes for it each time. Last rehersal, he couldn't even get the words out cuz I was standing near him. Another guy directed one of his lines towards me, in which he said ""let's show mama what a good little girl you can be"", to which he got smacked in the chest with my script. It's a really fun bunch, and it's going to be a very interesting 2 months.

There was also a very intriguing lunch yesterday. I found out I'm not a hubcap girl. Tiki, i still owe you a hit for that. I know you're reading this, you already fessed up to it! There was an interesting comment I noticed involving a spoon, but I won't go there just yet. I don't like getting my hopes up for nothing. I'll keep quiet until I can figure more out.

Boo to feeling sick and not sticking to schedules..."

It was so cool and I wasn't afraid of heights like usual. This guy drives sports cars, flies planes, and fixes commputers. I have yet to find something he can't do. 

King Richard's Faire rocked as well, I even bought a dress with a bodice. I think the Janus Players are arranging a trip there. My buddy Garth works there and does a great Russian act.

I really don't have an entry, I just needed to get some stuff out. I won't actually be able to write an entry until something big happens like me getting my roommate back so I can get my own place, or if I get the big part during the audition Friday night.

"event","First off, I can't beleive Evan got his license! Good job crazy, I thought it was never going to happen. Yay for you. And for the record, I never went to fire and ice that day, so I still never have gone.

I miss Amanda and Rumor (yes, that's your name). They haven't been gone a week, and it's still too quiet on cape. I hope I see you guys again real soon, you rock.

School starts tomorrow, and I'm so excited to meet new people. I need to get out more and see the world a bit. I've been feeling kinda bored lately with only a job.

And speaking of jobs, at this very moment I don't have one. I couldn't do it at FYE. It didn't feel like home, I got sick even standing there. I walked out and left a ""i'm peacing out"" note on the desk. Bubba and I are going to work together today on tweaking my termination in the Best Buy system. We've discussed that I could be a part time rep 2 and work against a smaller availability, that way I can dedicate myself to theater this semester. I'm really excited now and I know I made the right decision, and it's a good feeling.

My aunt invited me to stay at her place so I don't have to drive all the way from Wareham to go to school and (hopefully) work. I want to at least see where my parents are living for 3 months. If it's nice, I'll want to stay with her. I want to at least see all my options before making a decision.

I tried to make communication with Erik last night as well; bad idea he's still pissed. I really thought breaking the line of communication was a bad idea, but maybe at this point he's right. Maybe it's just better to stay out of each others way. 

Well, I'm off to go take care of my life the way it should be. Leave me all the love you deem necessary."

My entire life is changing (not so much for the worse), so I feel like I'm starting a new one over. I start at FYE on sunday. School starts Tuesday and I can't wait. I will have a new apartment to live, although the distance will suck and gas prices can suck my dick. I'm meeting lots of new people.

Best news ever: I went to a goth club Monday night. So awesome! It was an easy drive to Boston, and apparently I'm a very sexy goth girl dancer. W0rd. Although about 1 in the morning I did get drunk and pass out in the club. Good times.

1. Adam is home, and I actually got to hug him and I almost cried. He walked over to me at the food court and casually tapped me like I wasn't going to freak out in excitement! I have to call him and put him back into a big part of my life. I've missed him more then I've ever missed anyone in my entire life. He was in jail for almost two years. A lot of shit went down in that time.

2. Tax free weekend SUCKED, but now I have 2 days off so that rocks.

3. Pete's party at Friday's pwned.

4. Erik's knee doesn't hurt anymore.

5. apartments on cape are hard to get.

6. I want my kitty, and I want her now. :(

7. School is going to rock, and so will my classes. I can't wait to start.

Now the fun stuff:

I want everyone who reads this to ask me 5 questions, no more no less. Ask me anything you want. Then I want you to go to your journal, copy and paste this allowing your friends(including myself) to ask you anything. (the first part is mandatory, the second is optional.)"

I know updates are few and far between. I work a ton now as the Best Buy customer service senior. And oh, what a pleasure it is...

Things are very off and on. One day is happy, and the others just suck. All my favorite people on LJ are disappearing. I need to get rid of a lot of my belongings so my parents can move. The dog might be gone soon. The cats have nowhere to go. My uncle/godfather is dying of cancer. I am far too stressed out. No one we called to rent from called us back. It's cloudy outside. I'm missing money in my account and I don't know why. Life just seems to spiral up and down to extreme measures for no reason. I hope school starts soon and I can afford it. I need to do theater so I can channel my negative energy into positive. That sounds so unbelievably hippie-ish.

Yesterday, a bunch of friends and I went to Boston. We pissed off T drivers, almost got lost, became dehydrated, visited an uber mall, I held hands with 2 guys (Erik was real fond of Owen, heh heh) and my wife, I ate turkey, Jon threw up, and we got lots of exercise. (Not in that order.)It was a lot of fun.  

Now today, I nap, dress in goth attire, and pick up Erik from work, in that order."

My new job is cool, although I'm worried about how things will work out with school. The classes are all set, but I still want to be involved in plays and I work a tight schedule. I hope I can be in some quick performances with Jim if he does them again. I'll probably tryout for Mike's performance too just for giggles. I couldn't work around his 3:30 to 6:30 rehersal time. Not with classes and working as a senior now. *sigh* It really gets me down. All I want to do is act, but I have to pay the bills. If I could find a decent acting job with the school, I'd be gone in a heartbeat.

On the plus side, Nate contacted me and he's doing a scripted reading in the near future. He specifically called me out to play the girl's role, the waitress. I love the idea that I was in 1 play and my friends see me as a good actor. It's going to be in Middleborough I think, but the drive will be worth it for the recognition I recieved. 

It's 8 now, and I need to work at 9:30, so I better get ready. Seey'all later!"

Erik's feeling much better, and is bending the knee without the brace. Seeing him right after the surgery was still the scariest thing in the world. 

I am a customer service senior now, and Bubba is my new manager. The next few days may be very interesting.

I'm going to Canobie Lake on Saturday and I'm very excited.

I'm saving money to buy furniture and appliances for a new place, which may become Erik;s parents basement. It'll take a while, but it will seriously rock.

Wedding Crashers is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.

Erik's right knee is not as bad as we were worried about, but it still gives him a lot of pain. Hopefully the surgery on Wednesday will lead to some much needed R+R for him. *kisses*

I found out who the other applicant was, and they have a very decent shot. I am worried, but I feel a lot better knowing. Now I just have to wait it out.

Verizon finally figured out that it was the phone model that was defective and since the a650 caused my recent turmoil, they gave me a new upgraded model. The a-670. Very sexy, very beautiful. Has a camera with a special flash. Most importantly, it works with the ringtones!!

Erik is the best and most supportive boyfriend in the world. I couldn't have made it through the last week without you. I love-es you so much!!

Evan- I am sorry for my public anger outburst on you. You made me mad that night, and I did have a good reason. We'll talk about it some other time that isn't a public thing. Have fun at camp.

Nicole- You used the p-bomb when refering to me getting the picture today. That's right, ""I promise"". Then you didn't show. It doesn't matter what happened or who didn't do what. You used the P word, and that word to me is an unwritten, unbreakable agreement that one person makes to another. You said you promised the pic issue would get fixed today, and it didn't, and now it hurts like hell. Why did you add to this pain?

Jayme and Owen- You guys are cool, keep being cool.

whoever was the other applicant- good luck to you. But I know for a fact that you can't want this title as much as I do, and it's definetly not for the same reasons. The secretive nature of it scares me.

Verizon- you suck at helping me. The phone model is defective. By the end of the week, if I don't have a non-retarded phone, I will burn your village to the ground.

Erik- I saved you for last because you are the most important. I'm sorry you have had to put up with my depression for a couple days now. Between work and my phone and the picture screw up and everything else that has sent me on this downward spiral, you've been there to make me laugh. I'm sorry I'm so difficult. I don't know what else to do anymore and it's scary. I'm depressed and I hate it. I don't know what else to do.

One more thing,

God- If you really do exist (because I'm doubting it more and more with each passing day), why do you hate me? What have I done to deserve this pain?"

I try not to get in the middle of their stuff, but that time, I didn't speak up because I would've smacked Owen for being a fucktard.

"event","I haven't had a mocha blast in forever from au bon, so I'm very excited to be drinking one. 

I had my harvest interview yesterday. Even though it was with Ruben and Justin (and I hang with Justin at the hen for apples), it was still intimidating. But all interviews really are! They are a lot harder then auditions. With an audition you read the script and become the character in the span of 10 minutes. Easy enough, but it's the phone call afterwards that kills you. With an interview, you talk about yourself and answer questions with everyone staring at you, and hope not to stutter or screw up. Being someone else is easier then being yourself in these situations, and I can't think of another time where this rule would apply.

Much no good badness happening with my parents involving the house that I don't want to get into, but it makes me cry. It's an odd situation, and I'd bet a million dollars that I don't have yet that this hasn't happened to anyone I know, ever. The drawbacks of being poor and fucked over. At least I don't pay much to go to college. 

Plus side: I'm getting a new phone. I guess my dad was whining about not having one and our contract on the current phones was up, so I'm getting a new phone/new contract thing my mom set up. The whole ""free phone"" idea scares me, but the way I figure, it's a flip phone with a color screen, so it can't be a complete piece. I hope. Besides, the 2 year old phone I have already has a shot out battery, and it screws up from time to time. I am excited about cool ringtones too, and backgrounds with color. 

The hen was a blast last night. I wasn't going to go because I had a monster headache and I had been working most of the day, so I thought ""sleep at 10:30"". But then Nicole came in and told me about a shitty day she was having, and she wanted to play apples so I didn't want to let her down. I'm glad I went because we got Alden (Brian) and Griffin (Chris) to go, and the fucking Jon showed up with Mike, and Ana and Joey were there, and it was so much fun. Joey always gets my God cards, but never knows they are my God cards til he throws them on someone else. Who would've thought I loved creamed corn? And Jon and I have the same brain patterns, he got about 90% of my green cards. It was crazy. Then right before we left, D showed up and was really drunk, telling us how he was in some chicks car and he didn't know who she was or where she was, but he did have her ID. It was comical. We didn't stay too late though cuz Erik was sleepy, and there were a shitload of newly graduated kids crawling all over the hen parking lot. Hopefully Pete kicked everyone out of there and closed down the store. There were about 50 teens just satnding around their cars. It was so annoying. We'll have to take the cool people back there again on a normal night. 

Oh, and I ran into Sebastian yesterday. He was the original Bobby in the play. He told me he was working too much to be doing theater anytime soon, but he wanted to eventually. I told him I was still looking for auditions, and he told me about a website to check out. It was www.newengland_________.com, and that blank is where I can't remember the fucking word, so as of now it's useless. Damn me. 

Oh, and Jayme recently made a post that basically said, ""you're not with me you're against me"" or something to that affect. Basically that because I don't agree with anneka hurting her, I'm making her life harder and I'm not worthy as a friend or whatever. I outright hate the bitch (anneka) and I want nothing to do with her for more reasons then 1. I don't forgive her for what she does, but Jayme does. Jayme's treated me like shit ever since I've known her, whether she knows it or not. The ""I was joking"" excuse doesn't work with me. There hasn't been a day in her life where I wasn't verbally put down by her because she didn't agree with my opinion on stupid shit. She always had what she titled as ""Owen fights"" with me, but I didn't appreciate it at all because 1. I'm not Owen and 2. That's no excuse for a random stupid shit fight. anneka (yes there's a reason I don't capitalize: you only capitalize a person's name) outright played her and greedily took what she wanted, this being Jay, at the expense of others, but is forgiven. Why? 
1. The bond of drunken behavior is stronger then real friendship. 
2. Jayme wants to prevent drama (even though she fed off drama for quite a while, including going out of her way to make Nicole's life harder for no reason just to create more drama for her).
3. Jayme doesn't want to hurt anneka (although creating shit in my life every day).   
4. anneka she feels is trustworthy (I like how she can be forgiven instantly even after making a personal attack on you, but when I confront Jayme about getting along with Nicole, she freaked out because she knew nothing other then hating her, but there was never a solid reason as to why that was, especially after Nicole and Owen were no longer dating).
5. Damn, I can't think of another FUCKING REASON AS TO WHY THIS WAS THE DECEISION!!

All in all, I'm done with this shit. If the road split between anneka and Nicole, I went towards Nicole and anneka has Jayme following her. I got a feeling my path was a little more lighted though, because I didn't make a blinded decision. Now Jayme will probably read this and get pissed at me. Hell, I read the post she made in which she said ""I love you but you don't support my anneka choice so fuck you"", but I know what I'm doing with my life and where I'm going, and seeing the above text maybe my life is better off without her in it. I mean, I really didn't benefit more from the friendship if you compare it to how much I got hurt. Everything happens for a reason right? I tried to be a good friend to her, but I guess I failed. There's not much I can do about that now. She wouldn't listen to me anyway, I'm not anneka. 

I have to go to work now. Looking forward to BBQ and laundry and soul caliber tonight. School's probably gonna be a lot different next semester. Life will be as well. C'est la vie."

Apples to Apples at the Hen officially rocks now. Last night Justin couldn't be there, but me, Erik, Owen, Nicole, Ana, and Elway had a blast. Mike and Jon hung out too and it was about 95% fun. All good times til some random creepy guy I didn't know smacked my ass when Owen gave me a piggyback. Much hatred and anger for a while after that. But all in all the night was good.

I wouldn't freak out or anything, he's fucking human. I just wanna be like, ""Did you ever date a girl named <withheld> in the recent past, and did you ever have the sn <withheld>, because then we already know each other."" How hot would that be if I really knew GC? I'd probably squeak. But, I have a feeling I'll never know the truth, even though Joe is convinced because of the phone call.

Anyways, I think I'm forming a good group that's going to go. I wish Mal could go too. :(  Not fair, with the jail and the sad and the NO GOOD BADNESS! Just a few months...

So my email officially changed too, since AOL is a fuckstick. I need to let everyone at school though. And I can't change my myspace account either. Fucksticks, all of them!!!1!!

Eww, Erik's coffee is fucking bitter. Then again, I do put about 8 teaspoons in cuz I'm fucking tapped. 

Yesterday I took every piece of clothing I wanted from my mom's and brought it to Erik's. A lot of it was ""concert clothing"" as I call it, basically you wouldn't wear it in public. But I still would anyways. It better be warm when May rolls around.

The play opens tomorrow and I'm psyched and stressed out. But it'll be good. I need to go to Wareham today to pick up my camera, cuz Erik wants to tape it. Then I'm called at 4. 

I had game night sunday, and I'm very convinced that a certain person there is only nice to me cuz I'm Erik's gf, otherwise aka when he's not around treats me like shit, and I'm real sick of it. I know he has a lot of shit to deal with, and I always ask him if he's ok when he's upset, but apparently that doesn't matter. I'm not a certain customer service girl, and every girl isn't the same, so don't take it out on me for trying to help.

Owen and I are looking at an aparment, more on that later.

Erik and I haven't had a chance to hang out with his friends lately, mainly cuz the fat one's an asshole, and we haven't had the time. I might stop by roleplaying tonight, but I may be inclined to punch people in the face. Although, I guess people of girth will just absorb the shock.

"event","<lj-cut text= ""Scott's profile"">How to simulate an MRI at home with common household items:
1) Place a few two by fours under the comforter of your bed.
2) Place a fan near the head of your bed and turn it up to the ""high"" setting.
3) Take two glow sticks out of their wrappers.
4) Activate the glow sticks and place them into a large brown paper grocery bag.
5) Shut off the lights in your room.
6) Take the bag (with glow sticks inside) and place it over your head
7) Lie down on your bed.
8) Ever see ""Dumb and Dumber""? Good. While lying down, make ""the most annoying sound in the world"". Occasionally breeak this up with machine gun noises and alarm clock sounds.
9) Congratulations. You have now experienced an MRI!!</lj-cut>

That is fucking beautiful. Guess both Erik and Scott got MRI's this week. 

And I'm feeling a lot better now, but the only thing bugging me is financial stressors, and theater anxiety. My play opens in about 9 days, eep! And I'm still drinking day old milk. I'm not gonna be eating for many days, I can see it now.

More talky later, I need sleep."

"event","I haven't eaten in 24 hours. I'm drinking day old milk. My head is pounding. Just heard Mal's back in jail. I have homework due, but I don't wanna do it. The washer is broken and I can't get out of this chair to fucking go to a laundry store (that's what I call it anyways). I don't feel good at all. I'm going into the corner to cry in a little ball now. Somebody bring a gun.

"event","I accomplished a fun goal tonight. I got my poetry teacher to break a rule: she asked what my poem was about. Honestly, it was a my own personal mind fuck of Evan, Pete, Carlos, and Jameason. The poem is good, but you have to know me or read my leather journal to actually understand it. All my poems are getting angry and darker, and it's getting worse and worse. I know things are fixed, but the ashes remain to write about. 

I took a glimpse at my memories today. All the love ones are from Evan or about him. i could erase them, but I won't. Even though it doesn't exist anymore, the topic is still about love, and it would be a shame to dismiss them.

No costume til Monday. No rehearsal friday. I feel like death right now, but I'm not sick. Stress is building up, and it doesn't sit right with me. 

And tonight I discovered that a friend of mine refers to himself to a squirrel as well. I wondered why he got all excited about the squirrel in my poem tonight. It tweaked me out from past experience, but it's still kinda cool. Something also doesn't sit well with me in this area as well. I can't explain it even if I wanted to. Maybe I should write a poem about it, but I don't have the balls. Literally.

I fail at this. I hate insomnia and late night caffeine."

"event","Ok, so I got to class mad early because of crack boy over here (woke up to ""hey hun how ya doing? wanna wake up now"" *kisskisskisskisskisskiss* all in the span of 10 seconds), then I went to school and caught up on homework. I felt organized and life was good. But I was almost late for work because I was too busy trying to decide how to balance school and work next year for my fall schedule, and I have to decide in 2 days. I don't know which one should be the bigger priority for next term. I know about my car payment, and about how I want my education and responsibilies to go. This is really hard. And there's too many questions unanswered right now. Will a higher position open up at work that I'll want to try for? Is there a chance for me to even move up at Best Buy? Which classes do I want to take in the first place? Will I get a part in next semesters play, so I can work a schedule around that? If Best Buy is just fucking with me, where else could I work for an ok paycheck? I don't have these answers, and I need them in 2 fucking days. So going to work, I was a tad stressed out. 

So I'm angry and pissed and biting everyone's head off, but I was slowly calming down. Then I hear ""ello paupet"" and I think DJ is here to bug me. And I turn around and almost pass out when I see Jeff's face! I got to hug him and tell him how much I missed him, and all kinds of good stuff. I was so happy.

Then that evening, Erik took me out with Griffin, Goof, and the fucking Jon to see The Ring 2, and it wasn't bad. It definetly had the creepy factor. And no scary flying suicide birds. Yay! (teehee)

Hopefully I can figure out this schedule thing, and get on with my fucking life..."

"event","Despite what that stupid little timeclock stamp says, it is 5 in the morning. I've been awake for no reason for the past hour, and I have no idea why. Erik has to be up and at a meeting at 7, and I'm the one that's wide awake. Go figure. I think it has something to do with the large cup of caffeine I had earlier, which I deprived myself of for 2 weeks. It did a number on me at rehersal yesterday, and it wasn't pretty. 

I got a letter from Damien saying he'll be getting out soon. Then I heard from two different sources today that he gets out next week. I need to write him before he gets out. I wonder how he'll fit into my life this time...

I hate being awake when I don't have to be. Or rather, I shouldn't be. This blows.

And you know what happens when I try to fall asleep. I hear lines. All the lines from the play. They don't even have to be my own, but they repeat themselves over and over again. At this point, because of this night, I don't think I have to worry about forgetting lines. They drown out my thoughts, and that creeps me out. 

Which brings me to my next point; the play opens in less then 3 weeks. And we have no set. And the costumes are still being worked on. And we don't have all the props as of yet. The panic will soon begin!

It's really cold when your not under the blankets. Erik looks so sleepy, I hope I don't wake him with my pointless typing. I can't wait until summer when it won't be so cold. I hate being cold.

Alright now i'm rambling. Wheeeeee!"

Oh, by the way, your welcome :)

More updates when I have the time. For now, leave the love."

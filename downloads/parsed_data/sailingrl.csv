"event","so, i just changed the colors and stuff on my journal and marcela told me that i need to update it more often, so i am taking her advice and updating it. this week is going by really slowly, and i feel sick cuz of my allergies. i keep sneezing...its no fun. tomorrow i dont have my second class, but i still have to get up for my 8 o'clock english class where we dont do anything anyway...oh well, no more english for me after this. i have my advisement for the music department next monday, so tonight i was looking in the catalogue to figure out what classes i need to take for next semester...and i took me like forever!! its so confusing to figure which ones i have to take for major classes and which ones are just GE's and which ones are going to suck!! so now i just have to go and get them all approved so that i can register for classes. i was planning on taking winter quarter classes at the community college back home over break, but since all of the budget cuts, they cancelled winter session...thats cool though...no studying on my break then. i guess ill just work and rest and bug all of my friends who dont get like almost 2 months off of school...hehe. my music classes are winding down...i have like 3 more rehearsals and then im done for the semester...since we have our concerts before thanksgiving!!!...my flute teacher yelled at me at my lesson for not having my music as perfected as she would have liked, but i dont think that its totally my fault, cuz she cancelled my lesson last week cuz her mom lived in simi valley and she needed to go help her or something...she is making all of us perform in a noon recital the week before thanksgiving, so that we will be prepared for our juries...i dont really wanna do that so much...i guess i dont really have much of a choice. i should go get some sleep before my early class...good nites"

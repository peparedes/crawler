I have an album in the works. My first album. I am copyrighting and publishing my music so I can the green light to stations that have asked to play my music. I am playing paid gigs and talking to different studios and have a banjo player, guitarist/xylophone player/tambourine man/producer, voice coach, guitar teacher, and manager that I love endlessly. I'm writing my own material and performing it every week. I am taking cake classes at San Antonio College and committed to an internship I love and making plans to go on tour this summer. 

So i'll just come out and say it. I am a musician. I am a singer/songwriter who loves Americana and folk music and as far as i know I could do this for the rest of my life and never grow tired of it. I am finally dedicated and passionate about something again. All the while, living in San Antonio, Texas...cowboy boots and all. 

As fucked in the head as this all makes me sound, I have never been happier."

Someone told me a story the other day about how they used to be uptight, anal, pedantic, totally self-obsessed, and generally just a miserable person. Then they were diagnosed with cancer. It was curable, and she recovered, but she said it completely changed her life. She said:

""At that moment, when the doctor told me I had malignant cancer, it's like my entire life was crystallized, and I realized what mattered and what didn't, and all the mistakes I was making were completely clear to me. After I got over it, I stopped being the person I was, and became the person I wanted to be.""

I have heard this about a million times--how being diagnosed with a serious life-threatening illness or having a near death experience completely changed the way someone thought about their life. I stopped and tried to picture myself being diagnosed with malignant cancer--what would I do differently? How would I change? 

FOCUS: If you are up for it, try this exercise: Close your eyes and picture yourself in a doctors office. Really envision the whole thing; waiting in the outer room, wearing the gown, getting x-rays and MRI's, waiting for the doctor...and then having him tell you that you have been diagnosed with malignant cancer. It has a 75% chance of recovery, but you may very well die. Try to really get into the emotional mindset that comes with being diagnosed with a terminal illness. 

If you do that, there are two questions:

1. How would your life change?

2. Why are waiting for cancer to make those changes?
______________________________________________________

I read this thread yesterday, thought about the focus for a few minutes, got frustrated and just went to sleep. It's been reeling through my mind ever since. It's amazing how many times in the last year I've been forced to sit down and really reexamine different aspects of my life. Most of the time it comes in the form of a cold, hard slap in the face...but God knows I've needed it. 

By the time I graduated highschool I had my entire undergrad planned out. Exchange year in Turkey, study Arabic in Egypt, start Middle Eastern Studies at SLC, then Arabic again in Lebanon, year abroad in Egypt...bla, bla, bla. 

Well, fast forward to the end of last year, all is going as planned and I'm set for Lebanon. A month before I'm to leave I start having second thoughts. Two weeks later, I'm fucking petrified. Before I know it I'm absolutely dreading it. I finally realize that this perfect roadmap I had drawn on was caving in on me. Shit, all I really wanted to do was get a summer job and live on my own for a while. 

There was an obvious pattern in the choices I had been making. Escape, escape, escape. I would do just about anything to get as far away from Laredo as possible (both literally and figuratively speaking). Learning a foreign language was a great reason to run off to the country where it was spoken. My studies were so far removed from my life that I would have to move to the other side of the Atlantic to pursue them. 

So I didn't go to Lebanon. I moved to Austin and got a job canvassing. Then I started cocktailing. Would it look good on a resume? Not unless the job qualifications included ""awesome buttery nipples"". But was I enjoying it? Fuck yeah. It's good to know I can always fall back on 6th street for easy tips and cheap tequila. 

After a semester of rest I started getting ancy again. I don't know what was scarier; taking a risk in Austin or taking a risk in New York. I was terrified I would come back to SLC and hate it, but feared that if I didn't give it another change I would regret it down the line. In the end, I forced myself to come back because I was tired of running from the places that scared me. 

________________________________________________________________
FOCUS: Some good advice from the forum...

""Well, why don't I just go ahead and do what made me happy from the beginning? Why doesn't anyone? Because we're told to be reasonable, more like [insert authority figure name], conservative, etc. Just go back to the beginning and ask yourself, ""Minus my mother/father/teachers' expectations, what did I want to be?"" Figure it out, work your ass off to get it, and make yourself impervious to the, ""you don't have a real job[s],"" the ""you're having an early mid-life crisis[es],"" and the ""it will never work[s].""

But be prepared for the loneliness, as your family and friends disapprove of their formerly unhappy, malleable and dutiful chum stepping the fuck up and making his life his own. You are brave, sir, and I applaud you for having the audacity to think of your own happiness first. Socially, its radical."" 

----------------------------------------------------------

(1) Enough with keeping up appearances. I'd be on the first plane back to Austin. I'd take a light load in school. Maybe ACC at first, or transfer to Southwestern. I'd go back to focusing on theatre. Take voice & guitar lessons. Focus on developing all of the music I've started but never finished. Play tennis regularly again...fuck do I miss my backhand.

(2) Um, I have no idea what I'm doing? I'm scared shitless? I've yet to conquer my need to prove that I'm better than Laredo (whatever the fuck that means). I only do ""safe"" radical? I'm afraid all of this is just another escape? Is it just that I'm not trying hard enough? Seriously ok I have no fucking idea already. My hair hurts. 


....Anyone else want to take a crack at this?"

Left Behind: Eternal Forces 

November 14, 2006 - The video game industry is no stranger to controversy. Whether the waves are being made over sex, drugs or violence, it seems that there's always something on which legislators, lawyers and parent groups can hang their scorn. Games that promote lifestyles and behaviors that would be intolerable in the real world routinely come under attack for the influence they are believed to have on gamers.

Left Behind: Eternal Forces seemed like the perfect antidote to that. Nevertheless, this Christian-themed game, based on the popular book series about mankind's final days against the Antichrist, has inspired its own controversies. Some rejected the seeming intolerance inherent in the game's emphasis on converting non-believers. Some objected to what they perceived to be the game's exploitation of Christian theology. Misinformed or not, the controversy has definitely helped raise the visibility of this game and bring it to audiences it might never have reached otherwise.

In brief, the game follows the basic premise of the book. One day, all the true Christians vanished from the world. Though the authorities left on the Earth tried to explain this away as some freakish magnetic pulse, a small group of people suddenly realized that the Christians had been raptured up to Heaven. These new believers, those left behind, now find themselves fighting against the forces of the Antichrist who is building his world government on the bones on the United Nations.

The game lets players take charge of the new believers in the struggle in a standard real-time strategy format. New York City is your battleground and missionaries are your soldiers. You'll be fighting against the forces of the Antichrist -- secular recruiters, rock stars and cultists. Who comes out on top will depend on how well you use the resources at your disposal.

At the most basic level, the game is about using your disciple units to recruit more believers. These believers can then be sent to a variety of structures for training in other essential roles: they can become disciples themselves and go out to recruit more believers; they can become builders to buy and refit old buildings; they can become musicians to shift the allegiance of evil units to neutral; they can become soldiers or doctors to help on the frontlines when things get bloody. There are various tiers and upgrades to be found among each of the classes but the basic functions are still the same.

Although the buildings you own provide important resources like housing, food and cash, everything in the game revolves around the resource of spirit. Each unit has their own spirit ranking. You can increase it by praying or decrease it by killing other units. Raise the spirit of a neutral and he or she will join the good guys. Lower it and they'll take their part with the forces of evil.

The early missions focus on walking around and recruiting new units. As you gain more experience with the interface, you'll start to build your own infrastructure by taking over buildings in the city. You'll also come into conflict with the bad guys of the game, the Global Community Peacekeepers. Since they don't have to worry about their spirit rating dropping too low, they're not penalized for killing your units.

To keep the balance of power in your favor, you'll have to find non-violent ways to avoid getting killed. Your units will definitely fight back in a life or death situation but, for the most part, you want to either avoid your enemies or have a ready plan to convert to your side using musicians and disciples. This gets much harder as the game progresses.

There are some small problems with the overall interface. For one thing, your disciples seem to have a hard time selecting neutrals to convert. We frequently (and we mean frequently) had to click around and around just to get our disciples on task. Eventually, you'll stumble on the idea of setting your units to automatically use their powers but even this causes problems. The units just aren't smart enough to take any initiative here so you'll spend the majority of your time micromanaging the particulars rather than planning out your overall strategy.

Pathfinding is excellent when you're just moving down the street. Your units will occasionally walk right into a moving car but they always bounce right back and continue on their merry way. The problem arises when you give a unit an order and their path is blocked by something as simple as a lightpost or a mailbox or another unit. They sometimes simply can't find their way around these obstacles so you'll have to waste even more time leading them around by the hand. I've had units literally not be able to find their way across the street.

There are also some faults in the mission scripting. Nearly every mission requires you to build a bank before you do anything else but none of the missions actually tell you this. Instead, you'll be told via in-game dialogue and your objectives screen that you need to build a chapel right away. Once you build it, a window pops up telling you how stupid you were for not building a bank first and then asks you if you want to restart. Uh, excuse me?

Many missions also end if portions of your characters lose their faith and become neutral or evil. Where it might lead to some interesting back and forth action, it instead results in immediate mission failure. It certainly doesn't say much about the persistence of those who are left behind if they're willing to throw in the towel just because the enemy seduced away one of their believers.

Persistence will pay off for you, however, as you make your way through the missions. Succeed and you'll be rewarded not only with forward progress but with some interesting articles about God, the Bible and your place in the universe. The short articles are intended to stimulate thought and discussion about spiritual matters. The ones that place the argument in a historical or scientific framework are remarkably enlightening and compelling. Those that lean a bit more towards matters of opinion aren't quite as interesting or thought provoking.

In any case, the controversy about the game's message has been overinflated somewhat. Given the wide range of games that are inspired by religious, mythical and supernatural beliefs, it's interesting to see a game that presents the concepts of a modern religion like Christianity as core components of gameplay. True, the very idea that converting non-believers is the central activity in the game is likely to alienate some people but it really shouldn't be much of a surprise to people that a game with a picture of an angel and a warning about the antichrist on the box is going to have a Christian slant.

Still, even those gamers who appreciate the game's message will notice some uncomfortable inconsistencies. The game takes a firm stand about the righteous subject matter and gameplay and then lets the player turn around and play as the antichrist in multiplayer. While the variety is nice (or would be if there was anyone actually playing online), it tends to undercut the morality of the game's overall message. You can even add to that the mild traces of sexism arising from the gender qualifications for jobs -- ""Sorry, Sally. We'd love to convert you, but we only have room for one more believer and we all know girls can't build houses.""

The graphics are poor. Buildings are composed of simple polygon boxes with little ornamentation or style. You'll get the odd awning here and there, but for the most part, the buildings are flat and featureless. The textures are equally flat, even on the highest detail settings. The intricate designs on the front of a chapel are rendered with no more depth than you'd see on a cardboard cutout. Frequent repetition and flipping of tiles doesn't give the game much variety.

The only textures that look good are the high number of billboards and advertisements scattered throughout the city. While some gamers might be offended by the presence of these ads, they actually serve to make the game world feel a bit more real. Steam rises from grates in the streets, and adds to the overall realism of the environment. Buildings cast shadows on one another as well, which can reinforce the sense of scale here.

The character and vehicle models are a bit better but only because you don't get as close to them as you do to the buildings. Animations are reasonably convincing for the people, but the cars are laughable. They can only move forward in eight directions, so they're a blast to watch as they turn through intersections. Even more ridiculous, some vehicles will just spin all the way through the intersections.

Special effects on each character when using an ability are bright and effective. It would be nice, of course, if the different character types had a little more unique look. It's not always easy to tell which of the brown-haired guys in white shirts and vests are your believers and which ones are your musicians, for instance.

Left Behind's camera works reasonably well in light of the tremendous height of some of the buildings. The zoom and rotate function of the camera lets you see the action from just about any angle you want, and the buildings (almost always) fade to nothingness as the action moves behind them. We ran into a few instances where the camera just didn't want to cooperate. Backing up against the map edge usually leaves a sizable area beneath you that you can't see.

A wide range of voice actors have lent their talents to Left Behind's story but the quality leaves a bit to be desired. Awkward accents (the spunky New Yorker who wants to spread the ""troot"" is a nice touch) and a handful of unnatural readings definitely distract players from the action on the screen. The musical score is subtle but effective, lending an atmosphere to the game that always sits just outside of your awareness.

There are a lot of Christian rock acts featured in the clue screens between missions. While it's not everyone's cup of tea, the selections here are enjoyable and typical of the genre. The style of music, however, serve as an unintentionally amusing commentary on the game's decision to cast electric guitarists as the minions of evil on the Antichrist's side.

Finally, there are some basic functionality issues that continue to frustrate us. The game has crashed several times during loading screens. Given the interface frustrations that threaten the success of your mission, you're likely to be reloading the game a lot. Which means, at least in our experience, that you'll be doing a complete reboot just to get the game up and running again. We've also experienced a corrupted save file that, when we tried to load it, prompted the game to tell us that had a ""lost connection.""

Closing Comments
Ultimately, our opinion of this game is based less on the message it contains than the way it looks and plays. The basic design of the game is intriguing and worthy of a better treatment than it gets here. Fighting for and keeping recruits requires some thoughtful and persistent strategies and the fact that you have to do it without shooting or stabbing your enemies adds even more depth. Unfortunately, the inconsistent behavior of your recruits means you'll spend more time fighting the interface than the Antichrist"

- I somehow managed to type out about 25 pages worth of notes/quotes/ideas for my paper within those 10 hours, yet failed to produce more than 4 pages of my first draft. Oh well, 9 more pages to go. 

- Had a conference with Kristin. Settled on switching to her as my don. Thankfully she likes what I've done with this paper and appears to be under the impression that I have my shit together (for teaching me how to bullshit like a motherfucker I will always be indebted to Extemporaneous Speaking). Apparently other kids in the class did too. If we have time next week she wants me to present my analysis of the Christian cartoons and early 20th century anti-Semitism.  And how neo-evangelists like Pat Robertson/Jerry Falwell/Billy Graham/Hal Lindsay are plotting to rule the world by way of 700 Club telethons. 

- I just sent in my deposit for the SINARC Intensive Arabic program at the Lebanese American University. I'm still pissed I'm not going to the AUB- mostly because of the private beach. Classes? What?! 

- Uh, I have to catch a train in 13 minutes so I can have the last of my bloodwork done. And call back the hospital to set a time for my surgery. And charge my phone. Oops. 

- Apparently Fawaz isn't going to be around at all next year. Kristin is currently looking for a replacement, which possibly means I may ACTUALLY be able to take a legit Mid. Eastern studies course next year. Please God let this be for real. 

- Ross Wade, where the hell are you? I went down to the PAC basement last night (God that sounds wrong)- the lights were all off and I highly doubt you were doing your conference work in the dark. YOU LIE!!! 

- This time tomorrow my parents will be in the city. I'm supposed to go meet them at the hotel. While I won't be able to transfer my 15 conference books to Manhattan, at least I can use my mom as a case-study. Yeah, she's just going to LOVE me after she hears about this. 

- Housing payments are due May 10. I never went to the lottery and I have no intentions of submitting the payment. Perfect way to back my parents into a corner. I NEED A DECENT SIZED CLOSET THAT DOESNT COLLAPSE ON A BI-WEEKLY BASIS GOD DAMNIT.

You can't walk around without hearing that famous Nextel Cherp! and then "" ey guey! where you at!?""

You know at least 10 people who have taken pictures with a playboy bunny background at ""fantastic Shots"".

If you get stopped by the police, don't worry about it, you probably know him! He's your best friend's mom's tia's nephew's abuela's commadre's cunyado. No sweat!

The best months to go swimming are between February and November.

100 degrees is nothing to you. Hell, 110 degrees is still mild weather. Give me 120 degrees, and we'll talk!

You can't fully comprehend the idea of 4 seasons. There's summer (which lasts 3/4 of the year) and something in between.

You have friends named Juan, Jose, Poncho, Pancho, Ale, Daniela, or Lupita.

You don't know the difference between green, red, or yellow stoplights. You've never heard of a stop sign. Blinkers are only there for decoration. For that matter, staying in the correct lane means nothing to you.

You can't hit the bars without your bullet-proof vest. 

As soon as you move into your own place you realize that you don't know how the fuck to do laundry/dishes/etc. Don't all homes come with housekeepers?!

You wear heels, makeup, and skin-tight jeans to the grocery store. 

Though you won't admit it, you're suspicious of all natural blondes. 

If it doesn't include tortillas, jalepenos, pico de gallo, or frijoles, it's not a real meal.

I'd be more than happy to turn in my incompleted first draft...in all honestly it really shouldn't matter considering our conference papers arent due FOR ANOTHER FUCKING MONTH. Seriously Fawaz, you are NOT going to read my 19 pages of crap. You're not. So stop pretending you care. Because it's annoying as fuck.

I got an e-mail this morning from the Center for Arab and Middle Eastern Studies (CAMES) at the American University of Beirut. I applied to their summer intensive Arabic program last week (yeah, I know, Aly what the fuck were you thinking). I decided to apply on a whim- last minute. I faxed/emailed the entire application to Beirut Friday morning. The deadline was today. It's a rolling application, so I have no idea if there are even any spots left. In any case, the email confirmed that the AUB received my application...which is a relief. Faxing 20 pages to Beirut twice isn't exactly cost efficient. 

Just in case the AUB gig falls through I applied to another Arabic program at the Lebanese American University (also in Beirut). The application comprised of one online form- no essay, no transcripts, just one reference. A day later I received my letter of acceptance. SKEEEEETTTCHYYY. 

I'm going to be straight up pissed if I don't get into the AUB (mostly at myself, I knew about the application deadline months ago). I already have friends in the program, I'm familiar with the campus (and LOVE it. Especially the private beach. Who said anything about class?). The location is prime. GOD DAMNIT IT'S 2 PM IN BEIRUT WHY HAVEN'T I HEARD BACK FROM THEM YET. 

Mmmkkay. I need some sleep. Like, bad."

"event","1. After three lovely years of trecking through deserts far and wide, my computer is on the brink of death. First the memory overload, then the broken screen, the SEVEN keys, and now Livejournal isn't working. I realize the latter is easily fixable, but I've lost patience. I am now looking into  invensting in a MAC. I've been a faithful Windows user for 15 years now, but Windows has done me wrong. It's time I convert.

2. I am sick and tired of having to invent new ways to store my things all over this tiny room. I am planning on finding an apartment somewhere in the Westchester area for the Fall. If I can convince my parents to let me bring up my car, I'll be in heaven. Only problem is the roommate situation. Single or double, single or double, single or double? I think I'm ready for the single life. I'm ready for my own apartment. 

3. I'm meeting with a new therapist on Monday. She's setting me up with a psychiatrist in the area as well. While I did have a full night of rest yesterday, I'm afraid relying on pot to get me to sleepy-land for the rest of my life isn't a wise decision. It's time I go back on meds.

4.  I'm starting private Arabic lessons in Manhattan twice a week. If all works as planned, I'll study MSA in Beirut this summer at the ""Advanced Elementary"" level. Which means I'll have time to stop by Egypt & Turkey. Maybe visit Syria with my sister's (Syrian) fiancee? Maybe Aman? Maybe Dubai? Oh the possibilities! 

5. I have a paper to write for my Islamic Studies class, due Thursday. On what, exactly? I have no idea, I didn't make it to class this week. This should be an interesting weekend.

6. I am going to get on top of my schedule. I am going to get on top of my schedule. I am going to get on top of my schedule.

On that note, I've got some laundry to put in the dryer. More later."

I've traded in my short skirts&nbsp;and sandals for wool sweaters and rain boots. Well, ok, i'm still wearing short skirts. In any case, <lj-cut text=""fall is in full swing here at Sarah Lawrence College. ""> fall is in full swing here at Sarah Lawrence College.</P>
<P>Things have been hard, but pending my upcoming return to Texas, I can't complain. All semester I've teetered between high-highs and very low-lows. Come the weekend, either on campus or in the city, I somehow manage to find my little niche and return to my old optimistic, idealistic self. The weather is beautiful, the city is beautiful, my friends are beautiful. Life is just beautiful. </P>
<P>I was deeply concerned about my choice to come to Sarah Lawrence for a long time, but in all honesty, this place is really starting to grow on me. I can't express how incredible it feels to be truly inspired/motivated by my classes. And though many would argue that this campus is composed of nothing but angsty, bitter teenagers, I always seem to find myself in good company. And hey, for those days that we're feeling like utter shit, there's always a silver lining. Like pot-induced robot porn.</P>
<P>I've realized that it's time to fess up and accept the past for what it is: <EM>the past</EM>. I've wasted too much time sitting alone in my room dwelling on guilt-ridden memories of broken relationships and silly mistakes. I'm ready to finally start feeling comfortable in my own skin instead of constantly comparing myself to&nbsp;others.&nbsp;It's an ongoing process, and though I'm sure there'll be harder days to come, I secretly know that deep down inside myself I'll find solace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>And you know what's great? I feel like a kid again.&nbsp;I dance around my room like an idiot, even when people are watching. I flood my roommate with hugs and kisses for no apparent reason.&nbsp;I look forward my mother's evening phone calls. I can't help but revel in my little adolescent crush. Nothing beats the way the I feel when we lock eyes and exchange smiles. And boy, does she have a beautiful smile. </P>
<P>Exactly one year ago today, I was sitting in a hotel room with my sister, celebrating my 18th birthday. That night, after drinking&nbsp;a&nbsp;bottle of wine,&nbsp;I sat on the balcony and cried for an hour. Happiness seemed to be&nbsp;galaxies away then. So maybe things aren't perfect. But, one year later, I've come to one critical conclusion: maybe the cosmos aren't plotting against me afterall.</P></lj-cut>"

"event","<P>Twenty minutes ago I woke up with a terrible hangover. Still clothed from the night before, I pulled myself out of bed to go to the bathroom&nbsp;and vomit/shower/detox.&nbsp;I tripped over an empty wine bottle and fell face first into a heap of dirty clothing. That's when I saw them. A pair of men's boxers laying on my floor. And that's when I remembered.<EM> Shit,</EM> time to <lj-cut text=""take out the trash""><BR><BR>I met Austin over two years ago. He was a friend of a friend...in his mid-20's, an ex navy seal just about to start his new job with Blackwater USA. Though his career in ""private contracting and security"" posed a serious moral dilemma for me, he was young, attractive, and sweet. A real Southern gentleman. Now, we all know I'm no Southern Bell, but what the hell, he was kind and I was lonely. We exchanged e-mails and decided to work from there.<BR><BR>While I was in Turkey he wrote me constantly. We chatted from time to time, and though none of the things he ever said were terribly profound, I was captivated. He quickly became infatuated, and I went along for the ride. He eventually made plans to visit me in Istanbul, and I promptly stopped answering his e-mails and hoped it would all fade away. Fade away, it did. For the time being.</P>
<P>Austin returned from Iraq in early September. Suddenly the e-mails started up again. I was aching for a love-interest, so I gave him my number. From that point on, we spoke on a daily basis. I had finally found someone who would listen intently to my rantings and ravings. I spoke for hours and hours of how much I missed being away; he was fascinated by it. So when he made serious plans to visit me in New York, I figured it wouldn't be so bad. The vacant spot in my bed would finally be filled. I'd have a hand to hold for a few days. It would be a small glimpse into what it's like to <EM>actually </EM>be in a relationship. Sleep together on a constant basis. Know each other's scent. Have silly nicknames.&nbsp;After he would leave&nbsp;to Iraq, and I would move on.&nbsp;Simple enough, right?<EM> Right??<BR></EM><BR>Wrong, wrong, wrong. Austin arrived Friday afternoon, and by that evening I realized we were completely incompatible. While I found our clash in interests strangely endearing before, it became quite apparent that we were like night and day. He dismissed his silly translators in Iraq as those ""Arabic peoples"".&nbsp;Used words like ""ain't"". Spoke fondly of protecting prominent contractors and Rumsfeild in Baghdad. I strapped on a penis and decided for the next few days I would put on an act. I needed to get laid. Bad.<BR><BR>I did get laid. To be frank, the sex was great. But eventually every other thing that came out of his mouth got on my every last nerve. Suddenly being a good lay wasn't good enough. So when, yesterday, the topic of Guantanamo Bay came into conversation,&nbsp;I let it rip.&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering spending more than two hours with the&nbsp;guy <EM>was </EM> torture, I shouldn't have been surprised. Ugh.<BR><BR>Last night, after having one too many drinks, we started up again. I remember there being a point in the conversation where he described the things he ""wanted to do to me"" when we got home;&nbsp;and the idea of being intimate with him again literally made me nauseous. I knew it was over then.&nbsp;The war debate got heated, personal attacks were made, and by the end of the fight we were both steaming. I threw my keys at him, told him to&nbsp;grab his shit from my room and leave, and he promptly agreed. He mentioned something about me coercing him into sex, I went off on a rant. And told him to fuck off in Arabic.&nbsp;I guess I should&nbsp;give him more credit, because by the time I took the train back to Sarah Lawrence he was somewhere in Connecticut. &nbsp;</P>
<P>And if the phrase ""I told you so"" comes up one more time....<BR><BR>Below: Some of the pictures from Austin's time in Iraq. I really hope I don't end up in Guantanamo for this. God knows I can't take any more psychological torture.</P>

"event","Right, so...since I last left off?  College, summer camp, slacker rehab, whatever. Man, where the fuck <i>have</i> I been?!

Fast forward to this weekend. I recently decided to try and dive back into the dating scene with full force. And, as is always the case with me, hilarity ensues.

We'll start here: Last night I went on two dates, back to back. The first, with Andrew, an Australian-born expat of Egypt and Greece, currently earning his grad degree at Penn State. He just returned from a year of backpacking through sub saharan Africa. Do they really make em' like that anymore?

The second, with Zak, a 29 year old (yeah, I KNOW) Jersey boy who currently earns a 6-figure salary editing & producing news for NBC. Attractive, intelligent, and ambitious. Shows definite signs of OCD and that crises many late-twenty-somethings suffer from (otherwise known as extreme bitterness and spite). He has a fetish for spas and shoes. Potential closeted-freak.

Before the official dates, Zak and I definitely hit it off. Because I expected our night on the town to conclude in a bonanza of fireworks, I cut things short with Andrew. In fact, I was late in returning his calls and tried to cancel. Massive motherfucking mistake on my part. First impressions really are a sack of shit.

Andrew ended up being terribly fascinating, down to earth, and to my surprise, charming. He made it clear that's he's got nothing-and-everything left to lose (which, in my eyes, is awfully endearing). Zak, although charismatic and quite cordual, was difficult to take seriously. Throughout the entire evening it felt as if I were on a date with a media personality. He's far too cheesy, and if my predictions are correct, high maintenance. Halfway through the night I snuck off to the bathroom to call Andrew and tell him that I had a great time and really hoped to see him again. Tragically enough, I'm pretty sure I fucked up my chance with him. Way to use good judgment, Aly. Ugh. 

Either it was the one-too-many frozen margaritas I downed, or total desperation, because Zak and I ended the evening with a stroll through hell's kitchen, hand in hand. There was chit chat of our next meeting, a long embrace, and soft kisses on the cheek. Reason tells me that I shouldn't pursue things any further; as genuine as he may actually be. I'm not sure that I really want to run the risk being some 30 year old's Lolita. Selin, where the hell are you? I NEED SOMEONE TO KEEP ME GROUNDED, DAMNIT. 

BUT, of course, I need to step AWAY and remind myself...stop counting your godforsaken eggs before they hatch and leave an awful mess. It's quite possible that neither Andrew nor Zak will want to pursue things any further. And that, my friends, will put me to serious shame.

"event","Dear Jason,

It is approximately 7:30 AM. At this very moment, I should be on Lufthansa flight #539 (seat 49A), downing free cocktails and dreaming of the fresh Mexican Tacos and brisk Sol Beer that await me at home. Instead, I am writing to you from the AUC Hostel in Cairo, Egypt. Just two hours ago I arrived from the Cairo International Airport, where I learned that not only was my flight reservation never booked, but that the flight never existed in the first place. Nor was my flight from Frankfurt to Houston. This, of course, comes two days after I confirmed both flights with you. 

Best Regards,
Your Worst Nightmare

PS. Fuck you."

"event","<P>""You can't compare Beirut to Cairo."" said the Lebanese Immigration Officer. <BR>""Well, how about Beirut&nbsp;to Istanbul?"" I asked.</P>
<P>""<EM>You can't compare Beirut to Heaven.""</EM>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>I would have saved a lot time and worry if I had known that&nbsp;25 Lira was all&nbsp;it took&nbsp;to get me into The Promise Land. </P>
<P>Beirut fucking&nbsp;&nbsp;<lj-cut text=""rocked""> rocked.<BR><BR>Contrary to popular belief, I made it back to Cairo in one piece. I'm $500 poorer, with weaker lungs and liver, but my vacation in the ""Paris of the Middle East,"" was nothing short of glorious. Fucking debaucherous glory. <BR><BR>For four days Regina, Jen and I did nothing but smoke shisha, drink, and dance. I wore heels, miniskirts, and left the scarves at home. Between maxing out&nbsp;our credit cards and snacking on fresh hummus and feteer, we embraced Beirut's overwhelming sights and sounds to the fullest. The music was great, the people were beautiful, and the club life was the best I've seen in years. Better yet, the best I've seen- period. <BR><BR>Selin, for the sake of juice value, I did get some. Boy, did I ever! And with every situation of this kind, there was a considerable amount of absurtidy. ""Yehiu,"" my Lebanese/Turkish beau (yeah,&nbsp;I know, I bagged the one Turk in the club) joined me for a night of drinking, laughter, and ravagement. Honestly, I'm still not for sure if this guy is for real. An hour after meeting &nbsp;he whispered ""every time I touch you I get HOT"" into my ears, for fuck's sake. But, the deal was sealed- I was going to have my Kunefe, and eat it to.&nbsp;To put it lightly, we basically had sex on the dancefloor.&nbsp;Months of sexual frustration raged out of me, curtousy of tequila shots and a <STRONG>hot </STRONG>man in tight jeans.&nbsp; It was <U>fabulous</U>. </P>
<P>Regina and I stumbled back to our hotel room at around 6 AM. With sore feet, lips, and ankles we&nbsp;layed in bed,&nbsp;playing over our last&nbsp;indulgent night like screenplays. Just before I drifted off to sleep, I distinctly remember telling myself that it was the perfect way to end a perfect vacation. You all know what comes next.</P>
<P>The next morning I was jolted from sleep by&nbsp;incessant telephone calls. Remembering that during my drunken frenzy I had promised Yehiu that we would meet one last time, I yanked the telephone cord from its socket. Goodbye Yehiu, Aly needs her beauty sleep. Two hours later, I woke again to a loud knocking at the door. I hid under the covers, grinded my teeth, and just hoped hoped hoped that at some point during the night I hadn't proclaimed my undying love for the potential stalker who was now standing outside of our hotel room.<BR></P>
<P>To make a long story short, though I&nbsp;never told him my room number or even where I was staying,&nbsp;Yehiu had spent the entire morning waiting for me in the hotel lobby. After telling me he loved me, that we just <EM>had to</EM> spend our last day together, and he couldn't live without me, I shut the door in his face and went back to bed. And <EM>that, </EM>my friends, is the way it's done. <BR></P>
<P>So, I did leave the country with regrets.&nbsp;I really should have bought more shoes. <BR>&nbsp;</P>
<P></lj-cut> </P>"

Today I finally took a break from studying and went horseback riding around the Pyramids with some friends. As a result, my crotch has been completely short-circuited.  I'm currently covered in sand, sweat, and horse residue. Delicious."

"event","I arrived in Cairo last night and moved into my dorm. My roommate is a Jordinian who doesn't drink, smoke, stay up past 11PM, and a total neat freak. I still need to unpack and figure out how to get to the main campus so I can get my class schedule. I want to see my family. At the moment there are five Egyptian maids cleaning the room, and this confuses me. A lot.

<P><STRONG>18 days left, and wow, it fucking <EM>blows.</EM> <BR></STRONG><BR>Right about now I should be venturing off into Istanbul checking off my ""Things I've always wanted to do"" list. Instead, I'm sitting in my room, staring frightfully at the two massive cardboard boxes that will soon (hopefully) contain nearly half of ten months worth of clothing, books, and memories. Overnight, my bedroom has been transformed into a fortress of crap. <BR><BR>In other news, it seems that my mother's incessant procrastination has finally caught up with her. For over a month now I have called her every other day insisting that she schedule my plane tickets. Well, today she finally called the airline to find...<EM>Goodness gracious! All flights are booked! </EM>Not only from Istanbul to Cairo, mind you, but Cairo to Texas. When I'm not on the other line nagging, she's on the phone trying to sort the mess out. It seems that now we'll have to switch airlines altogether, leaving her to pay the hefty transfer bill. Sometimes we're so much alike it scares me.<BR><BR>On the bright side: I got a notification today from Righteous Babe Records. Presale tickets for Ani DiFranco's NYC Concerts are on the market as of 9 AM tommorow. November 19, three days before my birthday, I will be&nbsp;dancing my little heart out in the Roseland Ballroom to the tunes of <STRONG>Ani Di<EM>fucking</EM>Franco</STRONG>&nbsp;Tickets are cheap, but I fear if I get anywhere closer than the 10th row I may climb on stage and rape her.

Friend Count

Best Friends: 1) Is engaged, so I'm no longer first on his list which is understandable.

                     2) Has traded me in for a newer model it feels like I'm not sure where I am with him.

Close Friends: 1) Hazelwood: really good guy he has been a life saver this summer even though he doesn't know it.

                       2) Andy: Lives back in Savannah and has more problems than I do so I don't bother him with these things.

                       3) Cinda:  I love this girl completely.  But she lives in Jackson and I beleive the only reason we're friends is that I want us to be.

                       4) Pratt:  Lives in Milan and shares my love of history.  But he is a work-aholic and I don't see him often.

I have other lower friends but these are the big ones and now I see why feel lonely and hurt when I'm alone."

"event","OK.  The last 4 hours have really sucked.  One of my best friends has done that has made me feel like he has stabbed me in the back.  It feels like he traded in one friend for another.  At first I was angry but then I realized that I was totally crushed.  This has called everyone I trusted into question.  Sure I'm an ass most of the time but I'd like to think the people who called me ""friend""  really liked me.  I don't know how to describe it really it just hurts.  I'm sure it's my fault somewhere along the way but I haven't figured out what I did yet.  So ends another chapter in my pathetic life."

Ridding myself of feelings worked so well till now.  The meditations do not work anymore and so sleep comes at a price.  But there is hope in the world of my dreams.

"event","I feel myself growing older and more mature.  I good friend of mine pointed out that he had finally figured out he was an adult and that his action were his actions.  That got me to thinking.  This weekend I got a couple of hours to ponder several things that has been on my mind.  Not that these questions have been answered but I now feel I'm on a closer path after 2 hours of reflection and meditation in the woods.

You see in my younger days I had a spot, my spot where I went to vent anger, frustation, sadness, and struggle through depression.  I went back there this weekend and it was like reliving my adolesence.  I remebered every scar on my body and every scar on my whomping tree.  My womping tree is a tree that has taken the brunt of my anger from early adolesense straight through till I began college.  I chose an old yet strong oak tree standing above the surounding forest.  This tree symbolized everything I wanted to be as a person.  Seeing it this weekend nearly brought tears as I realized just how far I've swayed from what I thought I would be.  I went to punching it to let out my pain, sorrow, and all of my saddness.  Once again painting its strong bark with the blood from my nuckles.  

The best thing I've seen in a long time was coming back up the road from my spot my nuckles red, and my parents smiling telling me that I was going to be fine without having to ask what was wrong.  It was then walking up the driveway that I knew my problems were my own and that my parents respected the fact that I am an adult."

We are also going to start up Geology Happy Hour for Martin.  Katayln is making our website, Biscut is checking around to see if there is somewhere that can give us a discount for happy hour, and Matt Hubert is checking into the organization fair to get us a booth to be noticed.  We have three Matts this year (Matt Hubert, Matt Lee, and Matt Elsroad).  There are even more ppl who want to come now that they know when our set meeting time is.  If this keeps up its goin to be great.  On top of that we have 600$ in the bank.

Bad news is that I've worked by myself until today to clean the study room.  Today some other geoclub ppl showed up. (Sigh of Releif)  And I have my doubt about the operations of certain ppl in geoclub.  Black Op. Division has grown by 2.  And we are eyeing one other that will hopefully be able to keep BLack Ops going.

Other than that, Clement we couldn't get the Gamecube or the Xbox to work on the housing P.O.S. TV.  So me and Matt found open doors that got us down to the patio in the middle we sat out there cracking up for about 2 hours.  The fun ended when some creapy guy told us he was locking the building up.  So I went back to the RA room and watched TV.  Oh did get whistled at by some weird night deskworker type person.  BBBBUUUUUUHHHHHH!!  

Saturday started with me leaving Clement throwing the keys to Sabrina and saying hollar.  Get back to Browning watch some toons cause being a 12 yr old at heart as awesome 75% of the time.  Went and hung out with Travis and ending up going to get me, him, and Bina some breakfast.  Watched the Tennessee game and then Matt and Steph showed up with XXX2.  OMG that movie so freakin sucked.  Saturday night just watched TV till back 9.  Then went and played yugioh.  Went to bed quite early which was great.  

Sunday Travis woke me up at 1pm to go eat lunch.  That afternoon beat Red Dead Revolver and got farther into Pokemon on the Cube.  Matt went and to get food since I was on duty.  Got to hang out with Bam.  More video games, and me, matt, travis, sabrina, and jimmy sat out in front of Browning till 3am.

Monday turned in keys at 8am then went back to bed.  Zhenya called at 9 to go with him to turn off alarm clocks.  Was I a little ticked oh yes just a tad.  Went to Ellington bout 12 to hang out with Matt at the desk.  So weird dude was hanging around and Terry Duncan really told him to shut up and go to his room.  While there Loren stopped by, Terry was of course there, and Bam hung around like the cool chicka she is.  Once Matt got off the desk went for food.  Went by and chatted it up with Josh and Wilson.  Monday night had staff meeting.  Hung out in front of Ellington with Matt and Kenzie and now I'm writing this.

So thats the holiday weekend in a nutshell."

Some examples of how bad I've been:
1) Earl Wright: Hows everybody in Browning today.
   Me: Great, as long as you stop giving people the thumbs up all the time.

2) Had to take a black dude up the elevator cause he had the elevator key from McCord and we weren't going to give hime another.  So that had me ticked off.
  
   Black Dude: Why is this f**king elevator so f**king slow? (obviously a limited vocabuary)
   Me: Cause you touch yourself at night.

Those are the only 2 I feel like typing but there were many more.

Except for Josh and Wilson the old freshman and sophmore click is gone.  That is really sad considering how close we were.  Josh Todd is doing well more in love with courtney than ever (there are a couple on my friends list that know josh if you dont know him than buggar off).  Matthew is still Matthew and is in charge of keeping me sane.  Elrod is still around he works at Rural King now.

I am officially a senior.  *Doing a Dance*  I'm so ready to move on in my life to find new challenges and set new goals and meet new people.  At the same time I'm goin to miss my UTM group.  There are some of you I will see the rest of my life some of you after this year I'll never see you again.

"event","I am currently at my grandparents house with 14 other members of my family.  I don't do family so well.  But lastnight we went to eat at Golden Corral (east TN's Ryans).  We got back and played badmitten (sp?) which I've never played.  Ended up sliding in the wet grass and jamming my shoulder really good.  We ended up bedding down at my Aunt's house across the road.  She is the old cat lady.  She has 6 cats 2 inside 4 outside and so many kittens.  So I woke up without the ability to breathe, smell, or taste.  Got woke up at 9 to eat breakfast and didn't get time to do anything not even brush my hair.  So finally got a shower at noon just in time to be rushed back over to eat lunch/dinner, we only do 2 meals a day here.  so me and dad will make a food run later.  But for now im wasting time on the internet."

1.  For all of you that know me reasonablly well know that I hate Uber-Christains.  This woman was obviously Holier than thou.  I mean she beleived that God wouldn't let her shit stink.  She told me I was the kind of punk that would be smote by God at judgement.  My reply: What happens to the hippocrits?  Her Answer: They go to hell.  My next reply:  Well then isn't a Christain that judges someone before they know them a hippocrit.  Her Response: Yes.  My response: See you in hell hippocrit.

2.  This old lady closes our counter through the week.  And I would try talking to her and she would ignore me and shoot a smart ass comment.  So later I treated her the same way.  she went and told the manager!!!  I got yelled at for following the golden rule!!  Bullshit

There were more but thoughs are the big 2.  Plus I'm tired of typing."

They started me off at DTOT (Drive Through Order Taker).  I HATE DTOT!!!!  So quite an asshole I was.  This one guy wanted 8 cheeseburgers but wanted them all dressed differant my response ""This Ain't Burger King you don't get it your way"".  Oh yeah I got wrote up.  Then they put me on counter...more dealing with customers I thought they would've learned.  So when I told a lady her kid was butt ugly.  So yeah I got sent home.

Well its been quite a while much happenings and goings ons.  But to sum it been to a rodeo, watched War of the Worlds (good movie even with Tom Cruise in it), watched Fantatic 4 (no actor could help that movie), the high school croud has officially been disbanded, the new college at home croud makes me feel old except Josh and Andy's GF, Grandparents house still boring, watching your sister have a bigger social life than you sucks, sneaking out to go get a beer with the guys is fun, made fun of Josh's lack of a dating age bracket, and work still sucks.

Now current events: me and Josh are going to Martin Fri-Sun
                    Reasons: for Josh gets to see his new woman and a 
                             weekend away from home
                           : GET THE HELL OUTA THIS TOWN, see Elsroad,
                             see Gibson and do what he tells me,

It was Andy (okay now there are 3 ppl to call that early) he wanted to know if I wanted to help him roll our bosses yard and her son in law's yard.  What a person like me to say other than HECK YEAH!!!!

So i get dressed put my truck in neutral and coast down the road, nah I've never done this before, hech.

We put 65$ worth of toliet paper on there yards and thats a lot of teepee.  Oh and they only had 3 trees.

I roll in about 6:15 sneak into the house get ack in bed and go back to sleep only to be waken up by matthew at 8:30 curses!!!!

Why I feel like a jerk is that I drove by about 11 only to see them picking it up.  I felt bad for them.  And the Equake wasn't much down here."

Some didn't remember who I was!!  I hope I make a bigger impression than that.  And then there are those that I truely pitty.  Now I have come to the conclusion that with the exception of Andy while I am in Hardin County I am totaly alone.

Yesterday I went to the tournement of champions in florence Alabama.  And after such a trip I have one phrase to say DAMN YOU BLACK LUSTER SOILDER ENVOY OF THE BEGINNING!!  Now that that is done I finished 8th out of 20 and Andy finished 7th.

Work goes on as I have become aware of the injustices that truely go on at McDonald's since my younger mind was obviously unable to comprehend what was going on there.  I am now with the exception of last thursday I have gone 9 days without a day off.

In all of my free time I do what every other college gamer does during the summer.  I play video games.  And bless its heart I don't know if my Xbox will make it through the summer as I top off 20hrs on KOTOR2

I had my first serious girlfriend since my freshman year at martin.  Any questions about it ask travis or matthew they know the whole story.  Enough said.

My first year as an RA got mixed success.  For the love of god give me a floor partner I can work with!!  

Geology is still my major to the regret of some people but hey as long as I love it then leave me the ""f"" alone.

On a sadder note this is the first time a considerable amount of my friends are going to be gone which really sucks, for two reasons.  1 I won't get to see them as much and 2 I hope my gas bill won't kill me trying to get to them all.  But, I made several new friends not to replace the old ones but to help fill the void.

Last thing, my home computer is acting crazy so online time and updates are going to be sketchy."

Nic was done in by 9 since her and Mitzi did in a bottle of Jose with in an hour.  We attempted to play KR and with me and Bunn being the only sober ppl playing we thought we would win but Nic was still better.

At about 10:30 or 11 I went downstais to Taite's Keg party where me and Josh got free beer.  Or should I say free foam with complimentary beer added.  So for the rest of the night till about 1ish I moved between the two parties.  Got to hang with Cristy for a while.  Sean and Jeff was there and oddly enough there was no bloodshed.

Unluckily you have underestimated the darkness and your friends give in a abandon you in your greatest momment of need.  With nothing left to do but face the darkness alone you turn and draw your weapon, fighting is better than giving up isn't it.
     You are engulfed by the darkness your soul begins to twist and turn as you shake off the pain and keep fighting.  Right as you were about to give up a beacon of light blasts through the darkness saving you.  Your sword glows with a different light reacting to the light shining through the darkness.  
     You move through the hole made from the blast of light your sword shines lighting the way for your escape.  You find the source of the light a gap in the darkness.  You move through as you fall you here a voice, ""You have the power the world is in your hands, but you will not fight alone.""  
     You awake in your bed.  Whooo, it was just a dream.  A odd light shines from the other end of the room.  Laying in the cornor is a sword.  The same sword from your dream!!  What does this mean?!

"event","Okay last weekend me and matthew went to Coon Creek.  Total count of people was: from UTM: Me, Matt, Gibson, and Crews, From University of Alabama Some old Paleo guy who was too into Brachs, and 2 female master students you didn't talk very much (one of them Gibson thought was the greatest thing on God's green earth), from University of Georgia was Molly (the prof) I met her at GSA and she remebered me I was shocked, Ryan a undergrad that stayed up till 3am playing Texas Hold Em' with us, a dude that didn't talk much, and some old guy who was quite a bastard.

Friday night me and matt went to Savannah to meet my fam for dinner and then went to pick up groceries fro the four of us through the weekend.  We went back to Coon Creek just in time for Crews to be setting up the telescope.  I've looked through it enough that it isn't any great shakes to me so after Matthew had his fill we went to the research cabin and played yu-gi-oh.  Crews came in after about 30 mins and watched us not much later Gibson came in.  We decided to go to the main building and play hold em.  Ryan joined in and we played hold em till 2am.  Gibson kept wanting to loose so he could take off his cloths so we let him start winning when his pot got small.  After hold em Crews wanted to learn yugioh so me and matthew taught him.  We finally sacked out at 3:30am

Saturday morning I got up at 5:45 to help Gibson with breakfast.  That sucked since I didn't sleep at all!!  And me helping with breakfast turned into me cooking all of it with Crews breezing by and making wise cracks.  Saturday morning was spent at the Parson's Quarry and I got to hear the history of the Devonian again.  At the quarry we ran into the intro paleo class from MTSU.

After the quarry we went to see the Brownsport Fm behind that new high school.  After that we moved toward Clifton to the outcrop Latham is always talking about it started raining so we left there quickly.

We then went to CCSC the other 2 schools hit the creek for collecting, I went to bed.  I got up at 7 just in time for Crews to be dying of hunger.  gibson had left for his daughter's band banquet.  So me, matt, and crews went to Pusser's for food.  We played some new risk game before sacking out at 1am when Gibson got back.  We slept in the research cabin this time.

Sunday we hit some of the outcrops around Selmer.  I was there just to sample on the tree.

The trip was really fun but matthew kept trying to strike out with Gibson though he could only get to strike 1 where as I was sitting on strike 2.8"

"event","Since none of you know me well enough to know this about me... I get depressed as school ends.  This year is no exception.

This started in high school knowing i wouldn't see my friends as much.  But now in college it is worse because now i don't see most of my friends for 3 months.

This will also be the first time when some of my better friends will be gone for good and prolly won't see them for years if ever at all.

And it is time that I find this untapped potential everyone tells me I have.  If I truely have it now is the time to find out, will I shine as the star I'm told I will be or will I crash and burn like the person I am now.

But hey I can't be a kid forever as much as I would like it to be so, and who knows I might find someone to share this with but I doubt that will happen anytime soon.

Ahh well life sucks, get over it."

"event","Weds at about 12:30 Josh decides to go to MTSU's happy hour (Yes all the way in Murfresboro (sp?)).  And of course it was all for a girl (Jennifer).  We leave about 3pm and head down to Parker's Crossroads and catch I-40.  From 40 we travel up till we reached HW-840, which lasted about 10 miles and ended even though we could see the road rolling over hills.  We ended up on HW-100 and jumped onto HW-96 which lead straight to MTSU.  May I add that I the navigator suggested 96 the whole time but the driver vetoed me in favor of 849.  We got to Sante Fe about 6:30 we went in and MTSU jumped up screaming at us coming in.  After the initial shock they ordered us a shot.  There shots were in scotch glasses.

This continues for a while, The other MTSU chick (Catherine I think) kept freakin' staring at me.  At first I thought it was my black eye until i realized she was looking me over not just looking at any one place.  Josh kept telling me she wanted me.  Speaking of that Josh was doing quite well with Jenn at this point.  He had felt up and I must say was playing his cards just right.

Well as Josh was pimping I was stuck between Logan and Bone.  Logan is the MTSU version of Yuko.  Bone is an alcoholic.  So it was either get drunk and ignore the smart boy or talk to the smart boy and not get drunk.  I settled for the later one.  We ended up with 3 shots each and six pictures of beer.  The place closed at 10 and I actually got to hear a last call.

Jenn offered us her apartment for the night ( at that point I knew we werent coming home that night).  Josh continued playing his cards right and seemed to be doing good with jenn.  We were all going to go to Bone's and keep drinking.  We left Josh's truck at Jenn's using his great idea of she had to give us a ride.  

We got to bone's and he showed us his 2000 dollar bed and at this point Josh's night died.  Jenn was laying in the floor with Jonathan and we went in the living room to play video games.  Next thing we knew Jon and Jenn were making out hot and heavy.  Josh was pissed, Me and Greg thought it was hilarious, and Bone was ticked cause they were in his bedroom.  We left with Greg to go get Josh's truck and to go sleep at Greg and Jon's apartment. The whole way Josh couldn't figure out what he did wrong.  

We went to sleep about 3am and got up at 6:45am to come back here.  Poor Josh still couldn't figure it out.  We got back about 10:30 am.  Which gave me just enough time to change shirts and grab my stuff before I headed to class.

It was quite fun and a great road trip even if he didn't get the girl."

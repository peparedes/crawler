i throughly enjoy my own company, but god,  conversations with yourself can only last so long before you start to think you're nuts.  i refuse to change, i just want the opportunity to meet the people who are accepting and that i can accept.  sexiness is a plus.

anyway, if anybody cares, my mom is going on disability.  her income is going to be about 25% of what it is now, and were going to be living in the projects basically.  so, im going to try to transfer to albany and possibly live with tyler.  i know that it sounds like a quick way to ruin a relationship.  however, i am not into the idea of food stamps and poor people.  plus, he wants me to and hes a sweetie.  he will also have a freakin sweet '08 honda civic by that point.  so im totally game.

p.s. the above mentioned sweet car will be taking me to florida around the end of july/ beginning of august.  so ill see you kids then."

"event","So about a month ago, it snowed for about a day and a half.  It took me 35 minutes to make a 12 minute drive, and all of the classes at Dutchess were excused around 4:00 due to the weather.  I walked down to the parking lot, which was empty except for about 8 cars.  I got in my car and proceeded to make my journey home through the darkness and sheets of snow.  The inability to safely drive over 25-30 mph (15 mph most of the way, and this is on a road with a 45 mph speed limit) along with the extra 22 minutes added to my drive gave me time to think.  

   I thought abut why the plows had only cleared the opposite side of the road, and not the one leading me home.    I thought about whether or not I could have made it home 4 hours later, and 13 inches of snow deeper.  Mostly, I thought about the only class that probably didn't get canceled.  My 5:00 English 101 class.  The one that's 3 hours long.  The one that I would have had to wait an hour to go to while I watched my car slowly disappear into the snow, and the one that would have forced me to dig through the snow at 8pm for any hopes of finding my car.  

   Yes, it's true, my instructor knew the weather was too dangerous for driving.  That's why she stayed home.  I should have been there though.  At least that's what she said to me.  I should have been in the library, signing attendance sheets, researching for my paper, collecting graded assignments, and being carefully monitored by the librarian (who she had payed) in an empty library.  That would have been the correct thing to do if I didn't want to lose 10% from my final grade.  

   So, out of the 5 people, with fancy 4-wheel drive SUVs that they got from their daddys, who did stay, the rest of the class is also in my situation.  Those who are left.  Those who didn't drop the course when the realized that this woman is a VICIOUS BITCH WHO NEEDS SOME DICK.

My point in writing this is that: I PAID FUCKING TUITION TO SIT IN A CLASS WITH YOUR FRIGID ASS.  GIVE ME SOME FUCKING RESPECT.  I AM JUST AS ENTITLED TO SAFETY AS YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE.  STOP BEING A BITCH AND MAYBE YOUR HUSBAND WILL FUCK YOU.

   Seriously. School policy states that ""On days when the College remains open during inclement weather, students should make their own determination whether to attempt to travel to class based on the safety of road conditions in their own locale. Students will not be penalized for missing class under this circumstance"".  FUCK YOU."

"event","Currently, my life is at a standstill.  I have no expectations, no desires, no goals.  Things happen, I am unaffected.  My surroundings differ from day to day.  Still, nothing changes.  I always find myself here.  It sounds boring, and almost even sad.  It isn't.  To me, it is freedom to know that the choices I make(for however long this may last) will in no way have any effect on anything.  Anything.

Maybe this is just my irrational, illogical, youth speaking.  Or maybe I'm trying to make the best out of something I hate.

However, isn't complete and utter freedom just a beautiful thought?"

"event","Dear 2006,

So, I guess this is goodbye.  I miss you already, aside from the relief of leaving you behind me.  I remember you like it was yesterday, maybe because it was.  You started off with a bang, baby, didn't you?  Yet another fight with my boyfriend, as you came into my life.  All the fights that followed, and the pain, what a memory.  The kind of memory for which you are extremely grateful.  I thought I hated you, 2006, but I guess you don't know what you have until it's gone.  If I could even count the number of times I heard that, who knew it would be the phrase which I relate to you.  You were the end to my Florida High School carreer, and the beginning to what would not be as tough a journey as I had thought.  I found myself in a new state, a whole different place.  I left my family behind, and that comfortable familiarity.  Through that, 2006, you taught me who I could count on to be there, even when I'm gone.  You taught me that love doesn't mean instant gratification, and how healthy pain can really be, how it can lead one to improvement.  I found out how strong my mother and I really were, and how close we could really become.  You showed me new people, some of which are growing close to me.  You had a few adventures in store for me, I thank you for those.  You got me back on track and then your work was done.  So, I guess after all you've done, it's ok to say goodbye now.  These are the memories that will be with me in this year to come.  Boy, 2006, have I learned from you.

So far, 2007 has started with a kiss and a glass of pink champagne, and left me with a mess.  It has brought to me a boy who likes to play hockey, and call me hun.  It has even introduced me to some friends that I didn't know I had.  As we all counted down, with drinks in hand, I didn't really look back, but I didn't look forward either.  I lived in that moment, one of the greatest lessons that you, 2006, have taught me.  

Heres to another one.

with love and gratitude,
Paula"

"event","So I haven't been talking to any of my girlies in Florida nearly enough.  Katie, and Carrie gosh I miss you.  I miss all my other girls too, you know who you are.

So, it's been a while since I have spoken to Patrick for a decent amount of time.  I guess it is pretty fucked up of me.  I just hope hes like met another girl or something, or has some sort of something in his like to make him not care when what is happening happens.  Let me elaborate:  I must break up with him, or at least tell him that we need to discontinue this commitment until further notice.

I met myself a really decent guy.  More decent than Patrick at least.  He may be a smelly, highschool dropout, but at least you can hold a damn conversation with him, but can also be perfectly content in complete silence, and he has an amazing sense of humor.  He holds doors open for me and, even though I can't really get used to that, it nice because it shows that he actually has respect for me.  The sweet thing about it is that, he actually loves the fact that I don't shave, and I don't feel the least bit bad about not showering before I see him.  He plays the drums, which is sweet cause I'm gonna make him teach me.  He's fucking beautiful with his little green mohawk, and the way he walks is just fucking, ohhh.  Yeah, lol at me and punk, who the hell woulda thunk?  Oh I'm a badass rhymer.

I don't know, Monday night I brought vodka over to Mike's and then treated everyone to 40's, so we we're basicly drunk as fuck.  We all danced to Reel Big Fish, or Voo Doo Glow Skulls, or something, keep in mind that I was wasted and really don't remember, I just remember us dancing our asses off.  So, yes Carl totally was coming on to me, and well after that I don't remember, I just remember someone saying ""Paula, you just made out with Carl."", and I didn't believe them for a minute because I didn't remember.  Well, we hung out like every day after that and he was all afraid to do anything, so I finally talked to him about it.  Friday, he bought 40's for the both of us, and then came to Mike's to hang out with us.  After that it was like, yeah, that was it.  We have hung out every day since Monday, and all of his friends keep talking about him asking me out, so I assume he's been talking to them about it.  Carolyn asked me if that was what I wanted, and I was like, ""I don't know, I want to take it slow."".

Apparently that didn't happen.  Needless to say, he picked me up in Shana's car last night and we went back to his house.  I spent the night there, and damn, I'm like a man when it comes to sex.  If he touches my elbow I like pop a boner and I have to stick it somewhere.  Whatever, whatever.  He's good, he's a sweetheart.  It's just really fun to not give a fuck, and do what you please.  I can totally do that with him, and all of our friends are rule.  He doesnt do drugs and his friends wont be a problem and ugh, fucking amazing.  He just asked me out, 10:06pm.  gosh.  Yep, yep yep, there you go."

It's quite pretty. I've just been smoking purple haze out of it since I got it and thats probably why I'm lazy.  A friend of mine bought the bowl for me so it was freeeee.  48$ yo.

Patrick will be here on Monday.  Wow.  I'm happy really, excited, yes.  It's just that he pissed me off last night.  He woke me up to tell me that he did coke tonight and that he was really fucked up.  Fuckin idiot.  Hopefully he will not be such a stupid idiot once he's here.  I really do miss him.

As soon as his mother finds out that he's coming, she starts calling me, though.  That bitch will call the entire time he's here if I know her well enough.  I'm not gonna fuckin answer either.  I mean honestly, this is my time with him, she needs to not pull this shit like she always used to.  It was ok before, but I haven't seen him in months.

Some of the people I meet here are ok.  I'm finding spending time alone alot more enjoyable though.  As long as I have pot, at least.  I miss my best friends, everyone else, not so much.  I miss the beach.  We took an adventure to Jones Beach after Warped tour, where I missed the Bounching Souls AND Against Me!!  Naked old men much?  Where are the women?  They don't need any, they're gay.  Yeah for real yo.  Naked mom, uhhhmmm?!o.O"

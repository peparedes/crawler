Soccer is going well.  I practice with the boys which is aweosme, and I play with the U14 which is the best!!!  Those kids worship me!  Plus I have my Purple Gurples who are all the BEST!!!!!!!  My goal is to A.  Get into shape and lose my summer poundage.  B.  Get good so i can play in college  C. be a positive role model for some kiddies.  D.  Have fun cus I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE soccer.

Man o man.  i've been hangin with my boy ross a ton.  Its been so great.  I think i am the new ryan.  On saterday we sat by the chiminea and then watched the northern lights at the soccer field.  Its just great to hang with a really good friend, especially if you don't have anyone eles to hang with.  I miss kinda the one on one friendship tiems that a best friends entitles you to.  Plus I really want to help him out of his lil hard times.  I know that I really can't make him feel totally better, and take his problems away from him but I really hope I am helping.  I just hate to see him like this.  

 Note to self:  College shit.  Get it done!"

Yes.  Saterday night.  Best time of my life senior year.  PSHHHH. My night consisted of eating hamburgers with my mom and watching forest gump.  Very exciting.  And I wonder why I have the urge to go out and get trashed and make out with some random person.  NAH im exaggerating.  I guess I just wish there was something to do. 

My visit out west really got me excited.  Being on my own.  Meeting new people.  Making my own decisions.  I really want to go out there.  Although it definetely gave me a better appereciation for here. I feel so content and motivated and refreshed right now.

I am really concerned about my friend.  He just got over a bad breakup, and he is distraught.  It seemed like the only thing that kept him going and now he feels like he has nothing.  I really wish I could do something for him, and I am trying my hardest to help him out. i hope he will be alright.


i guess that is all 4 now.

Today was my day off so I just pretty much bummed around downtown for a while and then slept.  That conviently leaves me up at 1am not tierd... hmm 
OH well Im just chillin to Green Day and looking for shoes on the net.  I've decuded I need new shoes.  I'm looking at an attractive pair of vans.  they are a lil different, not the typical skate shoe.

I met some guys yesterday from the cities that are going to hang out up here this summer.  I have decided to hang out with them if I ever see them again.  Nick.  He works at Grunkees.  I was gonna go talk to him down there this morning but I slept in too late.  Whoops.  Oh well I don't want to force anything.  I'm sure I'll see him agian.

Work is crazy.  I work tomorrow night and then do a double on Sunday.  i have mixed feelings about it.  It is so hard for me, although it seems fairly easy.  I don't know whether I do well at it or not.  I kinda want to quit next year, but on the other hand it is a really good job and it pays well and you get to eat for free.

Just watched Ms. Congeniality with led.  It was faintly amusing.  I was glad to hang out with her cus I haven't seen her in a long time.  I guess I do miss all of those gals.  I haven't seen them all in a million years."

"event","Well.  WE are now counting down the days until school is out.  My life is getting more complicated by the minute and there are a BIZILLION things I need to do b4 summer comes.  Talk to my boss.  Fill out applications for the Aquaculture center.  take the ACT. Babysit this weekend.  See star wars at least 3 more times.  Start studying for finals. English.  Soccer.  The list goes on and on.  Im feeling stress creeping up into my brain.  I've done well so far so I'm not too worried but it still isn't too fun to be kinda frantic about things. I've been also thinking about a new prospect on my radar, but what eles is new.  It seems like im always THINKING about someone all the time but nothing really happens.  And its not like I LIKE billions of people either.  I think its just me labeling people ""possiblities""  that I get too wrapped up in.  I mean ok, even though prom was the most perfect ever, I can't get all jumpy just because he danced with me once.  On the other hand he doesn't often do something that he doesn't want to do, or rather he doesn't do things that arn't for his benifit. Here I go again in circles. 

It is my dad's birthday in a few days I should get him a present.

My mom went to the store and got me a JACKPOT of desserts.  I have not had a suger high in seriuosly MONTHS! So I ate some pudding and some ice cream and am still coming off the unmatchable buzz from suger.

JR/SR banquet was wierd. It has evolved from something wholesome and fun to the oppression of Juniors by seniors.  I think it was suppose to be like a bonding thing for the jrs and seniors.  A sort of pass on the torch thing.  An event where we could all share memories and honor the Seniors.  I think it has become a warped and mutilated event.  Next year we are going to have a cook out in the coast gaurd park.  Hotdogs, Brats, potato salad, FUN!  We will acutally associate and talk to the juniors.  We will be all around more celebratory and laid back than Britt and his class.  He hated the dinner.  I feel so rejected just cus he has to have everything perfect.  And seriously when he is off in College next year he isn't even going to remember the Jr/sr banquet and how they had to eat on paper plates.  I think he was just sara lacy-ied to death last year and he figures he deserves the same thing she got from him.  oh well it will all change next year.'

On Friday we beat Washburn.  For the first time in Girl's soccer history WE BEAT WASHBURN.  I had the picture perfect FIFA World cup Goal!  Carina crossed a corner kick and then I headed it in.   It was so sweet!
It felt SOO SOO SOO good to beat them.

Saterday.  Felt kinda sick in the morning and wasn't able to do the Apple Blossom. I guess you cant do everythng.  I went to ashland to get my hair done,  got ready etc, ect.
We went to Wild Rice for dinner and I ate DUCK LIVER!! whoa
Prom was so fun.  My dress was SOO awesome.  It was incredible and I looked SO good in it. Everything about me was just magical.  And to top it all off  Someone acutally asked me to slow dance.  FOR ONCE IN MY INTIRE LIFE! AND it wasn't just anyone, it was who I absolutely wanted to dance with.  That seriously was prolly the best part of the whole weekend right there.  I still am just in awe of it.  PERFECTION.  Then I went to Kate's and we drank a bottle of fake ""Champagne""  and toasted to the wonderful events surrounding the evening.  We talked and then feel asleep.  

Today I went to STAR WARS!  Besides an icky run in with Eggers it was So great.  I can't even believe the movie.  It is the best movie ever.  I need to see it at least 3 more times.  I seriuosly cried and I probably will again.  Ross and I have a date to see it again together.  Maybe I can get eli in on it too.  OMG!  I just am sooooo crazy happy.

Alas, we have to go back to reality tomorrow.  AH well school is almost over.  but for tonight i will just bask in the perfectness of this weekend"

That is, if there arn't a lot of girls signed up already, and if I get to practise on the course ahead of time.  Who knows.  But I think it is a cool thing to try.

 Saw Adam at the hill today.  Did not say one word. Crap. Im back to square one, kinda trying to forget him/ wonder if i should just go all the way and get it over with.  I really don't think I should be liking him.  He is a waste of time cus he prolly would never like me. I guess because there are no other options I just still like him.  Who knows. It just makes me mad and confusedand wierded out.

"event","Well I did it. I called him up.  It wasn't like anything romantic or surprising or exhilarating......
well maybe it was a small adrenaline rush..
I kind of feel like I made a fool of myself on the phone and wasn't direct enough but something held me back, or im chicken, one of the two.
but anyway
He's going to the Ski hill this weekend, and I am too.  What a coincidence!   Yeah so I suppose I am excited.  I will be much more excited as Saturday approaches.  I hope this will get things going.  I hope we actually hang out on Saturday.  MAN!

Im not thrilled about going to Spooner on Friday for the Boys' game tomorrow.  I guess I should be more excited.  It just doesn't seem that real yet, but I am sure I will get some troller spirit soon enough.

I took a run today to four corners and back.  It was ok.  I did ok.  I ran about half the way and walked the other half on account of my asthma and back.  I feel fat and lathargic and NOT ready for soccer, but HEY!  i'll get better....i hope.

Well.  I have sort of a dilemma.  More of a disturbance.  More of a annoyance.  More of a ponderous happening.   I talk to someone online every once in a while.  And Lately this person has been kinda trying to step up how well we kno each other, which is ok, i always love getting to kno someone new.  But the thing is this person goes to our school, and I feel REALLY weird around him at school cus we don't really talk offline.  He says he is too scared to talk to me, and doesn't know what to say and I certainly don't really wanna strike up a conversation.  But sometimes i think:   Why don't i just say something?! It might break the ice, make it easier for the both of us.   But I guess since there is already this tension I am hesitant.  Whenever I see him its just like oh man, there he is, and he isnt saying anything and Im definitely not Either!  Dont get the wrong impression, I don't LIKE him or anything, but i do think he may secretly like me.  Which is a nice thought because NO ONE ever likes me, but he just isn't my type (and i have this whole atom thing).  I donno ithe issue has just has been bothering me kinda lately.  Especially cus he talks to me all the time now.  All my friends  (the chicks) just have blocked him,  and I definetly don't want to that cus that is just plain Mean but I don't want him to think i want to be best friends or more.  I donno. Im just blabbering.

Lets see.  I really like Band tech right now.  I just do Finale and listen to online radio on Itunes.  It has been my fav source for new music and have been getting into Snow Patrol, Postal service, Death cab for Cutie etc.  Maybe im getting out of the dumb pop punk, which along with the OC, potato chips, and chick flicks  I am really ashamed to admit that I like.  

I have been on a Reading spree lately:

""This Lullaby""  by Sarah Dressen.   The greatest book EVER!  I started it on Valentines cus i need to lose myself in some kind of love story, even if it was a book.   Tore through that, cus I had read it before and was somewhat bored with it.  But it was still a great story.  I love the guy.  He was in a band,  a dorky lanky black curly hair.  TOTALLY exactly my type!

""That Summer""  also by Sarah Dressen.  Didn't really like it.  It was about a young girl.  14.  There was also an awesome guy in there but nothing romantic happened and it was mostly about her relationship with her sister which was kinda boring.

""Summer at Castle Auburn""  I donno who wrote it.  It is Lesley's favorite book, hannah recommended it too.  Although it started out slowly it was SO good.  I was so happy when i ended it.  It was one of those romantic fairly tales but it had some twists that were quite unexpected, but ended up in the same ""happily ever after"" ending.  

I just really tore through all of these, which was crazy cus when do I have time to read?!  I think i may go back to some classics.  My dad has a whole treasure of Steinbeck.  He read every single book he wrote, which is really cool.  

For English i have settle on the Great Gatsby since I have read Old man in the sea, and the pearl.  The pearl is a really short and simple book, it kinda seems dwarfed by the other books in my opinion.   Although i read it in 7th grade and may have not gotten any of the symbolism.

I feel spring coming on!  I see light at the end of the proverbial tunnel that is Winter.  I am getting antsy and ready for there to be grass and green, and open water.  Weeks  do seem to go by quickly, as i get sucked into assignments and the flow of a school day. So I guess I can make it through this long waiting period called March and April.  But I really would wish something exciting would happen! I REALLY DO!   But the schoool year is almost 3/4 over!  That is insane.  This year has flown bye!  I will be bussing at maggies in NO time at all.  I so much to do, college and ACTs and Band and forensics, and school and soccer.   All this junk just keeps those days going quickly though.  

Sometimes I can't even believe that i am 17.  It seems that just yesterday I was like 10.  I remember the moment that I realized that THIS was my life.  I remember realizing ""hey this is me,  im not watching some kind of movie, or just standing by, this is ME!""  I was kinda scared and surprised and worried that I wasn't cool enough.  LIke my childhood is almost over!

Today when I took a run, I thought about when i go college.  If I get sick, my mom won't be there to take care of me.  I will have to decide on my own if I should go to class or not, when it is severe enough to cop out on commitment.  IT just kinda blew my mind.

Anwho That was a ton!  i guess i just needed to do some ""stream of consciousness"" writing.  I have decided that is my natural tendency when it comes to writing.  I skip from thought to thought, anecdote to anecdote in a long stream.

Speaking of.   We dissected Worms today.  I always luck out and get awesome specimens and I am a great dissector.  Maybe I should be a doctor.  Right now I am thinking along the lines of ecology or naturalist.   But I have also decided that I really really like kids and definetly want to be involved with them."

Last night my mom yelled at me about playing my solo ""EVERY DAY"" but im fairly confident that she is on some new drugs that make her insane. I guess I should be playing my solo more so that when it comes down to crunch time I won't be freaking...........But everyone knows I will be anyway....

Well Lets see.  I am at a moral delema.  The Boys play in Spooner on Friday, but I was hoping to make my big move with atom this weekend.  Now I am going back and fourth whether I should just screw the game or what..
Also I told Liz Woodworth that I would babysit and I would love to get out of that but I feel bad.  

Me and Caite (CAIIITEE)  were in the newpaper for the PRom Dress exchange at the library.  I felt bad because we were the only ones that went besides leesy and Sandy.  Still It was really fun and I got Sarah's frosh dress.  It fits me really really awesome, but I don't kno if it is unique enough for JUNIOR PROM. I hope that I spice it up a bit.  Or just save it for Next year, or SOMETHING!  And I suppose I have vowed not to have a date unless it is a REAL LIVE date, which I doubt will happen.  Maybe Catie will even come with me to prom.  She was suppose to come for Homecoming but couldn't make it. 

I think my asthma is back just in time for soccer season.  I also hurt my back, pulled some muscles or soemthing and it is somewhat painful.  It keeps me from going to captains practise, which I feel bad about.  I really wish I could be a captain!!  

Took a crazy chem test this morning I hope I do well.  I hope Eli passed which i assume he did because we are having a forensics practise this week.  I had a crazy dream about him:

There was this party at my house and we were all playin hide and seek all night, and i found him and he told me to go looking for these shoe laces, and if I got the most red ones it meant that he loved me, but if I found enough blue ones he would be sad, and so on and so fourth with the colors.  So I went around and found a TON of red ones so then he came back the next day and i was locked in the shed with Michael so we decided that since I found all the red ones he would love me.  Then I woke up.

ONly 3 weeks until spring break YAY~!

There were stupid snares on the whole time, which pissed me off a bunch but im just glad I got through it.  I had a trying day on Monday when someone stole like 100$ from my locker, and then i had a lil breakdown.

I can actually take a break tomorrow!!! Yippee.  I can focus on school again, and then come home and be totally lazy!

Gotta start Gearing up for soccer! YESS!! OMG I AM SOOO Excited!

I feel like we are finally on the downside of winter, although we still have like 100 ft of snow.  I can actually start to see the light in the end of the tunnel which makes me really really excited.  Looking forward to summer, and green, and warmth, and end of this crazy insane year!

 Got some sweet Classic Vans.  They are kinda crazy black and red checkered but I like them.   I think they are just on the brink of being ugly but thats how i like it.  Thats my style I guess.

NOW that every single one of my friends are ""taken"" (except Chelsey...does she count?)  it makes me feel very odd.  And I suppose it is a catalyst to my sad and hopeless folly over a certain particle.  I guess I am just gonna give it a chance and see what happens.  Watever.

Sucked in soccer today.  I couldn't breath and therefor didn't play well at all.  I was very mad.  Angry and disapointed and emberessed to name a few other emtions.  I AM SO TIRED!

"event","Well lets see....
Homecoming.  Extremely stressful.  Crazy insane, but in the scheme of things it is nothing!  I mean right now Britt is reveling in his clean sweep of the whole week, but this time next year when he is off in San Fran inventing Google... He isn't even going to remember homecoming..
So I just gotta think that I won't even care about it either.  Not that I was really disappointed in the outcome this year.  
There were only two things which I had a major problem with

A.   The Hallway was awesome;  It was a super cool theme and there were some great things in it.  BUT
We only had like 5 people working on it the whole week Robin, me, Tara, Elise, Eli.  We were slaving like every free moment while others Watched the basketball game, or went home.  I think it could have been a lot better if we would have planned it out together (not just robin doing whatever he wanted) and had more people woking on it.   We were robbed yet another year.....

B.  I went to the dance with Forrest.  Bad idea.  First of All Catie Cogger from washburn was suppose to come with me backed out.  I don't know what forrest was thinking but he was almost as bad as date as Mark was.  I don't understand that kid.  He didn't dance with me,  on fast or slow songs.    I guess he either had NO clue what to do, or he is a dumbass...  i could believe either.  That will just teach me to never have a date unless someone really asks me.  Which is highly doubtful.   Yeah Joe stole our table at Maggies.  But it wasn't really his fault.  It was pretty much Kate Sweval's fault, who I will eternally hate forever.....


All in all it was a great week though.  It sure beat having work.  And not having school yesterday was even better!!!  It was great.  Except for the fact that I am now sick and I feel like crap.  Trying to recooperate.  I have about 20 million vitimins in my system right now.


Thats it.  Better go work on some biology.."

"event","I find myself here again.  I am drawn to coming back here to stare at a blank screen, but i never really have anything good to talk about.  As of now I am having my nightly meeting with Luke and Pete and listening to Trumpet Concertos.... Although the CD keeps skipping and it is pissing me off.  I don't much like Baroque (or however you spell it).  
I am really full I ate way too much for dinner.  I have like 500 bruises from sunday soccer.  Damn Rowen Nelson!  He kicked me and then was like ""Get shin gaurds.""

I find myself in a quandry about homecoming.  To invite a date or not to invite a date.  To take a chance or not to take a chance.  To be or not to be.  To wait for someone to ask me or to take the bull by the horns. To put my hair up or down.  So many questions.  All of which don't matter in the slightest that I am worrying about way too much.

I am totally freaking out about trumpet.  I have good days like ""hells yeah I am the shit."" and then really sucky days like ""I couln't play British eighth all the way to save my life"" while sitting next to old iron lips Graham who is like a frikin machine.  Damn.  And it doesn't help Hannah telling cutesy boyfriend stories about him either.  It makes him almost human.  Not to mention my extremely wierd relationship with WEnz.  It is so weird, im scared of him, but not.  I like him, but not.  hes nice to me but not.

Oo and guess what.  My mom asked me if I was gay tonight.  Granted I was watching Will and Grace my favorite show (cus its on back to back from 530-700)  but it still was like ""WTF.""  Just cus i'm having a lil problem getting the guys.......or never have been able to in my whole life...
who knows.  im glad she wasn't all serious about it and was like ""What is your sexual preference..""  That would have been even weirder.  I don't know it was just kinda outta the blue.


Dude.  I am going to Ashland to play Pep band on Thrusday night.  I am excited!
For a Hockey game!!


There was dog poop in the Gym at practise today.  
Just thought I would share that amusing nugget (HA..... pun)

Well thats it.  I am friking pooped (ha nother pun)

Im starving!  But my goal is to fit in my homecoming dress so......
Played Sunday soccer today.  My team always loses.  It really sucks.   BUT HEY!
I talked to atom!  Kinda asked him out....
Told him we should hang out and he said ""we will""
Hells yeah!

Im trying not to get too excited cus that could just be total bull crap, and I donno if anything will ever happen.  I really really really really want something to happen.

I might ask forrest to homecoming, but I am still not sure

I had about 19 people over at my house on Friday night.  It was great fun, except for the fact that we were all getting really cozy.  It doesn't have the same excitement as it use to, maybe it never did.  i think that maybe when we were younger we were exstatic about just watching movies with a bunch of people.   Now I just want way more exciting stuff to happen.  Get a little crazy and hilarious.  I guess that may be hard without alcohol but we dont kick it like that, and never have.

During the day on Saterday I went to Ashland to get Black shoes for band.  I also picked up the Awesomeist pink pumps for homecoming.  They were only 10$ and they match my Dress LIKE PERFECTLY!  i am excited about those.  I also got a new CD and I am ashamed to say its Ryan Cabrerra.  I was gonna get Tyler Hilton but I went out on a whilm and got Rran.  Its good, but not like Dashboard or Something corporate.  I guess its one of those ones that you can fall asleep to on the Basketball Bus, which is cool.  I hung out with my Best friend Laura from Ashland.  We ate at the golden Glow, and just caught up on FLIP things.    I heart her.


Saterday Night was Washburn ""Sweeties"" and I kept my scedule open just in case i was invited, but I wasn't so I stayed home all alone.  Oh well...  I am definetly hanging out next weekend with them.

I am gonna go play pep band in Ashland on Thursday night for a hockey game.  Im excited!

Other than that I am really really boring

there were couples saunaing
Damn those couples. 
I mean who saunas?  Honestly!
Why cant we all just hang out together, why does it have to be a couple thing ALL the time?
I have no idea whats going on anymore.

Soccer was fun but I didn't really do that well. 
Saw Adam, but again didn't say anything.  Schooled him up a couple of times...
I'm really cool.  NOT!
one day i am just gonna call him up and ask him out so this stupid little piece of false hope in my brain is shattered for good!  (Have I said that b4?  Probably, but It is so true)

I pretty much spent my whole sunday with a blithering idiot.. But that is all I am going to say about it because I got in trouble for it last time..
Lizzie *cough cough*
Whooh i must be getting some kinda cold....

I was so psyked to do something way fun tonight.  I just wantched Mean girls with LIzzie and Carina.
I am acheing for some kind of excitement and drama, and nervousness, and giddyness.
HEll its January, I guess I can't be too hopeful.
But I JUST WISH!!!!

A whole new phase of my life has just  begun I think.  It is no longer me leaving my friends because of another agenda.  It is them leaving me.  It just feels so weird.  And I am sure I am taking this really hard, but i am the only one who doesn't have a bf.  And its making me have an intense want of one.. Which isn't even logical?! I DONT need one, or want one.  but there is this new pressure of needing to have one.  My brain knows that I really dont need one, but my ""heart"" doesn't.  I am usually able to control myself with my logic and brain but not this time.  or at least right now.

I am suppose to know stuff about this kind of thing.  I am suppose to be logical and intellegent, and not get sucked in.  Congrats I am sucked in... not to mention i just plain suck..

Hmmmmmmm
I should go to bed

"event","I am in such a weird place right now.  I feel like I am floundering in the water.  Not really going anywhere, just suspended.  I'm thrashing around and trying so hard to move, but my brain just doesn't have the will to put fourth the effort needed to coordinate myself.  This pretty much explains my whole life right now: Basketball, friends, relationships, even school believe it or not.  

It is so frusterating.  My friends and I have entered a whole new phase of friendship.  Where boyfriends are more of the equasion than anything eles.  When we have a girls movie night, it turns into an ""Invite the Boyfriends over.""  I suppose it really  isn't their faults, or mine, it just happened.  I try to talk to them and tell them how I feel about it, and they say they get it  but I really think they dont.  I have this intense feeling of rejection, uglyness, and aloneness.  And I know this Really isnt logical AT ALL, but I cant get past it.  And I know it just sort of Happened this way and it really isnt me but I can't help feeling there is something wrong with me.  And I guess I can't really do anything about it cus there isn't anyone out there for me.  I mean little particle...... prolly not.  And I am somewhat convinced that I am way too good for him anyway so says creeping plant.   But there is still that little thought in the corner of my brain.  I want to just do something drastic like ask him out just to subdue my stupid false hope.  Just get it out of my head as an option.  Move on.  BUt that is a different issue.  To Whom shall I move?  No one here obviously.  Washburn?  I donno.

Basketball.  I am just bad at it.  I don't try, I don't focus, I am to timid.  I am not use to being bad at something for a change.  I find myself unbelievably jealous of Chels and Led, and resentful of their being good at everything.  I really would like to step it up, try harder, give more effort, become more focused, confident, and have fun.  I need to play bigger.  I just don't know if I have it in me.  Do I even want to?
And then my parents talk to me about comittment and loyalty.  And I do know I owe it to  myself to stay on the team.  I really couldn't imagine not playing.  I mean rick has helped me SOO much, to drop it would be not right.    They say  that in the long run I will look back and see how much i enjoyed being part of a team and having fun with my friends.  I could be doing other things though,  I dont know if I am happy.
I like to compete, and challenge myself.  And that isn't happening.  Perhaps I am distancing myself because I don't want my bad attitude to come back.  All in all I just have to play harder and be more serious.  Step up my intensity.  Big task but It will be my goal.


School.. Finals are over.  My brain is fried.  1/2 a year to go.  Just waiting until the horrible scores of my tests come in.Wow

Well that is all right now.  I kina just vented everything, and it prolly isnt understandable cus I am just babbling.oh welll

It was really fun until Jerry came and yelled at us.  People were going to come over and play board games, but they called at the last minute and said they were going out to a bonfire at the Burg's.
I guess it is for the best because I am starting to feel wierd around them.  They are all couplish and seeing as though I am the only one thats not a ""couple""  it doesn't bode well.  Maybe I am just overeacting because I guess nothing specific has happened where I was kinda left out, but it just feels like that. 

I need to go over to Washburn, but Jessie keeps forgetting to call me.  I guess no one wants to hang out with me.
I am leaving for Madison on Friday to spend New Years.  My Uncle has a gig in MacFarland (wherever that is) and we are gonna go down there I guess.  Staying in a super 8.... yipee

I guess getting out of town for a few days won't be bad for me either.  Except for the fact that I kinda want to be around my home b4 we go back to school.  Oh my god I do not want to go back!  We have finals and the end of the semester and homecoming and a bunch of CRAP coming up that I have no desire to deal with.  Plus I donno I am sick of everything and need to get away and hang out with new people.

My cousin got like 50 PS2 games and spent the whole day playing them.  My four year old twin cousins were not feeling well, so I couldn't play with them.  I said two words to my cousin Spencer who is a senior.  So I pretty much played ping pong and foosball with a six year old and got beat by the way.  And I hung out with my uncles grandsons, whom I think are extra hott.  They are like 12, 10, and 7......  They also all had a PS2 and each had a gameboy advanced so they didn't want to play.  Yeah No one wanted to hang out with me.... it sucked.

So guess what I did when I got home.  I played PS2.  The one and only game I am good at is SSX Tricky.  It was fun. A great waste of about 2 hours.

Then I got my dad's car stuck in my driveway.  But then I got to pull it out with the truck!!! Which was really masculine and fun.  Then I plowed the driveway so no one else would get stuck.  Which is also a blast.  And then I shoveled the walk with a broken shovel.... not so much a blast.

Tomorrow I am gonna have Christmas with my Mom's family. I am looking forward to it. But I know what I got for christmas already so it won't be a big suprise
Examine this handy list:
* the items marked with a star are the ones that I know I am getting but haven't formally gotten them yet

Jacket (I got it about a month ago)
Backpack*
Soccer ball
indoor soccer shoes (got them 3 weeks ago)
Speaker system that hooks to my ipod (very handy)
LOTR Return of the Kings (its still in the mail, my dad ordered it like a month ago but it hasn't come in yet)*
Trivial Persuit 90s edition *
Soccer shirt*
Soccer shirt from yumeri (that is way too small, so I can just look at it longingly)
soccer socks*
belt*
Two new sweatshirts from Zumies (one of which is too small)*.5
I really nice Badger fleece from my dad's side family (which is too big)

That is it so far.... But I haven't formally had christmas yet.  I did with my dad, but not with my mom
Did anyone notice a trend?
Yup everything was too small
Working on that.
Went to the rec center on Thursday. Pumped iron and then was sore for two days. 
Going there tomorrow to do the same thing.  I plan to be buff and skinny by homecoming.
It really isn't working.  I am just screwing with my eating habits. Hopefully I will get a handle on it b4 school starts again.

I guess that is it.
Didn't get a puppy or a car.
But I am not really that disappointed about that.
I have actually been thinking a lot about my dog lately.  I really miss him.

I will work on that, but as for right now I don't feel very cool or hott, or anything really.
I need to get out of my comfort zone again, meet people, be crazy.   I don't think that will happen until after then new year.  I definetly am going to reevuate myself over break and make some major changes.  

Yeah, I am feeling somewhat discontent to say the least right now. I am just holding on until after school is out and I can have time to stop and think a little.

Went to Green Bay this weekend to see the game.  I was so incredibly cold.  It ws like -10!!!!! I couldn't feel my feet.  I got to miss school today because we got back so late last night.  We were gonna stay in a hotel but decided to just go all the way home.  We got in at 1am, but I slept in until like 12 today so its all good.  I also made christmas cookies that turned out bad cus you can't really tell what shape they are suppose to be in. I also got the coolest christmas cards ever! 

Bball is wierd.  I can do better I know I can...  I donno....

I am dropping atom I guess. He has too many electrons and is way depressed.  I use to think he was interested but I guess he isn't.  I suppose I let him know that I was, and he can iether take it or leave it.  But I am not going to really think at all about it anymore.. or even talk to him for that matter.

Well I guess it is late and I should go.  I have the last day of school before break to look forward to.  And acutally I am.  I am looking forward to partying and watching christmas movies.

There has got to be a law against that.  All I do all week  is bust my butt so that i can get to the weekend, and when it finally rolls around I sit and watch ""what not to wear"" and wonder if I should go on that show.  I think I would be better on like ""extreme makeover.""  I would never have plastic surgury or anthing drastic like that, but I would get a really crazy personal trainer who would make me do like 1 million sit ups and not let me eat anything.  And then when people saw me they would like faint...

Speaking of eating we had our Band Party today.  I totally pigged out on ""chessa cookies"" and chips and I still feel like shit.  My body isn't use to ingesting junk food.  I eat so damn healthy its almost sad, yet I still insist on being overweight.  I just can't win can I?

Especially with a certain tiny particle.  I have had no contact for over two weeks, regardless of the nucleus attraction there just must be too many energy levels....
GOD DAMN FRANCIUM!!!!!!!!!
And its not like I want to just give up.  Last time I talked to him it seemed like we really had a heart to heart, but I guess not.  And the fact that he hasn't tried to contact me at all isn't encoureging at all.. I guess I can take a signal...
but with him it is so hard to kno if it is one or not...

Well, now I suppose you want to know what is going on with me.  First of all school is the hardest it has ever been for me.  I have to stay attentive, orginized, and logical to tackle the magnatude of everyday assignments.  Don't get me started on large projects....

I am also spending much of my time playing basketball, which has still got me frusterated.  This year because I seem to be not good enough to contribute.  My floor time in the game varies, to one minute against LCO to two quarters in Mercer.  I just don't feel confident enough.  My dad says I need to be way more confident.  He says that on the soccer field I stut around like I own the field, and I need to do that in basketball (in this case I would own the court..).  I agree, but it is hard when you aren't a key part of the team.  Don't get me wrong I have accepted my role on the team and it doesn't hinder me from having fun or even working hard, but it deminishes my confidence.

Other than school and basketball I do not do much eles.
I have recently gotten a dry erase board where I seperate my life into three catagories.  ""important,"" ""homework,"" and ""This week.""  On one had it is really great that I have everything down visually to keep me more orginized.  Other times it is sad to see that I have to keep so close of tabs on my comings and goings.

My passion is still soccer.  I just got some indoor soccer shoes and I am excited to use them on the gym floor.  I am going to be in a winter indoor league after the new year.  I also am reading an autobiography by Mia Hamm which has inspired me as an athlete and as a soccer player.  

In the social relm I have been fairly close to the girls lately which is nice.  I also enjoy going over to washburn to hang out and meet new people.  It is just like getting away from the norm and my ""comfort  zone.""  Over there I can be anyone I want to be, and they are suprizingly acceptive and eager to meet new people as well.  

I have had my eye on a certain very tiny particle for a while now, but he is really depressed.  I suppose you could say that he is an ion negatively charged.  He also is somewhat stable because he never wants to exert the energy to bond with anthing (me).  I just keep telling myself that ""Atoms bond to become more stable,"" and he definetly needs to be more stable. And I totally think I would be so good for him, but I think it make take a while.  I haven't even talked to him in about two weeks and so I don't really know what is up with him.  I seriuosly think we have a lot in common and could be great together.  I always ask him to hang out and he always turns me down, reasoning that he ""just doesn't ever feel like doing anything"" and as far as I can gather it doesn't have to do with me personally.  I really don't know what to do.  Earier I got very strong signals that he was interested in me, and I was so excited, but he still never wanted to do anything.  People tell me that he is really depressed right now and doesn't want to hang out with anyone.  I did go to his house for a party and it was really fun.  We flirted a bit, but he was also flirting with everyone eles too so I donno.

Hmmmmmmmmm.  Christmas is quickly approaching.  I am going to the packer game next weekend.  I am really exciting. Any trip to the mecca is collosal.
I have to get through this next week first."

"event","Well Look at me, I am actually updating my livejournal. How suprising!?

It is October already.  The leaves are outstanding, soccer is over, and school has no end in sight.  What an unbelievably depressing time...
Actually I am pretty content at the moment.  I am getting to know washburn people which is really fun.  I even might have an interest in a certain 
""speed of a very small particle""  if you know what I mean.....
I am really excited about that much.  I think there might be mutual interest as well!  We will just have to take it one weekend at a time though.  I promised myself I am gonna go for it, but there is no sense rushing it.

I got two 88% on tests this week!  It really threw me for a loop.  The spanish test was really hard and mine was the best in the class, and the geometry I just made some stupid mistakes.

Jesus its monday!  I dont know how I am gonna last through this week without totally going crazy! Atom!"

School is school.  I pretty much flunked a spanish test as well as a Biology two test, after I studied all night last night.  
I have also been playing soccer.  I pulled my Hamstring last night and tonight it bothered me at soccer practise and I dont think I am gonna go to the U19 game tomorrow.  I gotta let my leg heal.  

My grandpa is in the hospital.  He really isnt doing very well and I don't know what to think.  My mom is a mess.  I want to feel really sad and disturbed but I can't really.  It is kinda like my grandpa Walt dieing.  I didnt  really feel anything.  I dont know I feel bad that I dont feel anything.

Tonight at soccer was fun.  Lately I have felt really really lathargic so I went to boys' practise.  I totally want to hate Matt G but he was really nice to me during practise so I guess I cant Hate him.  But I don't easily trust him.  I guess he is allright.

Timmy OPatic goes to Bayfield now.  I went to the demo derby with him and tyler this summer and he turned out to be a really cool kid.  I see some potention maybe??  We will have to see.  I dont want to jump the gun whatever I do.  

I really need to get my ipod working! That is my goal for this weekend hopefully, along with understanding chemestry.  And I have to Dang work! and I dont want to at all!!!!!

Well I Guess I dont ahve anything more to say.

"event","I went to the boys game tonight, that was fun.  I played soccer with the U14 team after the game.  I think I love soccer!  I just Love! IT!  I could play it forever!
I think I am starting plan: Chessa getting in shape....
how  many times have I tried to institute this?  Probably a billion....
I have decided I eat way too much.  I need to run, which is covered when I play soccer as long as I keep playing.  And I have started a sit up routine that is semi-effective.  I guess I gotta just keep with it, but I think that my technique is a little bit off.  

School is gearing up.  I am ready I think.  I am looking forward to the flip field trip which will be on Sept. 14. I have yet to decide where it will be.

I started Wuthering Hights by Emily Bronte last night.  I had tried many times in the last week to start it but the language in it is so confusing but I think I get the gist of it.  I heard it is such a good book so I am excited to get into it!  It was on my summer reading list but I failed to read it.  
This summer I read Ferenheit 451, the lovely bones, davince code, and Fellowship of the rings.  I thought that was pretty good since i was so busy.  OO I also read this awesome book called the Death and Life of Charlie St. Claire.  Best book EVER!  I also love e.e. cummings;  his poetry is awesome!

I really like all the foreign exchange students a lot!  I want to try to do something with them this weekend but I think I have to work.  Dangit all to heck I dont want to work!

My ipod would have come in today but the fed ex guy couldn't leave it at my house without someone there.  I will get it tomorrow.  YES! I am importing all of my Cds tonight.  My goal is to have 1000 songs.  Which would be most of my cds plus the songs that I have downloaded.  I think I will be somewhere around 8 or 9 hundred though.  I think it can hold 5000 so I am hoping that I will get that  many eventually.
i am so proud of myself for making enough money to splirge on it!  I worked so hard the week before school started I think i worked like 7  shifts in the last week!  I also paid for all of my school stuff.  Man am I money savvy!

I guess that is all that I have to say.  I am just wasting time while my cds import.  Right now I am importing Moby.  I actuallyl dont think it is my cd, and I dont know where I got it.  To tell the truth I haven't even listened to it before.  But I know Moby is vegan, and anyone who is vegan is ok by me!
Me and Hayley decided my diet was vatkins because it is half vegan half atkins.  It is a good way of putting it.

Hmm this Moby stuff is interesting.  I dont know if I like this techno type of stuff that much.... 
Maybe it will grow on me.

Well that is it for now, I am gonna go read
Catch u on the flip side

 What can I say.. I took the summer off,of writing so sue me!
Well the year has started, summer is gone over done with.  DAMNIT!  I guess I am ready to get down to buisness and start studying

I ordered an ipod and I can't wait till it comes in.  I totally need it after the summer of work and no cd player.

Well I guess I gotta go do some sit ups.  I have started a routine.  I do about 100 -150 each  night but since I was on a trip I didnt do them and I am feeling very guilty!  My stomache still looks like shit though.  Hopefully this will help.

"event","Well now.  Its tuesday night.  Went down town and took the rest of my roll of 200, then came back up and used the telephoto lense to take some photos in the garden.  
I got a pint of Banana soy ice cream with pecans and chocolate swirl.  It was so dang good.  I  got into a big discussion on religion with Catie.  We talked about how fundimentalism was bad, and about how we hardly knew ourselves much less what deity we believed in.  So that was really interesting.

My finger is getting better, but already I just want to rip this bandage off!  Tomorrow we are going canoeing and I guess I am just going to be sitting in the boat not able to canoe.  But I guess that is alright with me.

About this whole guy issue again.  If I really want some ""action"" I should just get out and meet some.  I mean its not like I live in the Cities or anything so I cant go ""clubbing"" like Alla, Rob's dreamboat lil abbers girl from St. Paul, HA SO FUNNY!  Anywho
I guess I can just start slowly but I don't think I would ever go up to a guy and be like ""Howdy""
DUDE What am I talking about, I seriously have no idea so I am just going to stop, this train of thought is going nowhere.

President Bush was in Duluth today while we were there.  Meg wanted to get out and protest which would have been interesting but we just kept the big red bus going north.  Politics are totally messed up!  

Lemme see here.......
I guess that must be it, maybe I will come back and write more later

Hey KIDS.  Ahh life is good.  I just came off of four days off and I feel so relaxed and summery.   The other day Me, My mom, Michelle and Isaac went to Little Sand Bay to the ""hidden beach.""  While Isaac and I were tooling around exploring we found this really awesome little cove with tree roots hanging down and water dripping and stuff.  I had a brilliant idea that this area would make awesome ""artsy photoghraphs""  So today I took my 35mm (camara, not gun, is thre such a thing?)  and took some awesome artsy photographs.  

So on my way out of town I decided to stop at the library to check out the ""Divinci Code"" and return some other books.  I get in there and there is this incredibly attractive guy there talking to Teresa about when you can play that Pink Floyd song along with the Wizard of Oz.  I totally thought he was ""hott"" (in my opinion, i tend to like wierd guys)  and totally thought I saw him again walking around town.  I actually think i am going to talk to teresa and ask her who he is.  Lol not like i would call him up or anything, or would I 
""Hi, you dont know me, but I saw you in the library once checking out pink floyd and wizard of oz.  Could you maybe come over and show me how it works...""
DUDE I am such a loser!
But I am sick of being alone.  
I mean No Dog, No guy, what the hell am I good for!?!

Dang I am really sorry that I always blabber on about guys but U kno, what eles is there to talk about on here.  There is nothing eles going on in my life except for flip.  I am keeping a different Journal on that.  Maybe if I get really bored I will transfur it onto here, which would be really cool acutally.

Anyway back to the beach.  SO as i was swimming around, with my bad hand in the air mind you, I see this thing in the water.  At first I thought it was a log, but it was moving too fast to be a log and it had a head and it was moving around.  So I wade over closer to where it was swimming to shore, and determined that it was a deer swimming for Sand island to the mainland.  As it came to shore I lost sight of it, and kinda wondered if i was right or if it was just a log.  So I pack up my stuff and am ready to head down the beach when it starts swimming over to the beach.  So I throw down my stuff and load the camara up quick with 200 film and run into the water and start snappin photos of this deer.  I think i got about 10 of then and it started swimmin the other way along the shore.  I felt bad because it was prolly really tierd from swimming all the way over here and it needed to get on dry land, but I am sure it came back to the beach once I was gone.  I pondered sitting and waiting for it to come back and then jumpin up and getting more candid shots but the flies were really bad and I was ready to go home.

So there you have it folks, the whole story.  GOOD AyE?
well I am out, gotta be to FLIP really early tomorrow

Granted I am always bitching on here about guys, but what can I say.  I was watching MTV and on like TRUE STORIES this obese girl had a guy.  I  MEAN WHAT THE FUCK! I seriously think there must be something wrong with me.  
I guess there just arn't any guys up here.  But Damn I wish there were.  Total in my dating career I have had two totally messed up not even real relationships.  The first was a wacko the second one I got played.  So i dont even think they even count.  And I  mean now I am like almost constantly thinking about how retarded I must be.  It doesn't help that all my friends are like ""hotties"" ither I guess.

Anyway on to different news.

I totally believe in Ghosts and UFOs.  There have been to many unexplained happenings for ghosts to be fake, and the universe is so damn big there has to be life somewhere eles.

Ummers.  My goal for the summer is to get my flip pal ROB to like think i am the shit.  I need to get all of the flippers to love me, so we can all hang out after flip is over.

Damnit.  I never have anything cool to say.  Oh well

I know it has been a long time.  I mean it has been even a long time for me...
I just got back from a FLIP camping trip.  We stayed in the middle of a wolf research center in tents, we heard all the wolves howling and it was SOOOO cool.  
I also worked 5 days this week at maggies.  We did 250 on the 5th.  Talk about Crazy.
What I really want to talk about is the HOTT HOTT dishwasher.  He is from like slovakia and he is so increadibly hott.   There are two of them.  The night dishwasher is just like ""european guy"" hott, but the Day dishwasher is sooo my type.  He has cool glasses, long hair w. ponytail, and vans.  I had a dream that I started talkin to him but he totally rejected me cus he said I was too young.. go figure.
I have actually been dreaming about maggies a lot, it prolly cus i spend my life there...
But about this guy, I havent even talked to him, or even met him.  But we got a lil eye contact stuff goin on, unless it is my imaginations which it totally could be
WHOA
I gotta go to bed I am blabbering not using punctuation and I gotta get up really early tomorrow CAtch uz on the FLIP side, ha ha double meaning whoa yeah gotta fly nightie night"

Tomorrow I have to work and I am kinda bummed out.  It being fourth of july and all.  I get time and a half though which is aweosme.  I will prolly end up makin like over 12$ an hour.
And I am off in time to have a cook out and watch the Works con my pals.  

I got a warped tour 04 compilation cd  set for 10$ can you believe that?!  That is like 5$ a cd.  and each of them have like 25 songs on them! you cant go wrong with taht, PLUS they are awesome songs, and i can experiance new bands that I dont really kno much about, without buying their cd.  I just couldnt believe tht.


I just got some new hiking shoes for work and FLIP.  They are really really comfortable. I also got some silver jeans, which are really comfortable for like really cheap.  I am such a good bargin hunter.

Crap.  I could totally babble on about flip, but I dont really feel like it. 

My LOTR box is soooo frikin awesome.  It has the fellowship's shadows on the back, THE EYE of Sauron on the inside, elven poem inside, mountains on the front, and the ring is halfway done, and the door of the Mines of Moria on one side,  The emblem of Gondor is going to be on the other side.  I think Sting is also gonna be in there, or eles Anduril if I can find a good pic of it. Anyway, none of my friends think it is cool but it is seriously the coolest artsy thing i have been doin in like my whole life.


Yeah I am gonna go and find somethign to do I guess.

"event","I am really sick of guys in General never liking me.  I Mean I dont have a sign that says ""Hey dont consider me.""  I admit that I am no super model, but I am ""kinda cute"" and you'd think could get a guy once in a while.  I mean girls way the hell uglier than me are getting tons of guys....
I dont know.  It just annoys me.  There is this potential guy in FLIP, but I am not even gonna try at this point because it is unpheesable.  He is already being pulled toward the ""hott girl""  so I guess you kno.  I guess on one hand I am not really looking for like that kinda stuff from FLIP, but I guess I am looking in general, and that is the only other source of people that I get.  I mean Bayfield is a No, and I have no idea where eles I am gonna find anyone eles.  I am just sick of never ever ever ever getting like a look from a guy.  No interest whatsoever.  I totally had a stronger argument earlier, but I have seemd to have forgotten it, probably cus I am really tierd.  So i will continue this when i make sense....

Had another fun filled week of FLIP. I just love all those guys.  We have so much fun and make up so many inside jokes.  Some night when i feel like typing and am really bored I will name them all *mostly because they are all really in depth and take lots of backroound info.

I am attempting LOTR again.  Its even better the second time, although i am not out of the Shire Yet.  

My mom is working on a box for the CBAC auction, so i decided to make one too.
I actually have two goin, one big one that I keep my treasure/nicknacks from old trips and meaningful events in, and one small one.  The big one is red, and the lil one is black with red inside.  The lil one I am gonna do a LOTR thing I think with the writing from the ring, and a lil painting of it on there.  and myabe the Door to the mines of Moria, or just the trees.

The big one I am gonna put some quotes on, i think LOTR but maybe not.  On the inside I am goin to decopadge cool pics and mag clippings.

I have also started a series of drawings of my dog.   It all started while I was suppose to be sudying for finals and my cat happened to be sitting on the table with me.  I started to draw him and it just evolved from there.   My mom said it was pretty good, and it gave me a confidence boost and an interest.  Now each night I draw my dog in whatever position she happens to be in.  Sleeping, loungin, begging.  (Most with aid of a cheese stick, unless she is sleeping.)  I am gettin better and better every night.  I have actually found out that I am a pretty natural artist... go figure aye.. I guess i must have some artist genes in there afterall, my parents are actually rubbing of, how funny....
I like it.  My mom cratiques and shows me how i can get better.  They really show the emotion of Izzy at the time that I draw her, lil rusty on the proportion and line quality, but I will get better.

Well all for now.  I am really tierd, but I dont have to get up tomorrow

"event","Wow it is way totally late.  I should be tucked into bed like a good Lil girl because I have to get up at like 5:50 tomorrow.  But I am here, glued to my computer.  Work was great tonight.  I like working at Maggies it is fun, and way good money.  Last week I made 60 bucks for only 6 hours.  Thats like 10$ an hour :O WHOA!
I also am having a blast at FLIP.  The people are awesome and we have so much fun.   We made up this roadkill game where you get points for different road kill.   We also had a pool one lunch hour of what a watermelon weighed.  Jason won with 15lbs (it was 13.5).  The best part was that we were all off, and wen he  said 15 we were like ""watever, no way.""  We also all got tatoos, and have determined we are in a gang.

"event","Once settled into Summer, I appropriately went to the Library to find some good summer reads.  To my pleasent suprise there were two new Sarah Dressen books.  Now, I have read a few of her books.  They are really good summer reads; the kind that you just melt into and it takes you into these sureal worlds. About teens and their lives and whatnot.  They don't always end happily mind you but they are still really good.  So this one that i just practically tore apart in like a day was called ""Someone Like You.""  As I read it I realized that it was just like the movie ""How To Deal"" with Mandy Moore.  So in lou of me finishing the book tonight, I watched the movie.  I did like the book better, but the movie was alright too (although I had already seen it, i realized stuff from the book that make everything clearer).

Simon always says the Theme of a book is the most important part.  I think Sarah's Themes are always what draws me in.  They are just so identifiable, probably to every teen.  I mean the whole Matt episode could be compared to this book, in ways.  I guess its just like you live these experiances with the characters, which gets you thinking about your own.
So much junk has been going on lately.  With all the things me and the gang have been doing, i have been noticing more and more the... how can i put this ""sexual tension"" between all the guys (minus the couples) and Lesley.   I guess I am very intuned to all of the goings on and whatnot of our group.  I have always been like that. Talkin to both sides getting the scoop and then analyzing things.  But this time, its kinda about me, cus I am jealous and mad and rejected all at the same time.  I mean serioulsy no one has really ever liked me at all, which makes my feelins of inadequacy around the chicks magnified.  They have had so many guys like them already!  the problem is they dont like any of them.  If it were me in their place I think I would be different, not bad or anything, but i would give some of the a chance.

As I have also said, I really want this summer to be exciting.  I have to have surgury on my finger again, which is not exciting.  I guess when i say exciting i mean a guy, and when i say guy i mean one that likes me...
But Where the hell am I gonna find that?  I mean they dont just pop out of the sand or anything.  Oh well.  I guess I can dream, and read fun summer books.....
All for now
Gotta fly (and watch peter pan)

"event","I am still Damn sick of every guy in the universe scamming on Lesley.  I know it isn't her fault, but its all theirs for being STUPID!  
We went to the flood victim memorial last night in the Grave Yard.  It was so fun.  Eli crept around and scared us all, we went for a pitch black walk in an Orchard, then we sat on the grave site for like 15 minutes just listening. It was scary but fun.  The bad thing was we all got like 20 ticks.  Katelyn had at least 15.  
Kate's dog got ran over yesterday too.  It really sucked.  Everyone was really sad.  Especially me becuase I just went through all that.  I talked to her and gave her a pic of my dog, so she could remember that they are in Chocolate Lab Heaven together. 
I can even believe that yesterday was the last day of school.  It seems so long ago already.  We played Volleyball after school, and then went up to the soccer field and had a cook out.  Then we came to my house, sat by the chiminia until it got dark and then we went to the Cemetary.
All in all it felt like 3 seperate days.  This year flew by! WOW.  I am just so excited and scared for the summer.  I hope something Bangarang happens...
Today me and Ross and Eli chilled.  I dont kno about Eli sometimes, he has huge mood swings, from fun to a total downer meanie.  I really dont know what to think about it.

Yeah All for now

"event","Wow.  I went to a bonfire with my crew tonight. It was really fun.  Bob Marley, weenies, and the beach...what more could you ask for right?
Well the couples were being all coupley which has made me depressed or sad or something along those lines.  I mean I know I am not a ""babe' or anything, but I would say I was kinda ""cute""  and I lost all that ""ugly' weight and turned out alright I think, I donno. It just makes me feel weird thats all, like unwanted or something.  And with my guys I guess they tell me I am too far close to them to ever be thinked of as like a girl or whatever, but that makes me feel bad and sometimes good.  It is weird. I mean they dont consider me a ""guy"" or like one of them, and they dont consider me a girl or one of ""them.""  What can I say I am stuck in the middle, a Rouge if you would call me that.  Its frusterating.


Eli was there, I meant to talk to him a bunch but with him its like you can never tell what he is thinking. Sometimes he is really cool, and other times he is really close minded and mean.  And I guess ever since our elementary school roping days I have always had a soft spot for him... or maybe there is no one eles to channel my ""romantic"" energy toward.
I was trying to ponder all of these things while gazing at the wonderous full moon, but my mom had to ruin my train of thought by sitting next to me and talkin on the phone.  So what can I say, I came up here to my room and thought I would share it all with you...
Sad Huh..
Yeah i kno..

But I really really want something exciting to happen this summer.  I want to have butterflys about stuff, and i want to sit and daydream about what could happen..
but sadly right now I dont even have a situation to daydream about..

Well that is pretty much it.  Nothing more to say.  I wish I actually did because I am feeling chatty, but I mean normal stuff is normal.

Oh, by the way:  I got a moped. Its baby bluish.  I kinda feel cool riding it, and kinda feel dumb...
I hvent really decided yet
I guess it is  a form of transportation so I can't complain.

Well I guess I am out

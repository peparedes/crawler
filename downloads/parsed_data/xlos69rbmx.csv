Boy: No

Girl: Do you like me?

Boy: Not really

Girl: Do you want me?

Boy: No

Girl: Would you cry if I left?

Boy: No

Girl: Would you live for me?

Boy: No

Girl: Would you do anything for me?

Boy: No way

Girl: What would you choose: your life..or me?

Boy: My life

The girl runs away in shock and pain and the boy runs after her and says...

The reason you never cross my mind is because you're always on my mind. The
reason why I don't like you is because I love you. The reason I don't want
you is because I need you. The reason I wouldn't cry if you left is because
I would die if you left. The reason I wouldn't live for you is because I
would die for you. The reason why I'm not willing to do you anything for you
is because I would do everything for you. The reason I chose my life is
because you ARE my life.

"event","this woman thinks she's a panther
and sometimes when we are making love
she'll snarl and spit
and her hair comes down
and she looks out from the strands
and shows me her fangs
but I kiss her anyhow and continue to love.
have you ever kissed panther?
have you ever seen a female panther enjoying 
the act of love?
you haven't loved friend, 
you with your little dyed blondes
you with your squirrels and chipmunks 
and elephants and sheep.
you ought to sleep with a panther
you'll never again want
squirrels, chipmunks, elephants, sheep, fox,
wolverines,
never anything but the female panther
the female panther walking across the room
the female panther walking across your soul;
all other love songs are lies
when that black smooth fur moves against you
and the sky falls down against your back
the femal panther is the dream arrived real
and there's no going back
or wanting to-
the fur is up againt you, the search is over
as your cock moves against the edge of Nirvana
and you are locked against the eyes of a panther."

"event","ever felt a flash of hate so hot you think you'd just fry up in an instant but then its gone.  yeah just had that.  and i know why.... 

i'm getting bitchy im getting stressed and i'm getting hard to deal with.  i hate this essay, i hate when other people have control over me, and i hate people reading my work.  correction.  i like when people read my work when i know its good. i hate when people read my work and its bad.  correction.  i hate when i feel that i did good on my work and before handing it to someone, knowing that they will have predetermined that it is a piece of shit.  

there. i said it.  no matter what I write it will not be good enough.  yes, i went online and looked up college essays, and they were fucking great.  i know my writing capacity and it is not up to par with these people.  i wish i was rich and could afford to send my essay into one of these essay editor people because i looked at their work and its brilliant.  God, give me any other topic to write about than myself and I can do it.  

fuck this i'm going to get it written tonight.  i just have to get angry and tired.  then watch my mighty pen fly.  fuck that i hate when i get all mock heroic."

"event","so, i think it's time for an entry.  first thought, i'm making a birthday card for paige, yet somehow i managed to glue all the hearts on upside down.  sooo ya change the pattern, and put some hearts in there right side up

noone will ever know.    you've got to wonder how many of the things we consider ""brilliance"" were really just mistakes that noone called themselves on.  oh well.  now to choose the shade of blue for the opposing hearts.  

i'll go for the guady purple because that reminds me of paige, no offense, but not standing out has never been one of paige's qualities.  and i love snow patrol.  really.  

lalal i wish harry would come on.  i miss him incredibly, but he's with matt somewhere having a blast, and i know the s/o takes backseat when friends are over but goddamn i miss your voice.  please call me tonight, please remind me you love me.    
not that i dont feel it, but i need to hear it of i dont know if i'll go to sleep tonight.  i'll probably wait by my cellphone until you call, or until i fall asleep in which case i'll put the phone right next to my ear and get into bed.  and wait.    i know i know i'm being sappy but oh well.  those of you in love must know what im talking about.

moving on today i went out with ms. kenna to get halloween costumes at savers.  i got a blue skirt to cut really short, and a red top, red arm things (whicked hot), and a whip.  now i've just got to find white spiked heel boots.  and a tiara. and cuffs.  and white stars for the skirt. and material for the cape.  and a golden eagle for my chest.  and red earrings.   damn ive got a lot to get. oh well.  

yay you just called.  and you'll call me later if you remember.    now i've got to get back to making my card...
after im done writing.

so i dont know what to do with my myspace. i seem to have hit a wall with it.  i guess i'll have to redo the pictures, over haul it, leave a bunch of people comments.  lalal.   ive got a lot to do.  like rewrite english.

so i'm getting freaked out over college.  i'm going to start applying soon and having typed that my stomache just dropped into my bowels and i feel like im falling down a very deep hole.  but oh well i'll work as much as i can on my applications when i can, and try not to freak out.  little by little it shall be done.    i wonder what time it is. 

who should i ask for a college reccomendation.  i want to ask my principle but we we had a falling out of sorts last year.  i'm terrified to ask him but he'd be perfect. hopefully he's forgotten but i'm going to have to take that chance.  i need these reccomendations and one from an AP teacher who was a department head who became the school principle would write a great reccomendation for me.  if he agrees to hopefully.  

today i had to go into a sorority.  i thought they were going to eat me alive.  my mom was an alpha delta phi sister, and so i am a ""legacy"" which means i basically am resented by the sisters who had to pledge and do all the hard stuff, because i can just get in.  annnnd its just odd being around so many girls.  its terrifying.  so my mom decided to stop by her old sorority to talk to the house mother etc, so i left and sat out near the car.  fuck that, i'm not going near that place.  i used to feel okay in it when my mom was their director of finance and i was little.  now i'm big.  and my mom's not that anymore.  

gah the card looks like shit with these new hearts
new color.


madd nice, by the use of vibrant green, completely clashing with both colors, i unite them.  excellent.  

SOMEONE COME ONLINE AND TALK TO ME!!!!

its a good year for a murder.


god i'm wicked tired.  chris is online but i dont feel like talking to him.  he went off to college, i understand that, but still i'm pissed in a way.  we never talk anymore.  gr.   we have nothing to talk about anymore either.  someone come and inject me with sleep.  

i need sleep and a warm body in bed and about a good 72 hours straight. and for my boobs to stop itching.  that'd be great.

so i should really write my english thing huh?  the two things are due monday and i havent started.  i dont even think that my beginning idea was good enough.  oh well i'll take it and run with it. i'll brainstorm about it tonight so maybe my time up wont be a waste.   yawwwwwwwwwwwnnnnnnn

i think i'm going to go get paige's wrapping paper for her cd."

ANYWAY i'm here with my grandparents on my mom's side, and my entire family.  i slept on the floor last night. that was comfortable....     

went on a junkload of rides which were very, very exciting such as the Great Bear which i had a distinct feeling that it should be called Ursus, but maybe that's because it was the name of a rollercoaster i've gone on before.   Perhaps its because the great bear constellation in the sky is also named Ursus.  perhaps.  

so i'm missing a lot of people, namely the girls, harry, my puppies which i should call jordan and see how they're doing...  anyway ive been up since 7 and its 8:37, but i wish it was 10.  wanna know why?  because the zoo opens up then.  and they have lynx's and golden eagles, and black bears, and mountain lions, oh my.

"event","so, i'm pretty sure i just had one of the most frustrating, scary, and flattering hours of my life.  sooo i go to deposit my paycheck and who is at the bank but none other than every greasy skeezy state employee, and a bunch of other men. so i walk in with my vollyball top and lifeguard long pants on.  not that sexy right?  well apparantly so because i got 4 whistles in 2 minutes.  2 walking through the parking lot.  these men proceeded to stare hungrily at me, as i proceeded to have cramps and be grumpy as hell.  THEY WOULDNT STOP! dosent anyone have descency anymore? i wouldnt have a problem if they came up to me, introduced themselves, and actually talked.  

but no, i get treated like a walking piece of tail.  yippy.

so walking out, this older man walks by me and says ""smile hun, you're too pretty to not be smiling""   unfortuanly i was still peeved about the situation inside so i neglected to smile.  oh well. next time

so i get in my car and drive away.  i stop at the nearest cumberland farms to put $10 in my gas tank = 2.5 gallons.  kaldjhfkldajfkldajfkldjh;fdha;ofjakjkdajfldjfkl

anyway, as i'm coming out, these two guys, about 40 or so pull up in the sweetest pimped out cadillac i have ever seen in my life.  completely classy, all white interior, champaigne outside.  so pretty.  so one of them holds open the door for me to come out and say's ""well hey there cutie..""  i have no idea what to say.  so i didnt, i just smiled.  the guy kinda looked like he was going to follow me to my car, but didnt. i walked but then looked over at his friend in the front seat, who was watching me cross the filling stations in his rear view mirror.  the guy gets out of his car and starts to walk towards me.   k i'm not getting with a 40 year old, or even pretending that i would, so i beat it out of there.  he called after me ""bye bye pretty"".  

bleh.  each of these circumstances were flattering but in a creepy scary way, so i dont know what to think so i think i'll go take a shower.   thought you'd like to know."

"event","yo.. so my livejournal is dull and boring.  HOORAY.   on to happier things.

this weekend.  was crazy.  and drunk.  krunk.  crunk? 

Friday:  Skipped school with 17 other people (just in our group, b/c we met up with others) led everyone down to Narragansett which turned out to be CONNECTICUT because i am so good at directions.  then we got back to RI and ended up in CT once a friggan gain.

Made it to Narragansett, swam, chilled, then went to John's beach house in Matunic.     

Went back to Narragansett, then back to John's beach house.  Saw the ""spot"", walked a random beach, then went home. 

Hung at Kerri's with the ladies + Tom, then went home to rest up for a crazy night.

BUT.     

Then.   

I, me my little self and I, went into a liquor store and bought 5 40's all by my self.   I was so proud.  The girls did my makeup and clothes to make me look older and Tom had the cash.  Oh man.    Who walks in behind me?  My previously graduated nemisis Sarah J---- (kept in secret for she is a cunning foe and i'm sure she's googled her own name).  Muahahahahah little old me getting stuff.  So I ran outside and the girls swung by in my getaway car and i hopped in and it was nuts.  

Then to KERRI's!  where the party commenced.   Has anyone tried to down a 40 quickly?  I found it next to impossible.  So we got crunked (ive decided that's the spelling)  and went down to the bay to watch fire works.  which were awsome because i <3 BOOM.  

Then to Kerri's aunts house to say hi, and we pile into her appartment only to find Kerri's entire family there.  You know what Kerri's family does for a living?  They're all COPS.  EFFING COPS.  thank god they didnt realize how we were (auntie mary did but i love her and she was very discreet about it).  

Stumbling out again into the night, we meet Garrett and Jordan who come back to Casa Del Thomas.  There = more drinking and frivolities.  Heath follows me home, we wake up my dad but thankfully he's a very tired man after midnight and probably saw only blurry outlines of our bodies as we retired to the basement.  

Danzig movies when you are wasted, are incredible.  His jaw =   (_______)  this big.  so nuts.  we had to stop it and go upstairs and pass out in my room.  

waking up, i ... well.... i dont remember what happened until that night when mr harry came over.  which was bien.  mucho.  bien.  oh right i picked him up from volunteering.  so yes, we hung out, listned to some flogging, etc.  

NEXT  Paige's for paige mike casey and john, only john's random cousin showed up too.  we had a whole complicated scheme for the cars but it never happened.  what did happen was us racing 90mph to the drive in, them branching off and being almost late for the movie.  Madagascar with the group then me and Har watched STAR WARS because star wars rocks my socks.  and boots.    

so on the way home something terrible happened.  we missed the exit for warwick and so we got off at the next intersection in hopes of doubling back and getting to warwick.  no such luck.   we ended up in the middle of nowhere, on a road with no lights, no barriers, lines in the road, or houses.   barb wire fences and huge trees.  for miles.    then we see this slowly blinking red light in the distance.  we reach an intersection taht goes straight, left, or right.   and a red light, slowly blinking in the middle.  i'm telling you i was freaking out as was he.   locked doors, pocket knife.  did i mention my tank was almost on empty?  no signs of life anywhere.  i thought i had died and gone to hell.  we were thinking ""there has to be a town somewhere on this road, no road goes this long without an exit...""   well we failed to realize that PIKE means no exits.   we double back eventually and make it just in time to this random little gas station in nowhere.  TG harry had his debit card on him.  so then i took him home and made it home at 2:30.  bien.  

sunday was a cool down day, mostly hung with the fam.  and by fam i mean casey's fam b/c it was her brothers grad. party which was cool.  good food cool people, did i mention casey rocks at scrap booking?  yep.  

Sunday night rolls around and we end up at Tom's watching a video on greece because it is 11 WHOLE DAYS until i am in Greece with my 7 best friends.  look out Greece, the 7 deadly sins are comin for ya.

today.  was another school day.  ms. parente saddened me with how she brought everyone del's on friday (i skipped) and how she was so dissapointed in everyone (from the cutest little petite young blond mommy ever)  i felt like el crapo b/c she has been one of the best teachers ive had.  

this afternoon..... i drove 6 people home in my packed mommy wagon ( i love my wagon if i dont say it enough)   (i do)     and decided that it needed to be cleaned.  but first me and paige had some of her mom's awsome cookie pie that i must make.  i felt the fat melting onto my ass.  +1.2 lbs.    then we practiced CPR b/c of recertification, and i left and came home only to work on more math, clean the house, clean the dishes, clean the laundry, clean an ink stain on the upolstry, clean my car etc.  seth and alyssa to the pit, then watched Leno with mom and dad.  oh. god. do i love headlines.  they're the only part i care about.  

tomorrow.  i shall be sleeping in because i have gotten out of everyone but 1 of my tests, and then i shall probably clean up after alyssa and seth, clean my room, then head down to narragansett with ms baeszler to switch our lifeguarding bathingsuits.  maybe we'll have dinner down there, or afternoon lunch, w/e.  its summer, i care not.  

as interesting as that was for all of you, i'm done."

wow so i just looked back at what i had written and ""today"" was somewhat spelled like ""su tfr n""  but it was much funnier, and i deleted it and wrote today, but i'm wishing i hadnt. 

so its gorgeous out su tfr n.  i believe that i'll be taking books back to the library, going tanning, doing homework, doing laundry, and all that other good stuff.   on the upside my backyard does not look like a wasteland, but looks perfectly landscaped.  minus to that is WHERE IS MY FUCKING TREE YOU BASTARDS?!?!   

k now i have to go.

Put it down on a house
In a place we've never lived
in a place that exists
In the pages of scripts and
the songs that they sing
And all the beautiful things
That make you weep but
Don't have to make you weak

Cause I never loved somebody
The way I loved you."

just look at it.  dosent it look surprised?     


my friend just jumped off the empire state building!
wow!

next time someone tells you something online type wow    it will enrich your life.

also.  it is the same spelt forwards as it is backwards, which puts it in with racecar, pop, and peep.  how awsome.

another thing about the word wow.  it can be spelled out very easily by your very own body!   just write a W on both cheeks.....    and i will stop there because it works with both kinds of cheeks.   or so i hear.

flipped upside down, the word wow is also mom.  and i am mad at my mom.  which takes a few points from wow.  but oh well.  fin."

"event","the Jehovah's witnesses came to my house today, hoorah!!!!!!

only i was not there.    
first pamphlet:  Would You Like to Know More About the Bible.  
answer: resounding NO

second pamphlet:  What Would You Like to Ask God?
answer:  nothing

my favorite exerpts:

From the astounding knowledge of pamphlet 1.
""Knowing the truth about wicked angels alerts us to the dangers of spiritism and helps us to understand why there is so much trouble on earth.""
""Not only do these prophecies describe the condition of the world today but they also show that God will soon transform the earth into a paradise""

LMFAO k im writing as i read, and i just came across this.  these people are throwing in citations to make it look all spiritual.   look at this

""You do not have to pay for such a Bible study. (Matthew 10:8) It is offered free of charge...""   yeah.  Matthew commented on your payment methods.

woah. okay just read the title of the second packet.   ""THE WATCHTOWER: ANNOUNCING JEHOVAH'S KINGDOM"".
well glory be.

best bullshit story every.

""In Sri Lanka, a family regularly read the Bible togeather, but they werer not getting answers to many questions that were important to them.  Although they needed help, their priest could not provide it.  However, Jehovah's Witnesses gave the family satisfying answers to their  Bible questions, they agreed to a Bible study.  what they learned in their studies interested them very much.""

awww how cute, the little family in Sri Lanka trick.  sneaky bastards.

aww now this one is mean.  ""Castro cam to appreciate that his mother had died, not because of injustice on the part of God, but because of inherited imperfection.""

awww poor castro!

""The Witnesses pointed to evidence from the Bible tha the world is influenced by Satan the Devil, its ruler, and that it reflects his spirit.""  riiiighhhhttt

awwww another horrible story. scene kids, cover your eyes.
""For instance, Matthew, a young man in Britain, had always felt a deep yearning to find the true God and the purpose of life.  His father died when Matthew was 17 years old.  Thereafter, Matthew obtained a university degree in music.  He then experinced a growin awareness of the futility of his materialistic way of life.  He left home to live in London, and there he became involved with drugs, the club scene, astrology, spiritism, and Zen Buddhism and other philosophies--all in a search for a satisfying way of life.  In desperation he cried out to God to help him find the truth.""

k you crazy fucks, what does obtaining a university degree have anything to do with materialism.  and i'd love to live in london and get involved in all that stuff.  sounds awsome.  

wow. now this one is awsome.  ""Help to the Christian brotherhood has been provided by the faithful and discreet slave class.""  what the fuck??? its in the middle of a paragraph about the philippines.  so odd.  

and to end of the most awsome packet ever:

""If a Christian hears voices, does that necessarily mean that he is under demon attack?""
think about that kids.  think."

"event","i'm going to lyric the shit out of this thing and get everything out.




and so tonight to celebrate i will poison myself.
another coughing, shaking fit in a bathroom that is spinning.
so i close the door and rest my head on the tile floor,
sickness and sleep turning me cold.
i am still not sure, is there some better place i could be heading towards?
where the selfishly sick and self absorbed are welcome.
i saw the future once.
i was drunk in a phone booth.
my eyes were wet and red but i could not tell what was said
and through the screams of the traffic voices carried saying
i am sorry
on a day so gray its black inside
watching churches on tv
in a coma you don't dream you just hope that someone sits with you
babies turn blue when they are ignored like the sky on summer days
before you turn and walk away it has changed you
so tonight to compensate i will poison myself
another coughing, shaking fit in a bathroom that is spinning.







and nothing since has felt as radiant or real
and there is nothing more i want than just one night
that's free of doubt and sadness
one night that i can really feel



and i went to san diego
the birthplace of the summer
and watched the ocean dance under the moon
and there was a girl i knew there, one more potential lover
i guess that something's got to happen soon
because i know i can't keep living in this dead or dying dream
and as i watched along the beach and drank with her
i thought about my true love, the one i really need
with eyes that burn so bright, they make me pure
they make me pure
they make me pure



and that is it because i'm tired of looking up lyrics."

"event","I am the Rake

A woman never quite feels desired and appreciated enough. She wants attention, but a man is too often distracted and unresponsive. The Rake is a great female fantasy-figure - when she desires a man, brief though that moment may be, she will go to the ends of the earth for him. She may be disloyal, dishonest and amoral, but that only adds to her appeal. Stir a woman's repressed longings by adapting the Rake's mix of danger and pleasure. The Rake burns with a desire that enflames the man she is seducing. It is extreme, uncontrollable and dangerous. The Rake may end in hell, but the flames surrounding her often make her seem that much more desirable to men.

What Type of Seducer are You?

i want to watch my new Romeo and Juliette pretty badly.   but i'm not going to because ive decided to kick my butt back into action and actually focus on what needs to get done at the current moment, and not put it off for pleasure like ive done lately, the hedonist i am.  i know this entry is a perfect counter example but bear with me.  i wanted to write about something important tonight.

i'm sick of carrying around inner sadness and i'd like to be rid of it.  simple statement.  and now that ive said it it looks so much more simple than it feels.    i'm sick of smiling with sad eyes.  i'm sure my face would like to match every so often...

how about you come over and lift this lead from my heart







I'm broken down and hungry for your love,
Where are you tonight? you know how much I need it
Too young to hold on and too old to break free and run

Oh lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late

Lonely is the room, the bed is made, the open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one who dreams he had you with him
My body turns and yearns for a sleep that won't ever come

Oh lover, you should have come over..."

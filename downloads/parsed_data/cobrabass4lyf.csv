That's what I should've done in the first place, back in 2006 when I first heard about it. Had I not put off applying to the Walt Disney World college for so long I would've been able to go for the spring of 2009, or earlier!! Unfortunately, I was too late for a good role in the spring '09 term, and the only ""roles"" (job openings) available for the spring program when I tried to apply were Custodial and Housekeeping. So, I decided to wait until the fall. Even though the economy is really bad right now, I find it in my best interest to not go, cause I didn't want to be stuck cleaning up after everyone. It's really a catch 22 but whatever, happier days are ahead.
Well thats all for now. Catch me on AIM or iChat or w/e thing you use that is associated with AOL at lowdownbass4lyf and on youtube at youtube.com/5jo1ey5 where I vlog about disney stuff. Add me and we will have fun times!

Until next time,
Joey!"

I haven't given it much time to look around and see the new landscape of this realm but it looks to be pretty interesting. 

I want to keep this brief cause I want to have more time to explore.

Its great to be back friends. I look forward to hearing what you all have to say. 

Till next,
Joey."

"event","Hey all you musicians out there!
Im a drummer, desperatly looking for a guitarist, bass and keys. If you play any other instrument besides the ones above reply as well. Im not looking for that heavy ass metal shit that makes your ears bleed. Call me old fashioned but its disturbing lol
What Im looking for is a smooth jazz/funk feel with a little bit of real jazz. So if you dont have anything to do this summer let me kno and reply 

Thanks, 
Joey 

P.S Keep the music alive!"

Summer is here. Time to sleep, go out, work, school :-( and so much more. Lets reflect on how fast this; my junior year flew by.
It was one of those ones to remember. All the football and basketball games homecomming, junior formal, those days that u really dont want to get out of bed.Oh wait, thats everyday! LOL Indeed I had a blast. My teachers were str8 this year, compared to the pricks of the past. There were some emotional ups and downs, break-ups and hook-ups. New looks on old faces and apearences as well; one being The chorus' director, Mrs D. I guess she figured that there was no more hormones left, since o3 and o4 left. I think we all remember the first day! The football games were fun as well as the basketball games, eventhough the Cobras got robbed in the finals this year! There was soo much more that went on in school. the hard work that students put forth to get the job done. The commrodery that was felt. Eventhough there was some friction between some people it ended O.K. Although this year was bumpy people stuck with it and ""just kept swimming"" 
What to look forward to for next year? Fun new stuff. class of 06, WERE ALMOST THERE!!! Keep swimming!!! LOL
To the C/O 2k5 good luck with whatevers in store for your individual futures. Go to college succeed in it! get a job, get that green and live life to the o5 fullest.
To THE SENIOR CLASS OF 2.0.0.6 LETS LET THIS YEAR BE THE MOST UNFORGETABLE, MOST MEMORABLE, MOST ENERGETIC, MOST SCHOOL SPIRITED, MOST FUN FILLED YEAR SOUTH MIAMI SENIOR HIGH HAS EVER HAD AND WILL NEVER FORGET.
we've come this far, this make it happen!
I LOVE U ALL seniors seniors seniors seniors seniors etc. . ."

How can I start this Livejournal off with a bang so that i can keep you reading for ever? If you have the answer, let me know.
As many of you already know Im legal now as of the 15th of May. Thank you to all who wished me a happy birthday, indeed it was just that. Nothing really has changed, at least not as of yet. What do I think will happen this year? well hopefully i can stay out of trouble pass to 12th grade and focus on music/singing. I havent shown my fullest potential to my music teacher Mrs D. Ive only shown half ass. In the real world (aka the adult world where u have stuff to do and stuff to get done asap) half ass dosn't get you anything. 
The South Miami Music Banquet was saturday night. First and foremost ALL of the ladies that attended this evening were dressed to not only impress but to stand out. EVREY single one of you stood out in ur own way. I along with many of my friends enjoyed the night. Everything was good, decorations, DJ, Food, Drinks that kept comming.  I was tho ""let down"" by the fact that chorus nor band got to show their video yearbooks. It was nobodys fault, just the fault of technology, what happend was the bulb blew out as soon as it was turned on. Other than that, the night was really nice. I guess you could say I broke out of my shell a bit. Yea thats right I was dancin, and eventhough it may have looked ugly and like wtf is he doing, i didnt care. I enjoyed myself with whoever I was dancin with. . . HAHA no PDA? lmao with that said there was still PDA. I dont need to go into much further detail abou what went down you had to be there. I'd like to say congrats to all my fellow musicians who were recognized by there hard work and dedication, u know who u are. 
Now that this year is winding down to summer I have no plans for summer and have no clue what to do. I might take some classes online to get completly caught up but other than that im free. WOW 04 05 went quick as hell next year and accouple of days i WILL no doubt be in tears. I think the last week of school should be called tear week, its too sad. wow that was unusually tacky and very pansy-esc. Out of all the schools i went to, this is by far the best ones. I hope everyone has a good year next year and a kick ass summer this year! SENIORS '06!"

2. I will respond by asking you five questions. I get to pick the questions.
3. You will update your LJ with the answers to the questions.
4. You will include this explanation and an offer to interview someone else in the same post.
5. When others comment asking to be interviewed, you will ask them five questions

Responses to Danny
1. You get to meet one Beatle, living or dead, who is it? 
Interesting question Danny. Im not sure which one if any are still actually living. Ringo is on life support. George and John are 6 feet under. Who the hell knows where Paul is. His double is off touring around the world. I would have to say Paul.

2. You like being tall?
It has its ups and downs! lol. With all humor aside its not bad, it gets a good view at concerts, and some see me 

3. You can only play one sport for the rest or you life, which is it?
Do you even have to ask; its Syncranised Swimming.........  

4. Ok you are an Alien and you just got to Earth, what do you do first?
I would already have artificial powers and knowledge from another relm or plannet. So with those powers and knowledge of how Earth/Earthlings work I would fit right in and try to conquer the world Hitler style!

5. Kill someone.

*-This lengthy post is for Meli-* 

Today was f*in insane, it was a dress rehersal. which means that it was basically an eat shit day at a church. Before I get into the past few days Id like to take you back accouple weeks. . .ok, maybe only one with some change. Lets begin with the chorus trip that was fucking awesome. From start to finish, that shit was ganster. I get to school (no biggie) as soon as i blinked we were on the bus headed to Orlando. As usual the bus ride was a blast. I didnt sleep, but then of course who the hell did? Yea there was a few people here and there that actually were sleeping but nothing major. ANYWAYS! We got to Orlando and it was drizziling. So my basketball people were like FAAK BRO! lol (ok, not really like that but close enough) so we ended up playing anyways, I mean come on its just a little H2o So then the next day, everyone gets up early, eats and get ready to sing their hearts out. LOL 
The results sucked, they werent what we expected but what can we do. It dosnt matter whats on paper. Its what the individual thinks about in themselves! 
Concert Chorus overall rating-Excellent (2 e's, 1 s)
Womens Chorus  ""           ""     -Superior (congrats ladies)
Jazz - The usual superior
Madrigal - Superior
BBBS - Excellent
GBBS - Superior
Solos, well if u didnt have the anal judge that I had. you more than likely got a supeior. W/E im not gonna get into that. Its in the past. 
So on the bus ride back to Orlando from Lakeland. The energy was down and EVERYONE was tired. I personally was physically drained and emotionally drained.
It sucked I felt like i got robbed. For the people that were with me, Im being truthful when I say that guy was an anal asshole!!
So when we get pretty close to the hotel we pass by golden coral. Now if u havent heard, had or seen a golden coral. Ur missing out!
Let me tell you, thats good ass cookin. Now we brought a group of about 90 to that place. . . . . I'll leave the rest up to ur imagination.
Yup thats right we shut that shit down!!!! So then I went to sleep at like 4am woke up at 7:30am had breakfast and then packed all my shit on the bus to leave to island of adventure! 

(For those of u who are dear to me, bare with and the people who arent really.) 
That day in island of adventure was filled with internal human substances. . . yea thats right, u guessed it.
The first ride I rode was the HULK. Now let me tell you that shit was fucking insane!! twist an turns and loops and whirls. Yea, pretty good was to loose yourself. Luckly I held it in until I was in the line at pop-eye, argh. damn pirates. All i have to say is that it looked like orange juice ;-) YEAHYUH!!!!!!!
BRO Popeye is the fuckin ride to get on when its about 9 jillion degrees outside!. . . That shit was freezing. But I liked it. Then after popeye we ate lunch. I had a double bacon cheesburger with fries and a coke. GOOD STUFF right?. . . . . . .WRONG!!!!!!!!!. . . . . . (ill get to that in a bit) So everyone (all 40 of us) finished lunch and decided to go on jurasic park. I was being the biggest pansy of life. shitting bricks  cause I thought it was steeper than what it really was. So i ride it and well I come out ( well my elbow came out) on the picture. My tall goofy ass was bent down. 
After Jurrasic Park. All of us head over to dooling dragons. I was the slow poke because i didnt really want to ride it but they insisted, mind u i just finished consuming a HUGE ASS BURGER!! I was about ""let lose"" anytime! So we wait in line FOREVER AND A DAY!!!!!!!!! finally we get to the roller coaster. Pardo, the chaperon FORCED me to go on the coaster, in the front row. yea when all said and done. first row isnt that bad, but when ur on a full stomach. I wish i wasnt forced to ride it at all. So Pardo rode with me until we got to the front of the coaster but his seat latch wouldnt click so im here sitting saying to myself oh great how nice Im on this thing by myself. I ended up ridding alone and releasing some of the lunch that i consumed earlier in the day!
I get off the ride and its all over me, im like HOLY FUCK!! how embarasing. w/e i fought through it and people seemed chill with it. AS SOON AS I CHANGED! lol
SO that was basically my day in Island of adventure.
This week was fucking awesome, not only was it a week from my bday but it was also south miamis chorus concert. that shit was tiiiiight son
practice practice practice, thats all we did, and in the end it payed off 
Another reason why this week was bad ass, because right before the trip my parents surprised me with 2 Heat playoff tickets. It was alot of fun. and I enjoyed spending time with my dad. The only thing that sucked was that he had to go cause my mom was feeling dizzy and weak and ""out of it"" so he left and i stayed behind. I now regret it cause what would have happend if it was worse and i was still down town? Thank God everythin was alright.
The Heat ended up winning giving me a good early birthday present. LoL thanks pop!
My mom went into DR's hospital wednesday and is still there!. . . .I ask all of u a favor and pray for my mom! Keep her in ur thoughts!
Thanks
So guys in 22 hours I'll be turning 18. . .i feel so old!! ahh its good stuff. So this concert that was tonight went really good. im proud of all the groups we ""blew the house down"" To all the seniors that are leaving this year, I will never forget u. whether its 2 years later or 200 years later there a special place in my heart for all of u. I will remember u when you are gone! 
WHAT A CRAZY ASS ""after party"" lol a good chunk of jazz went to denys and me ana marsee gina and the rythym section went all the way out to Chilies on 87th. the bill was about 200$ good stuff. Got home about 1:20ish i feel bad cause im usually home by 12 but w.e im an adult now i can make my own decisions, right?
well my fingures are starting to cramp and well im tired as balls too, i plan to sleep my little white ass off tomorrow morning. GOOD NIGHT AND GOD BLESS!!!!!"

Well what can I say, other than May is going to be a crazy ass month. Not only is the NBA playoffs in its peak in May. And the Chorus trip that will be May 5th thru May 7 (crazy shit) Yea I'll start making my list the day before, Oh the cram!!! Now I know Im not the only one who is going to be up packing and doing laundry at midnight hours, yea thats right im talking to all those procrastinators out there. Dont worry its good stuff. Its actually exciting cause ur rushed to get stuff done. I have to bring sooo much stuff. Im bringing two balls, well ok four balls A volleyball and a basketball. Yea this is gona kick ass. Im looking foward to getting my ass spanked in Air Hockey (Meli) but whoooping ass in Volleyball, God I love being tall!! hahahahahaha!!! Yea and thats where basketball comes in!!! LOL Marsee, ur mine!!! Silvano, u too buddy!!! lol as for Tyrail and Jonathon, BRING IT!!! LOL i mean that all in good fun. 
Another thing that is going down in May are the NBA playoffs where the Miami Heat are doing GREAT!!!! in lol. I sooo want playoffs tickets, i dont care if im in the sky to watch the game as long as im there. Heat all the way baby!!!! After the trip we have a week till our concert yea good stuff I love that day because its basically to eat shit and sing and well eat more shit. I like it cause im with some of the closest and coolest people i know. LOL gosh i sound like a dork.....................blatantly skips over the weekend of May 13th .......................lol then on may 20th is the banquet cant wait, hopefully my date can get out of work so she can come :-D......now i know some people are asking, o0o0o0o whos the girl? well my answer is.....you'll have to see at banquet. lol cant wait. lol shit school is almost over and well next year im a senior!! its amazing how fast it went. I never really considered how fast it went. I remember being in Mrs Chases class (freshman) year with her saying ""enjoy this time, join clubs, join activities and HAVE FUN, cause by the time u know it. Your out of here"" boy was she right. LOL shes such a kick ass teacher. Well I cant say I didnt love the past 3 years. They were great, but I want to try and top it off with NEXT YEAR!!!!.........
So let me tell you somthing. Somthing that made me feel kinda special inside. A few weeks ago my sister went on a trip to DC and well my grandparents sent her 50$ for her trip. I didnt really make anything of it. It was nice and all but was there any jealousy or anything comming from me? No, why? cause she needed money. So fast foward to this last thursday. I had just gotten in the door from school and one of my parents said ""Joey theres somthing in the mail for you"" and so I saw who it was from and it was from my grandparents. Now being that my birthday is just around the corner (May 15th) I thought I was an early Bday gift. It wasnt. It was 50$ just to show how much they love me. Now I know to some 50 is poket change, but to people like me shit, 50 can stretch a Loooooooooong way lol Then I really got to thinking and said wait a minute ""money cant/shouldnt buy love"".....I havent cashed it yet. I will eventually I dont know what ill do with it. If u have any suggestions comment and well if you have just anything to say about anything I would love to hear. even if you think its stupid, theres no such thing as stupid. WOW this is very long. I wasnt even compelled to write this much but then again I guess I was since I did. I know everytime I do this I always get one person whos always like MAN UR SO EMO! lol well really i dont give a damn lol
I LOVE YOU ALL God didnt make me big for nothing. He made me big with a big heart. yea i have my moments. but seriously, who dosnt?? It dosnt matter If I met you 10 years ago or 10 seconds ago. Theres a place for everyone in my heart. Love you guys keep rockin what ur rockin whatever it is!!!"

Hey Long time no talk. Ive been really busy with stuff. Stuff like Basketball, After school rehersals, after school auditions, and ummm after school life(sitting around waiting for a ride) So lets begin. Today is a month till im 18. Last Monday was pretty normal. I mean come on its frickin Monday! I had basketball practice and I feel better. Its good that Im doing this to get my mind and my body positive. Tuesday were Jazz vocal auditions for next year, made it. I didnt go to Basketball that whole week, wednesday was Madrigal auditions for next year, made it. Thursday was some afterschool practice for somthing (its all a blur) Friday I didnt do anything but go to school and play dodge ball afterwards. Then you have the weekend...........cut the grass, that was about it. lol borring, yes i know. what can you do....SO once again another Monday rolls around and yep you guessed it. Just another Monday (practice). Tuesday (practice) not much different. Wednesday, I got to school early and my friends were like OMG WTF ARE YOU DOING HERE BEFORE 7:25?........ok ok ok, so i tweaked that story a little bit. I mean come on who is that energetic at 7am. But they did ask so i can say that. The reason for my early morning appearence was because my mother and my sister were on there way to washington for my sisters field trip to D.C so we had to wake up ass early (4 or 5) to go to M.I.A  to drop them off and me being the good son that am i woke up with them to bid them a farewell on there journey. LOL so we leave M.I.A. about 6. get home about 6:15 and were (my dad and i) like lets leave home at :45 so we did and yea the rest is History. I got the chance to actually get to school before the bell rang, kinda cool......if your a nerd! lol.....I had alot of fun last night. My Dad I went to the Miami Heat Road Rally at Mr Moes in the Grove and guys (and girls) if you havent been to a Road Rally and your as big a heat fan as I am. You need to get out to the next one. Its pretty much like a regular home game. Everyone was there. There was the beautifull Heat dancers. Only three were in costume (Jamie, Catalina, and Cassandra) but the rest showed up around the 3 or 4th quarter. Then you have 3 people from the Extreme Team there (Inferno, lil willie and gumbylock). They were break dancing with the Heat dancers. My boo Eli showed up (the one i got the pic with) ahh coolness. Then whats the party without Burnie and Michael Biamonte, for those people that dont know who MB is. He is the voice of The Miami Heat. Ill give you an example of what he says ""AAAAAND NOW, STAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND UP AND MAKE SOME NuhOOOOOOOOISE FOR YOUR MIAMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAT"" yeah, pretty excitng fellow if you ask me. For those of you who attend South Miami, he was there introducing the players at the winter pep rally. Also last night I was involved in a cake eating contest. The prize was an autographed weaties box signed by Shaq. I ended up loosing, but I was like ""its not worth it over a signed box of weaties"" I mean sure if it was somthing else signed then i would have been more into it. I didnt want it. So the guy that got it is going to put it on Ebay to get money. lol  Well its friday night and I have nothing to do. Tomorrow is when my mom and sister get back. I have a full day then the females are returning, ahhh the volume is going to raise X10 lol and on the note im out. good night and i will talk to you all later
Joey"

So Im doing this ""video scrap book"" thing for my chorus (the coolest class i have) lol. . . .im such a chorus nerd, but anyways. Im doing it and im having a blast doing it. its a pain, cause i have to edit the music, crop the pic, put in effects and pick good music that everyone will be into the night it is shown (banquet) but its kind of the equivalent of doing an actual scrap book.and its cool cause its done on a computer,after its done i put it onto dvd cd and present to all my people!!! lol
Ive come to a point where i have WAY too many pics of one group, i need to open it up. People werent complaining to me last year, but i felt bad anyways cause i knew i didnt put everyone. so i guess this year, i wanna make it the peoples scrap book if u know what i mean lol. . . . im almost done (with the first section) lol i had it at a minute and 30 or 40 seconds, but thanks to my inovative ways of editing a song that was normally 3 minutes im able to get it down to less than a minute, ill keep you posted on the process of the video, i actually wanna put video in the video, it defeats the purpose of calling it a video without any of it. ill take some on the trip and that basketball game that is gonna go down!! lol Diaz is gonna kick ass!!! lol
well the count down is getting smaller, 1 month and 5 days till im 18, i wanna throw a retro party somewhere, i say somewhere cause my house isnt a ""party"" house lol
well thats it for now ill be sure to post later, tty all later, peace luv"

WOW! Its been awhile since ive updated. I mean actually updated, not those ""quizes"" and poetry/lyrics. Ive been really ""busy"" i guess u can say
Ive been staying after school for accouple weeks, getting in shape and getting back into playing the game of basketball. At first i was a bit ragid and a bit soar. but after a few times going out there (to the basketball court) Ive regain some of my talent. Someother reasons for playing again is 1st, Im practicing for the Diaz vs Castro Showdown, sometime in may. 2nd  Im practicing for conditioning for next years Varsity Basketball team. I know for a fact if i start conditioning now I will be in shape for when the season rolls around in the winter of next year! It should be a great experience for me, and im looking forward to having a great season.....Lets see what else has been going on, umm well Im starting to feel really different. Im almost 18, just over a month to go, and at the rate everything is going. A month is as close as tomorrow. Its going fast! It just seems like yesturday I was playing in the front yard in diapers (weve all done it, you feel free) and watching Nija Turtles. Well at least there are still nija turtles, despite that its not the orginal but anyways. Can we have like a dedicated holiday to just throw it back, and be retro for one day, just ONE DAY!! We could call it ""retro day"". I mean come on, just about everything has a holiday now a days. Why cant we go back in time (but not through a time machine) like to the time we were kids and had no worries, except the occasional fright of the boogie man in the closet and the aligator under the bed. As you can probably infer, im shitting bricks about turning 18. I guess in retrospect, Im finally free. Im like the Geinie at the end of Aladin, where he gets the gold bracelets off, and is off to see the world. Now Im no genie but I sure as hell feel free. Not to
toot my horn, but my parents raised a fine young boy. into a young man. I love them. Eventhough we have our disagreements at times, every agrument/fight builds and bonds us stronger together. I have been sculpted and am ready to be displayed to the world. Im not sure as to what I will do on my BDay. I wanna do so much but time and money are an issue. Hopefully theres a Heat game if so IM SOO THERE! If not I would love to spend it with my friends and some fam. all of this is still a long ways away. 43 days to be exact. well i think that wraps it up, my life in a nutshell.

P.s To the people ive met this year and the people that i have known 
I love you all with all my heart, I pray at night for each and everyone of you. 
I thank him for giving me the opp. to be with great people (my friends) I love you guys!"

Im caught, stuck with a fork in the road.
should i go right. should i go left. 
Should i back up and go another way?
The decision of which way to go is eating 
the inside of my bowels. What should i do?

Run and dont look back, forget about the 
whole thing? Thats not me, I face my problems
face to face. But why cant there be a middle 
road. Why is it just trees? I guess for pit stops
As I look down each road thoroughly

In the forseeable distance I find both roads 
the same. Filled with beautifull carnations
as if the miserable season of cold heartedness
has passed and now they have bloomed into 
somthing i can decide.

How can i decide what route to take if i 
can't even find a bus, that will take me on the 
road i want to be on? Their both beautifull roads 
of spring I wouldnt want to walk through the beautifull 
roses of one road and then change my mind. (that would hurt the roses)"

I had to walk, but I managed to get to 
the desert. As Im there, out in the middle of 
nowhere I find but nothing itself. I see pictures of the 
city like pictures from a postcard from where I was before. 

Attempting to go after them I could never 
catch up with them. Eagerly chasing the 
objects, i soon relize their nothing but mirages.
Its high noon my mouth is a waterless pool
a pool that is waterless but is filled with love

Wondering if i will ever get to my destination,
wondering when it will come, i give up and go 
inside where i find a jug of water, somthing so 
simplistic, I feel greatfull that i have. I think and 
re-think that the bus will come, when it comes"

Today was evaluation, at Miami Dade North campus. South Miami Attended and brought two groups with us. Concert, and Womens Chorus. 
The engergy has kinda been low and people were not putting forth there maximum effort. Luckily that all changed today! LOL So we get to MDC and we go right on stage, to practice/warm up. then it was sleeping time (for me and accouple other people) cause it was time to sit and watch other groups perform and get excellents haha bunch of loosers! LOL (J/K best of luck to them in the future) Further more, mrs D our director gave us the signal. By the time i knew it I was warming up in a practice room. She told us ""NOT To PUSH, that the sound is magnefied x2 as soon as u get off the stage"" So everyone in the chorus took it into consideration, bla bla bla. We were on stage and EVERYTHING was good and gravy. As we were walking off the stage Mrs D get a thumbs and an ""exquisit"" for a judge. I guess cause were sooooo fucking gangster. HA but thats not it, the ganster-ness continues, or at least for the basses. When we got into the sight singing room, we sat down and got ready to read! lol so we do the rythym portion fine couple flaws but still good. THEN this is what made my day, the judicator (the one who wrote the book for sight reading) told us to open the books to the sight reading page and so mrs d went through her normal sight reading procedure basses had no chromatics but still had a difficult part. And for the musicians, basses ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS start on do and end on do, but this time, we started on do and ended on a mi. So we went through the song and at the end, The judge that wrote the book told the basses to raise there hands. We were like OH SHIT WHAT DID WE FUCK UP ON!?!?!?! we started shitting in our pants lol but he was like I want to congradulate/comend you on landing on the right note/syllable instead of being like the rest of the schools that sing a do (what a bunch of idiots, just read it!!!) lol so that was over and we all took pictures, and we were waiting for the results, so of course people were still tense, eagarly awaiting for the results. Mrs D finally shows up onto the bus and was smilling, but it was that fake smile that she somtimes has. NO this one was a deep smile kinda know that she is a bad ass with bad ass kids (BASSES)  so right there i knew it all good. But being herself, she simply whipe the smile right off and had this str8 face, and she was like, ""you know what?"". . . silence . .   ""were going to lakeland"". . . . . the bus just erupted in cheers, especially those high ass loud sopranos! lol.. . . . after the bus subsided she continued her sentence and said that we got straight A across the board. SUPERIORS BIZATCHES!!!!! YEAH! BIG PROPS TO THE BASS SECTION!!! (all 7 of us) LOL what a way to get recognition way to go CONCERT CHORUS AND MY LADIES IN WOMENS CHORUS. . . . LETS KEEP IN GANGSTAR IN LAKELAND AND BRING HOME SOME TROPHIES!!!!!!!!! WOOOOOO HOOOOOOOOOO, well ima go eat im famished so ill holla at ya fuckers later! PEACE. . . Keep the bass bumpin in ur life!"

Lets start this off by saying im officially black now! How you ask? Good question, I took the public bus on saturday for the first time ever! to Miami Highschool to get basketball tickets for the game that was gonna be played that night, it was the South Miami cobras vs the Miami high stingerys! Well let me rewind and tell you how i got to this bus situation. My weekend kicked off by me waking up, walking out of my room and asking my mother if there was any yard work (bitch work) to be done around the house! What do u think her answer was? lets just put it like this. I was out in the yard for two hours, chopping and chopping and making the sun shine through in my back yard for two hours (i got $15 for it, ok i guess...money is money) When I was done, i came inside and cooled off, by that time it was time to go to Jorges house (he was gona take me to the game) so i took a Hot steamy shower....wait! u guys dont want to hear that do u? (if so please call! LMAO J/k!!) so i got ready and my dad took me to his house. As soon as i got there we hopped right onto the bus and that is when I became black! LMAO. It was pretty cool, everyone is ""friendly"" and talkative its funny cause there was a drunk and he was loud as FUK. so anyways, we get to miami high and we walk up to the front of the school and people were there but they didnt teach there they were there for a teacher workshop, so we walked around frantically searching for tickets NOTHING!!! Meanwhile me and Jorge are screaming at the top of out lungs, ""wher the fuck are the tickets!!!"" so we went back to the front of the school and the people were still there, so we went around the other side and sure enough the ticket line was starting, people were there since like 3:30 (tix went on sail at 4) talk about some dedicated HIGHSCHOOL fans! lol so we got the tix and hopped back onto the bus (BLACK POWER!) got off and went to his house, chilled delux came by and caught a ride with jorges pops. he brought us at 6...so we got there and it was pretty packed when i arrived, LUCKILY i saw a friend of mine (Sol Angel) sitting RIGHT behind the bench, so i sat infront of her closest to the bench, WOW i felt like part of the team!!!! coach bill handed me the drawing board and said ""hold on to it whenever i ask for it give it to me"" so yea i was like a coach in diguise the whole game it was fun! lol so the game went into over time and well they are going to states. All i can say to that is GOOD LUCK, So after the game delux is trying to find a ride home, thanks to gigi, ( i think thats who was in the car) gave him a ride to wherever he needed to go. as for me and jorge, we ate at BK right across the street from where the game was! Funny thing was Me and him along with accouple other people from south miami were there (including kyrsten, sam another girl and two guys)  and EVERYONE ELSE was a stingery. Can you say fish out of water?!?! I would! lol so we ate and like 2 hours later his mom picked us up and took me home! GOT DAMN! This is only saturday!!!! LMAO!!! 

SUNDAY
was pretty fun as well. I woke up light head as FUK! and went back to sleep until 10:30 when then i got out of bed ate speacial K cereal it tastes pretty good. I asked my momz if i could go to sunday on the mile since I knew a band that was performing. THE SOUTH MIAMI LATIN JAZZ QUINTET (from south miami senior high) I got there just in the nick of time to hear them play two songs? wtf, only 2 fucking songs?!?! luckily it was free and the weather was awesome! when the second song was starting Ana sees me and i see ana, then i see behind her is meli soo we were having a good time hearing our friends onstage. As soon as there done we see them and there happy to see a turn out like that, too bad they were playing on a side stage! NEXT YEAR UR PLAYING WITH THE BIG BOYS!!!! So the 3 of us ( me meli and ana) go walk around and walk and walk and walk and walk and walk... MAN MY FEET ARE KILLING ME!!!!!! we got free stuff, 2 bags and a mini flash light to make people feel like inspector gadget or somthing, when we were walking we saw this old guy with the same blue bag we just got for free on him, and we were like is it that tight? so meli being the brave hearted soul that she is, tries it on and we were like bummer dude, well maybe not in those EXACT WORDS but similar so yea! I dont know if Meli or Ana are gonna wear it tomorrow but i know im not, ill save it for the trip because it makes a perfect shoe bag, thanks to the people and GM motors i have a free mini inspector gadget flash light and and blue bag!!! pretty kick ass for just walking around lol soo after that we went over to hear Arturo Sandoval play, hes good it was a variety of music him and his band played awesome songs. they played a rif from spain which was bad ass i guess the only part i didnt really like is all the screaming he did i mean yea do it accouple of times but not EVERY messure ANYWAYS it was a good concert before the concert ended Meli and Ana dipped to Melis house i think, i dont know the full details on that but as for me, i called my pops to come and pick me up so he did and well thats about it, now im hear talking to u, yea thats right. you right there, reading every word wising it was the last word but its not cause it keeps on going and going, LMAO!!! this is great (sorry im easilly amused) Uve read this all  come on, whats a few more paragraphs, OH SHIT im tired well ill see u people when i do. right now, im gonna go!!! ""k bye"" lmao kick ass movie of the year  Napoleon DYNOMYTE
LATER, 
Meli and Ana I had fun today!!! thanx for giving me somthing to do!"

Time keeps on ticking, where is the bus?
Into the future, i feel like I can't even pay a cab, 
it just isnt the same as the one. The bus that
dosnt seem to come my way. It is pouring now
Where is the bus?

Are these tears of grey or are they drops of rain?
I feel they're a mixture of both.
The pain i get of other people getting rides and me?
stuck on the curb in the rain with grey tears
of pain.

The busses I see are either packed like sardines
with one, countless busses roll by, non seem to stop
Am I on the right street? or am i a block off? I ask for
directions but no one seeems to have an answer. 
days roll by, Im still on the curb waiting..."

On the corner of the curb I stand waiting for the bus.
Where the cars roll by, I stand waiting for the bus.
It is where i find myself day after day,
Still waiting for the bus. As i see pedestrians;
I see them get on and off busses.

And still my destination has been postponed,
because the one has not come, and therefore
i stand waiting for hours upon hours, days after days
As i stand waiting for the bus.
I see friends both young and old getting on and off difrent busses.
Bus after bus im still waiting for the one.

Trying my best to find the bus, i have difficulites as if i am a 
baseball player playing outfeild without a glove, I can not catch 
""the ball"". Im still on the corner waiting for the bus. Wondering if the 
bus to my destination will ever arrive, or will it be forever, till it make me
cry grey tears like that of the smoke twirling from the exhaust. waiting 
and waitng a life long wait for the one, my bus to come.

Im going crazy just thinking about her. someone I've know, but haven't seen since years ago.
Its funny how the world works. We met in an internet site. 
Funny thing is, i dropped a word to her on valentines day.
Hopefully when she read it, she didnt think it was too gay.
should a person be able to  express how they feel?
or should they just keep it on the real!
being quiet is not always best. Express yourself to get it off your chest
You'll never know until you try.
If you get hurt, dust it off and get back on the love horse and keep riding!
If you dont take chances, you'll never know what romance is. (hmmmm, i should take this advice)

*hopefully i dont fall off the ""love horse""  again."

It has hit me suddenly. That in just over 2 months I will be an adult. WHAT!!! Joey 18? I know, im saying the same thing!!! Its insane just thinking about it. Where did all those good times where i used to play cops and robbers outside or cowboys and indians worry free about everything. Its crazy how fast life is traveling. I somtimes agree that time goes by faster when you have more fun.::sighs:: wasnt it just yesturday where i was learning my ABC's and actually being told to go to sleep IN CLASS!!! instead of being forced to stay awake, how awesome was that? those were the days where you could pretty much get away with murder, but saddly enough those days are gone forever. Now its staying awake and procrastinating about hw and other things. The past 17 years of my life have been rather exciting. Who knows what the future has in store for me, or anyone for that matter. I guess i should eat more fortune cookies. The more i think about actually being an adult freaks the shit out of me. Stuff changes, it may take awhile but it still changes. One of the things that changes is your not looked at as a juvenile, so its not dentention. you can get locked up if you decide to do somthing stupid. Another thing that changes is actually having to pay for more stuff. shit aint handed to you, like it is when ur a kid/teen. You gotta earn everything u get. its a dog eat dog world. Medaforicaly speaking I wish i could play in the sandbox for ever. but unfortunatly we tend to get older and more wiser and learn from mistakes that prepare us for that dog eat dog world. Damn i was at dadeland the other day and all i kept thinking about is ""damn i gotta get a job"" cause at the time i had no money to buy shit!! so  i just window shopped yea it was fun cause at least i got a work out i must have looped that mall at least 5 times. BUT ANYWAYS!!! I guess all im trying to say in this entry is that well my bday is commin up in just over 2 months I will be turning the scary 18 AHH i dont want to be 18 but then again i do. well im still 17 and well i want to enjoy the remains of my childhood before. If u got any plans and want to go with a friend, hit me up!! Im not a kid for much longer!"

Rachael was upset...but we outnumbered her. we already skinned him, and today we were locating muscles in the chest and limbs. god i feel weird in skirts. oh! ariel had a little get togeather, and tian was finally able to come!! yay!! (almost never happens) and i had called her earlier and asked, ""would you mind kissing me?"" she said sure, so we were gonna do that at the perty. after we both had 1 and a half cans of red bull (which has no effect to me except groginess) we were like ""should we do it now?"" well, ariel's mum was there....so we decided t wait. waited to long....me and my bro left early, but today in school, i found out that the mom didn't care and was wondering why we didn't do anything perverse during the truth or dare game.........damn.....next time!lol! anyways, it was fun, and now that i can ""legally"" drive people, i can go up to her house on fridays, and maybe bring sydney and ariel with me. Driving gives you so much more liberty, just like high school, although, there are also more restrictions and shit like that. half the school(god knows more) drink, have sex, or get stoned. or any combo. i haven't gone anything THAT extreme....but i've visited the border on two.......(i didn't do anything!)

So today, rachael bought me lunch, but she owes me money anyway. I was thankful for her. A week or so ago, we were at my friend mikey's house, and we were sliding the ball's on the pool table back and forth. I took the cue ball, and slid it to the opposite side (where rachael was standing) and it hit the bumper, and shot up straight into her eye!! i freaked out, cause i thought i hit her dead on, but i only hit her on the bone above her eye. (where the frontalis bone is covered by the obicular oculi....i think.) the bruise is finall gone, but she keeps rubbing it in....boo.....hmmmm.....

Is it really that bad if you're bi? i mean, ya ain't gonna fuck them or marry the same sex...but you still get the urge to kiss them and hold them. ;p i'm reading too much manga and manwha....or am i?

He's too afraid to be hurt or faced with the reality of the matters. Pain is a risk we take with living! We cant learn or grow unless we overcome obstacles. I may seem a little too harsh, but damn! I was happywhen i saw him laughing with his friends on the street(although he did shout fuck a little to loud. i think my father heard.)but if this is how he acts....maybe....grrrr. Maybe my father was right(tho i hate to admit it) Maybe i should have an older boyfriend. Not now of course. God. Now would be the worst time. Noone deserves to be a rebound. Still, it's hard to accept all the truth and crap he said and be happy with it. I'll try to be a good person and try to accept....blarg. Until he's over me, or at least until things improve, it'll be like trying to walk towards forgiveness with shackles bound to my wrists and ankles. I don't want him to feel sorry for himself or me. I want him to get moving in life and go back to normal. but you can't have everything you think you need in life can you? No. No matter how hard you try or think. Everything is left to chance. The most important thing to do in life is laugh, learn and move forward. Love doesn't always prevail. Even when love is lost, you can still laugh. or cry and mope. Not that crying is bad, but it makes me feel bad. If jason feel like can't trust me, then maybe he doesn't deserve it. How did i breech his trust when i was only being honest? Am i really that cruel? Maybe i should become that way, so he can see what cruel is really like. Then he would realize how kind i was. No, i wont let myself become that.NO. He will only think what he wants. He'll have to be satisfied. I was sorry for causing him pain. Just because i never say i'm sorry, doesn't mean that i actually can't EVER be sorry in my life. I really was sorry but if he can't believe me, then who am i to judge? It he were to say he was sorry now, to my face, i know i would lash out at him. ""Sorry? For what? Do you feel so bad about yourself that you're apologizing for it? Just stop pitying youself and get over it!"" that's what i'd say, and then thingls would go down hill. I do care for Jason, it's just that i don't love him. Whenever he said it to me, my heart stopped. 'i don't love you' it would say. I realized how seroius he was, and how i wasn't on that level with him. You can't fall in love at 13. you're barely 2 years into puberty, and starting to mature. Hell. I'm 16 and i can't fall in love. That stuff doesn't happen until what? You're 20? Hell, find someone better. he should at least, maybe not, immediatly. I not, then ta hell with it! I can't control him, or how he thinks. or feels, or deals with shit. Each man takes life dofferently(and women). We can all find peace within ourselves.......

"event","Grrrr.....there is no way to express te way i feel right now. I've had some ""enlightenment"" on how my ex feels. Tho it was before i broke up with him. Still...maybe it'll clear some stuff. Some of the stuff was not true tho. Grraahhh!!! Other stuff was true, but still. It just seems alittle dog-headed. It's a joke huh??!! Did i let pride get in the way? YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW! I knew it would hurt Jason to brake up with him, but it's better than letting us live a lie! Just somewhere along the way i lost the connection i previously had with him. Under NO ONE'S fault. I tried to hide it at first, thinking i was just being silly, but when he held me in his arms, i realized that i didn't draw pleasure from it anymore. I didn't like him like that anymore. Is that wrong? I knew that letting him believe that we were happy was a lie, and wrong. I couldn't fool myself. I wasn't thinking only about myself. i was thinking about Jason too. He shouldn't live life under false pretenses! He doesn't deserve to be dating someone who can no longer return their feelings! Why would someone willingly live under those circumstances? I know that people do, and mayhap Jason is correct about my pride. My pride from doing things i think is wrong or dishonorable. Well i can't help it. My ideals are different from others. That's what makes me a human, and i know i can be immature, but how did that come into play? My friends and the ones i love come before anything else.why would i deliberatly harm someone i care?? I noe i'm inconsiderate. That's one of my flaws. But that's how i grew up. Jason hasn't talked to me in 2 weeks, and to sum it up with what i read, it makes me more bitter than i should be. Maybe not, but people should guess how i act and think a little now. With Jason, if 2 days later he would have siad, i need more time. i'm gonna be alone for now. I would have been jolly. but he hasn't done that. He's hidden from me, and as much as i hate myself for it, i see that as (slightly) cowardice. The longer he waits, the more bitter i become, and that may be trouble for us. I noe he's emotional and avoids the problem, while i eliminate it as fast as possible. But isn't that an excuse? we should come togeather and come to terms. Then he can drop out of my life if he wants. It probably wont work tho. he will never come to me, and i don't want tomake him come, but i'm losing patience. I thought maybe he would handle the situation better by now, but it seems i'm wrong. He's too afraid to be hurt or face with the reality of the matters. Pain is a risk we take in living! we can't learn or grow unless we overcome obstacles....i have to go now....but i'll continue later."

He barely said anythihng, and i could feel the bitterness and animosity behind the silence of the phone. It was strange. I want to rant right now, but my friend says i don't know his side of the story. I don't know why he's avoiding the problem, not speaking to me, how he feels, or how long it's going to take. I would have been much happier if he would have just come out and told me....but no.

I couldn't go on like that. i watched as it dawned on him, and i saw the sorrow in his face. i wanted to stab myself right there, beecause i never wanted to cause him that much pain. i don't like him like i used to, but i still care for him, just like all my friends. by the end, i was crying a little, and i never cry. he wasn't looking at me, and i was glad, for then he would have seen my face. i almost wished he had seen my face, so i could of said, ""Look how much it pains me!"" it was all for the best. at least that's what i tell myself. i can't go throught life doubting, and i can't go on lying to myself. maybe when were older things will change, but for now...

After school, i went to a friends house, and we spent about 2 or so hours at her house. We got a little bored, so we decided to ride our bikes to the library. We were goin through eagles nest when my friend Ariel said, ""Hey, i think this is the street John lives on.""
   ""Really?"" i asked.
she said yea so we went over to bug him. After letting him noe we were coming back, we went to the library and came back. I was hanging on a tree branch in frot of his window and started to bounce to see if he would notice me. he didn't and then i got a cramp in my foot. i fell to the floor, took my shoe off, then started chucking mulch at his window. He looked at me and started to laugh. i got up and ran into his door and then he opened his door for us. Once inside, i tried playing this online game. I really suck ass at the game. i didn't noe the config and got shot real quick. i was cussin too much so i got off and started playing with his kendo sword. got bored with that so we threw year old marshmellows at each other. hahahaha it was fun. After that, i started collecting bb's and got the 44 bb gun from John. i smiled and aimed at his head and shot. i hit him dead on!!!! i kept that up until he got a big comfoter to hide himself. i still shot him when he got up. Hehehehe, then he started to torche his bushes with a lighter and spray bottle, shot him then too. shot him till i decided to see if it hurt and shot myself......it does hurt. that was pretty much it, besides the fact that i took his bb gun and kept it. today, i'm gonna ride back with ariel, knock on his door, and shoot him when he opens it.

I was playing with my friends housekey on one of thoses necklace thingys, and i was acting like i could kick your ass. (Which i probably could) But i was messing around with brett, faking him, nearly hitting him, and proving i'm just faster and better than him. On one bout, he actually kneed me in hy hip, and i was so tempted to punch him across the face, but i resisted the urge. Then, as i was playing again, two freshman came and seperated us. Some kid named Matt Carol and some dude named Jarred. They stopped us and Jarred looked at me and said, ""So what are you? Black belt? Red belt?"" and he went on and on. I just gave him a why-are-you-bothering-me look. He looked at me and left real quick. Matt on the other had, was like, ""Can you do this stuff?"" he took his belt off and started to poorly imitate someone with numchucks. I said yea and showed him with the keychain i was messin with earlier. I kinda drew attention to myself. He asked me to bow for him so i did. He came back later and i kinda faked him out with some punches. He asked me to bow again and i did, with my fists to the side going into the korean ready-steady-go (Or horse stance) and waited for him. Brett asked why i didn't go into a cat stance. Feh! like a little caucasian boy could do anything to me! *Puffs out chest* Anyways, everyone was asking me to hit him so i said the next time he came. WEll, he came back and i walked up to him and did a weak right hook into the thickest part of his arm. He squealed in pain and came back with his belt. He taped me with his belt and went away. Everyone congradulated me and asked if i really would beat the shit outta him. I was smiling and went over to Brett, i shot out my left hand(weaker) and gave him a solerplex shot. He left me alone and i was happy the rest of the day!!!! ^.^"

Friday and monday was a good day, because i finally got to spend time with my b/f. he plays football, so i rarely see him.

"event","Yesterday was a fun day. At 1:20 i went to see AVP with my boyfriend, brother, and two other friends. It was a cool movie. Since it was a modern movie, they made the aliens and predators look very realistic. i was like, shit, it that were me, i'd be runnin like hell. everyone died except one lady, and that was because she joined sides with the pred. i think he only accepted her help because she had his gun, and she killed an alien. That made her worthy enough to live. In the end, the predator was killed, but the queen died first. Afterwards, the whole pred fleet ame down to claim the dead one. The leader gave Woods his staff, and the left. At the very end of the movie, an alien popped out of the pred's chest, so now there's gonna be a sequel. I was a little vague for those of you who have not seen the movie. All in all, i had a good time, except i saw my ex there. he's an asshole and i really didn't want to see him. i hate him i hate him i hate him!!! grrrrr....*sighs* oh well. it's over now. After the movies, we went back to a friends house and played pool. there was an arrow there, and my b/f said, ""Hey tyler. i'll pay you if you can throw the arrow through the cup."" it was a movie cup, and the arrow had to pierce through both sides. he threw it and totally missed. they were laughing at his poor aim, so i decided to try. i threw it and i hit the cup, but it bounced off. so, after a few more attempts, i finally chucked it and sent it through the whole cup. and of course, the boys were all like ""That was awesome."" they were laughing and i asked, ""Where's my money?"" in the end, i got a dollar, but the thrill of throwing an arrow through a cup was good enough. after wards, they challenged me to hit a lightbulb. i hit it faster than i did the big cup. i hit it and it shattered everywhere. we cleaned it up then i decided to go for the cup again. i got it on me 2nd try this time. after that, they told me to stop. they were afraid i was gettin to good and would start aiming for moving targets. i got another dollar for the lightbulb! ^.^ i should stop my meaningless rambling now."

"event","Well, not much is new...jus' thought i'd let you noe i'm not dead. I tried to do imperial conflict...but i got confused real quick. so..since i'm a kings of chaos age 2 veteran...i decided to back to that game. a lot easier to understand, and now with the new modificatons, it's more interesting. summer is almost gone and there are pro's and con's to that.
Pro's: get to see friends again.
       get free lunch( even if it does suck)
       don't have to be at home
       get to break rules and make fun of kids

the cons: homework
          grades
          nagging teachers and parents
          rules
          takes up the whole day
          waking up earlier and going to sleep earlier
that about sums it up. oh...forgot one more pro: get to brag about boyfriend!! ^.^"

"event","Well, coz's have been for almost a month. They leave on the 19th of july. God damn it's hot!! I hate bein outside now. Moe around too much for more than 5 min and you're melting! I feel sorry for my cuzs. They come from washington the state, and it ain't that hot over there. Tho' they have gotten better, manner wise. When we were all little, they were little annoying brats!! Better now. Oh yea!!! i now have a boyfriend i actually like. Been 2 weeks and i haven't dumped him yet. Or visa versa. I never liked it before, but now it's better. There are a lot of plus to this deal:
   1. you have someone to brag about.
   2. you have someone to protect you in case you piss someone off.
   3. you get treated better than before
   4. you now have someone else to spend money on, so people don't think you are greedy.
That's about all at this point. 
     Tales of Symphonia comes out tomorrow...AARRGGHHH!!!!!! I hate waiting!! i always wait for all kinds of shit! *mumble* I don't wanna wait....i hafta tho'....^.^ i'll be playing it all day tomorrow tho'!!! i got it reserved, so noone can take it from me!! MUAH-BWA-GWAH-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I was playing final fantasy XI online, and the people on that thing are nice!! I made a friend, Tsukisan, who was a female character, but it turns out that Tsukisan was a 17 year old mexican-american male who lives in texas. that was a little bit of a shock. i just assumed female mod, female person. And he's mexican. *shiver* some are nice, but the male mexicans i've met kinda stare in only certain...places...*cough* I guess my mind will forever be held in darkness... never knowing if a man is really a man, or visa versa....well there are some ways to find out! -.- hehehehe.... anyways...i get to go to parties as i mentioned before. one is tonight. Did you know that crashing into fences hurts, and that one may sustain injury?? Hmm....i should probably shut up now."

"event","Well, yesterday me and my bro got new haircuts. Tristan got a military buzz (sorta) and i got something totally new done to me. I usually just get cut shorter, nuthin special, but this day was different. I don't noe exactly what happened, but it took about 2 hours or so. I think i got it layered, angled then highlighted. That's kinda different for me. Sounds dunb, but it is....or was. Also, today was the closest i got to being a ballerina. *Cough* I was riding my bike and i stood on one foot on the center bar, then i extended my right foot out and and said look at me!!!!! The next second i fell over and landed with a loud thud and rolled for half a block. I got up and said, ""Dude that was cool!"" my friends laughed at me and my bro called me a dumbass. Feh. Later on in the day, he stuck his foot in the spoke of his front tire and flipped over the front of his bike. WHO'S THE DUMBASS NOW!!!!!!!!!! HUH!!!!???? shit. he's watchin me......i should probably go now....."

I just looked at him blakly and said, ""Really?"" hmmm, i think the same thing happened on my own birthday. The day before i was like, ""My birthday is tomorrow!"" then the next day someone said happy birthday and i was confused. After a moment i realized it was my birthday. Are girls sappose ta do this?? My brother seems to laugh at me every time i do this. He mocks me.""How old are you?"" he'll ask, and i actually hafta think about it. If the world is full of idiots like me, then our population is doomed. No chance in the world. Doomed. Well, we would have a lot of fun....nevermind."

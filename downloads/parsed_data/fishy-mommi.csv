"event","Ok, lately i have been thinking about doing something and i am really not sure about the idea. So what do you think?
I am thinking about writing a book....a book about my life, or more so about what i think about my life in general and all the lessons i have learned along the way. Now the reason i say i am unsure is because i am not sure it would be interesting...on the other hand it does have alot of DRAMA!

Just throwing a thought out;)"

"event","Last Night was Halloween, so Dad and I (for some strange unknown reason) decided to go down to Sixth Street for the Big Halloween Party....
Pretty Interesting. Lots and lots of weirdos, mexicans, white trash, new orleans refugees and just plain  weird college kids. We were really kind of disappointed at the lack of creativity in Austin of all places....We were down there for about 2 1/2 hours and only saw maybe a handful of creative original costumes. But there was absolutely no shortage of zombies, witches, pirates, and many variations of those oh so special ""landscapers"" LOL
But Oh Least I Forget.....The SLUTS! OMG.....i was in shock at the things these girls were wearing....i mean i have been known to show some skin (haha) but no way in hell would i walk down any street wearing the things they were....Stacy and John would have had a great time together *wink*
Ah but the best part of the night was knowing how many idiots in Austin will be wearing comfy houseshoes and bandaids for the next week...men and women...and all for the shoes!
Anyway, here's a pic or two..... BTW..The first pic of Marie Antoinette was completely made of ouf newspaper...both  of the costumes were...
Love You,
Momma

Is it is also sinister, cynical, and vaguely threatening to the purer folks of this world, and you probably get off on that. You would cut a greasy fart, then blame it on your mom, and then just shrug when someone pointed out that she's dead. <BR><BR>Yours is hands-down the most outrageous sense of humor; you like things trangressive and hardcore.

Do i really need to do it? I have to be up for work at 06:00 tomorrow and considering i didn't start work till 18:00 on Monday i think its pretty harsh.

Afterwards i felt like i wanted to die, and that was while i hadn't given it my full attention i dread to think what i would have felt like if i had. And Elisabeth Shue has cracking jubblies.

Totally rigged that just 2 have a picture of Napolean, but what are you gonna do... It's been a while since I've updated this.. Especially since I said I wasn't going 2 anymore. Hmmm. Soo.. Things are going pretty good. I miss my friends. I've been thinking about everybody lately. I just had spring break but didn't know if anybody else did or what.. If anybody wants 2 call it would be a good time 2 catch up.. If not, see you at the reunion.. Only like 9 years left right? Good times. Well, later. Cya <3ya

I'm so excited: GOOD CHARLOTTE!, New Found Glory, COHEED & CAMBRIA!!, Yellowcard, Story of the Year!, Sugarcult!, Taking Back Sunday, Flogging Molly, Silverstein, Billy Talent and Allister are all gonna be at Darien Lake! (plus more of course) :-D I am sooooo going! *Does happy dance* This makes me feel pretty good right now. Definately have 2 get a job now, if for no other reason.. Things have been pretty rough here lately. I guess all the times I've bitched about how bad things were I never really knew bad until now. The important thing is that we're getting through it. The biggest thing I've learned is that I don't need people 2 help me through things as much as I thought. Of course Drew's been there for me, but I've been doing just fine without the help of anybody else. My mom said that I've been acting like the parent lately.. I've been driving her and Jenny all over the place, and  taking care of her whenever she needs me. I might not be the strongest person in the world, but I've been holding a lot on my shoulders lately. Everythings been happening so quickly. Since that's the case it feels kind of like a dream.. but this is no dream. I'm gonna get going, everybody buy your Warped Tour tickets!! Cya <3ya

It felt weird walking through the halls again, just like I was a freshman or something. There's a new rule there about PDAs. I find it hilarious that they try 2 stop people from hugging or holding hands, thats going a bit far.. Good thing I don't have to worry about that anymore, not that I ever really needed 2 in high school anyways. Nothing else 2 exciting going on.

It's probably affecting him the most out of anybody. I love you babe, thanks for always sticking with me. :-* I went 2 see Spongebob with Jen & Jamie 2day~It was funny, kinda dumb but what do you really expect from a talking sponge? I'm in the middle of dishes and downloading.. Attempting 2 enjoy the time left at home. Hey did I mention that Jenny & I figured out that they're probably going 2 kick me out once the baby's ready for it's own bedroom? Where else would they put it? Ugh..

I miss songs like ""As I lay me down"" by Sophie B Hawkins, ""Hook"" by Blues Traveler, and ""The Impression"" by The Bosstones.. What ever happened to good music? Maybe I've changed but it seems like the whole music scene has changed too. I mean who really needs Ashlee Simpson and Lindsay Lohan lip-synching? I miss the good old days. Who knows? They might have thought the same thing in the 90s after 80s music changed.. (80s music=also good) Anyways, Drew's coming over in a bit.. Yay something 2 do. I can't wait 2 see Jen, Jamie and Jade this week. I'm actually seeing my friends now that vacation is half way over with. I don't know if I'll mind going back 2 school. I miss the freedom. I think its nicer 2 be bored there, and at least theres not some1 picking up the phone when I'm on it. I know I'll wish I'm home 1ce I'm there but still I kinda like being away sometimes too..

I'll just wait and see how this turns out like all my other problems (this is more of a situation maybe?) Hopefully it will work out for the best. Jenny is still upset about it, but I don't really expect much more since she's at that age where she hates everything (Sooo glad I'm over that one!) Maybe we'll all see the bright side someday. So anyway I slept over my aunts house last night. This morning she took me 2 get my hair cut but I don't know if I like it or not.. I love (loved?) my long hair and now its somewhat gone. Ms Siminski called me from East, she actually read the letter I wrote at the beginning of the semester about college.. So apparently I'm going 2 that alumni thing on Friday where we talk 2 little high schoolers about college. Fun times. I thought that they just threw it away or something but I felt good that something actually came out of it. Aww I miss Dwayne, I'm talking 2 him now 4 the first time in a while. I really want 2 go there. I mean even if he wasn't there who doesn't wanna go 2 Hawaii? Maybe that will give me motivation 2 get a job. I said maybe. The Drew is coming over 2morrow, then Wednesday I might go see Spongebob with Jen & James. I can't believe none of us has seen it yet.. So yeah, I'm outta here.. Cya <3ya

That was this morning. My mom took a pregnancy test and it came out positive. My parents are happy. Jenny is really upset. I'm borderline furious. It just started feeling like everything in my life was set, my family life was even alright.. And now this. They don't really think that it's going to be a bad thing but I can tell that it is. How are we going to afford college for me, as well as Jenny in a few years, and diapers, bottles, formula, clothes, etc for a baby? Not 2 mention everything else we need.. It's not just money. I really think that we're all set the way we are, 2 parents, 2 kids, 2 dogs.. It just works. We have trouble with the dogs sometimes and will a baby to make it any easier? I don't think so. They think its bad when Buddy keeps them up at night. Jeez.. I don't really know what 2 think yet. It still feels unreal. I'm uneasy about the whole thing, but I guess I really don't have a say.

Yesterday my dad brought me & Pippie 2 the mall. I was in Steve & Barry's and I saw Nick Guy, Ben, Lindsay and Ray. It was kinda awkward since I haven't seen any of them since school. Then when I went 2 leave, Elise cashed me out. I haven't seen her either. It was nice 2 see them again, and hopefully I can stop by Nikki's 2nite 2. Anyways I was thinking about the ""new"" year.. New means that I can start over, and I've made a couple goals~1) I'm giving up pop (Again! The last time I did I lost weight~Woo), 2) Start eating right and exercising more (I love going 2 the gym at school, shouldn't be a problem) and 3) Try 2 be happy as often as possible (And we all know cynical Mindy so.. We'll see).. I have faith in me this time, I guess that's all that matters. 
But hmmm, I wonder what I'm gonna wear 2nite? Well while I figure that out, I hope everybody has a great New Years.. Be safe kiddos~No drinking and driving! Cya <3ya

So anyways, Monday I went shopping with Dad & Jenny. Drew came over Tuesday night we ate dinner, went 2 Media Play and Target, then hung out at my house. Yesterday I had a chiropracter appointment and I think my back hurts now more than it did b4. I just woke up a little bit ago. It felt good 2 sleep 4 like 12 hours. I haven't done that in soo long. Don't know what I'm gonna do 2day. I wanna see people. Oooooh yeah, speaking of which the other day I was talking 2 my mom and I decided that I'm poison and that a lot of the friendships that I've made have all ended or turned bad, so it must be because of me.

Speaking of New Years, I think it is kind of strange that the high school straight edge drama crowd plans on drinking on New Years. It always seemed like in high school that everybody was so anti-drinking, but 1 semester at college changed it all. I haven't ever been against it so that's not why I'm complaining.. I just think it's weird that people changed their minds so quick when just last year they were getting upset because some kid showed up 2 a party drunk.. And things are just so different now huh?

"event","I was just listening 2 the radio and they were talking about how Christmas is becoming less and less of a Catholic/Christian holiday. I realize that this is true, and maybe it's better that way. I think it should be about giving and togetherness and all that good stuff, and it doesn't matter what religion you are. I hate how schools always ban Christmas stuff, maybe the religious stuff isn't right 4 school, but I think Christmas is an important part of life. I don't wanna sound ignorant, I know that Christmas is all about Jesus's birthday and stuff.. But I think it's a lot more than that, and everybody should be able 2 celebrate it. When I'm older, I don't know that I'll follow any particular religion, but I do know that I'm going 2 celebrate Christmas.. I wonder if I'm crazy for thinking that way, and if it should be a Catholic-only thing? Who knows? 
Well anyways, I'm going to help my mom with cookies and I plan on cleaning some of the house just 2 do something 2day. I wanna get my eyebrows done, I haven't gotten them done since prom.

I still haven't finished shopping 4 a couple friends I'm exchanging with. Later that night Drew picked me up. His tattoo is great, I love it! I will have 2 put pictures on here when it heals up a bit. We got some food and hung out at Jen & Mike's so the guys could celebrate their tattoos. Sunday we went shopping and I got my ring :-) I can't wear it yet, but I can(can't!) wait.. It's sooo nice, its like the one I wanted from online but it's not gold (I hate gold, so its a good thing!). I will definately put pictures of that on here 2 (If I'm the only 1 who cares, good enough.. I love it that much. HeHe) Thank you so much babe! I love you! I'm done shopping 4 him now, so that's good. He's harder 2 shop 4 than my mom. Ha. 2day has been pretty blah so far, it's way 2 cold and I have a lot 2 do but don't really feel like it.

I wonder what I'm doing this weekend. I definately have 2 go shopping 4 Christmas. It's good that I have money from my books that I can use 2 actually buy people presents. I guess it's also a good thing that I don't have any friends anymore so I don't have 2 spend much money. Wow, I'm just so very lucky. Riiight. I miss my friends. I keep saying it, but I really do hope that I get 2 see everybody during vacation. It sucked not seeing everybody at Thanksgiving.. Then again that could very well be my fault for not going 2 Nick's and not calling anyone but Jade and Dwayne.. So this time I will try harder.

I can't deal with how people act when they're cooped up in the house 2gether for that long. Looks like it's starting already. My parents are already going at it~the car, the snow, blah. I hate how people act in the winter. (And I always think it's bad in the summer until winter comes around.) Oh well. only like 5 more months of snow 2 go, huh? Next, I wish I could back down from my strong opinions. I would pretend that I'm completely 2 blame with the situation with Manda. Maybe things would be happily ever after, even if I knew that I was lying 2 myself. At least she would be happy.. It would make me happy just 2 have her there 4 me again. Lastly, I wish dreams came true. I have been having so many dreams lately about how things should be.. Perfect. Ben was in my dream last night. I miss him. We used 2 have so much fun. I want things back 2 normal: with him,  with everbody. I can't live inside my dreams, otherwise I would. It would be nice.. Anyways I have stuff 2 do so I shall be on my way. Cya <3ya

It was harder 2 believe that back then b/c I really thought that we were the indestructable best friends that we were supposed 2 be 4ever. I thought that I really didn't have anything 2 do with why she felt that way. Anytime she would complain 2 me about ""all of her friends"", I guess she meant me more than any1 else. I miss her so much. It makes me so sad 2 think that when I see her she's not the same person I used 2 know. I know that I've changed 2. I feel like sometimes when we see each other, we don't think 2ce about who we really are and how much we mean 2 each other. But, I don't know who we are anymore. That scares me. Spending 18 years with your best friend should overrule any guy that comes in2 the picture. I thought I made it that way when it was just me who had that 2 worry about. Now that we're both in the situation I don't know who's 2 blame: I think it's both of us. I just wish we could fix it. Like I've said many times b4, I would give up everything I have just 2 have her again. She was always the most important thing 2 me. Now there's just an empty space wher she should be. When I need somebody 2 talk 2, somebody 2 laugh with, somebody 2 give me advice.. It's just not there anymore. Instead the answering machine picks up or I get hung up on. I wish she could read this. I don't know that it would fix anything. But it would be a start. I love you Manda.. I'm sorry that things are the way they are.

Yeah, if your upset: write a letter, form an anti-fan club, do something productive. What that guy did was f*cked up. It upsets me so much that somebody could be sick enough 2 do that. I can't even imagine having that mindset. Seriously, I've been upset at the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC 4 a long time.. I remember when they used 2 be my life (oh, the lovely days of middle school), but it's not like I would do anything about it. I think of all the concerts I've been 2 and how I really thought the security was tight.. There's been times they patted every inch of me down, all the way 2 the shoes. They wouldn't even let me bring a CD in2 Blink & the Used's concert. But maybe it's not as good as that everywhere.. Bet it will be now. I'm not a fan of Pantera, but I've been really upset since I heard that. I just can't believe it..

I hope it's all that I expect it 2 be. Like many times before, I don't think my expectations will be met. It's a crazy thing. I want the best out of some situation and when it happens it never really meets my expectations. So many times I wish I were a kid again. Everything was better then.. Or at least I didn't realize when something bad was happening and it all just seemed better. I'm kind of in the mood 2 just cry, I'm not 2 sure why. Things aren't that bad. I'm just in 1 of those moods. I'm not even in a bad mood. I just feel like crap. Fix me. Cya <3ya

Pippie wasn't home Friday or most of Saturday and I kinda felt like an only child, which was very cool 4 1ce.. Sure I love my Pippie around.. But having all that attention was great 2. Saturday Aunt Michele updated our phone contract and now I have a new flip phone (I LOVE IT!) and unlimited nights and weekends, as well as more minutes and 100 messages a month. WOO! I'm pumped. Now I have 2 pay more 4 my phone, but still, it's so much more worth it not having 2 worry about minutes so much. My Drewby came over and we did what we always do: Sit around and do absolutely nothing :-) But we do that better than anybody else. As funny as it may sound, its nice 2 be able 2 burp in front of him, just be myself all the time. I've never really had that before and it's amazing. We watched Family Guy (of course) and tv, just hung out all day. I wouldn't have it any other way. Doing nothing with him is my favorite thing 2 do :-D So yeah I don't know whats going on 4 2day. Wanted 2 see Dwayne, don't know if I will. Don't know when I'm going back 2 school 2nite.. Tons of fun. I can't wait til Christmas break, which reminds me, probably should get on that ""getting a job"" thing soon. Well, that's all folks (Ha. Ha.) Cya <3ya

Yesterday I completely 4got that I had 2 write a 1st version 4 my writing project 4 this morning, so I did that all night.

Mommy dearest is coming 2 pick me up at 5ish and then who knows what I'll do with my night. I wanted 2 see Dwayne 2nite but he's going somewhere.. So maybe this weekend. Funny how a lot of my journal has been about him again. I just realized that there are only 15 days left til X-mas vacation. I really wish I had a job now so that I could get presents 4 everybody. Good thing I don't really have any friends otherwise I'd be in big trouble. Do Do Do.. I'm bored if you haven't noticed.. 1/2 an hour 2 spare b4 my computer exam and I've got nothing better 2 do but blab. So yeah, maybe theres other things 2 do on the internet besides Livejournal..

I went 2 sleep late, had trouble falling asleep.. Then I finally do. Something woke me up at 3:00ish.. A BOY IN MY BED. I look and think it's Drew so I don't freak out. Then remember that I'm at school. I went 2 the bathroom praying whoever it was left. But when I got back, the guy in boxers was still in my bed. I didn't know what 2 do. I tried 2 wake him up but it didn't work so I woke Bridget up and we went down 2 the front desk. Campus Safety, the RA on duty and the RC all came in and tried 2 wake this strange boy up and nothing worked. Finally, the emergency people came and somehow woke him up and got his information and everything and brought him out in this weird chair. Turns out it was 1 of the bitches next door's boyfriends who thought he was in their room.. And he was sooo drunk. Imagine that. Seriously haven't been that scared ever! I don't know if I'll ever sleep again. One things 4 sure, I'll be locking the door ALL THE TIME! I'm gonna go visit Corey. Gotta see somebody who's half way normal... PEACE Cya <3ya

I need that. 2day wasn't very productive. I pretty much just layed around all day. I played Scrabble with Pippie. She cheats! But it was something 2 do. 

I was just reading through everybody's journals about heart break, depression, sadness, angst and being let down, and it got me thinking: I don't want 2 feel that way anymore. It's easy 2 say now b/c I'm in love and happy and everything, but really.. When you think about it, we're all young still. Not everybody finds true love in high school, not everybody gets along with their parents, not everybody gets the best grades all the time; not everybody lives this perfect ""ideal"" life, and sometimes we go through hard times. I think I might be the queen of making things a bigger deal than they really are. Just seeing how I might look 2 other people when they read my journal has made me realize that pouting about it won't change anything. I know we all have our bad days and some people dedicate their whole journals to getting the negative things out, but there is so much more 2 life than all that. We all make a bigger deal about some things than they really are, but when you make everything a life-threatening matter, it just gets old.. I think people get depressed sometimes because they bring it on themselves. I know because I've been there. It's not just any one of my friends that have made me think so far into this. It's most of them. I wish the world didn't have to be like that. Things would be so much better if we all just enjoyed life a little more, smiled more. That's me on life. Goodnight world. Cya <3ya

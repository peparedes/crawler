"event","Today has been such a awesome morning.
I made Vege pizza last night and it was so good.
I have come to the conclusion that friends just plain kick ass.
I am lucky to have a lot of people I can call my friends. I have not really just sat down and thought about how rich my life is because of them and how well I am treated by them. So I wanted to say to all you people who are my friends thank you!
Now for not so mushy stuff
I woke up this morning, sun shining, masterbated for a hour, took a shower, got the kids ready for the day, came down stairs and ate cold leftover pizza and chased it with a beer. Not the best breakfast but it made me happy.
I have an appointment this afternoon with one of cowboys friends he is really nice and I have talked to him on the phone a few times but I have never met or seen him. He is getting a tat on his back of an eagle in all black. Its major $bling$ bling$ for us so Im glad to do it cause its been kinda slow. Hopefully with summer coming more people will be coming in. Anyway his name is Brian and he seems pretty nice and stuff.
I bought a new ink gun its pretty nice got it made for my hand had to send in measurements and everything its pretty expensive but I wanted to try it out and see if I like it better then old sparky my old gun.
Pete your a jackass I told you We already started the flash and we are waiting for a friend to send a picture in so Trevor can okay so just chill babybaby chill babybaby wait!
Kat I miss you sweetheart.
Becca I love you
Tabby your my girl
Bill, Quinne, Justin, Brit, even Cowboy Thank you"

"event","Today I woke up (cleverly enough) and as usual horny as all hell. Why do I do this to myself. I am in one of those romantic flirty moods where I just want to be kissed in the rain and roll around naked with a man I am in love with who loves me back. I had a dream last night I was pregnant. Which is impossible cause my baby maker is null and void thanks to stupid thinking on my part during a hectic time I got meh tubes tied. I woke up thinking I might want to have another baby. The thought has kinda stayed with me this morning and I think I am going to talk to my OB Doctor and see just what are my chances of getting it reversed. I know it isnt a 100% guarentee but at least if I try and fail I can at least say I tried. I am going to think about it alot more before I do it. Its just on my mind. That and sex. I dont know why I torture my body 
with so much porn. I think I may be the only woman alive who masterbates more then a 13 year old boy who just got his first Hustler. Something is wrong with me. I was on this health site the other day that said women hit thier sexual peak at ages 31-36. So wtf.. I am so ahead of schedule. This morning I turned on the tv and the Britany Spears video for ""Toxic"" was on. Turned me on so much and oops I did it again. yes I masterbated. I dont even like her for christs sake. Its not like she is Angelina Jolie or anything. The guy in her video was ok but damn.. Britany??? I am going to wear a short skirt that shows my underwear to work today. I just think its time for me to start being sexier. I am tired of always being a tomboy. Maybe my idea of sexy is alittle fucked up but I think a short skirt with panties that would show if I bent over is sexy. Cowboy told me I should wear heels and I dont own any. I told him I dont own any and hes like wtf what girl doesnt have a pair of heels. I dont. So I may go buy a pair of heels maybe thats why I feel so inadequate cause I dont own heels.
Then I think fuck him he doesnt matter anyways. But his thinking could be like other guys and be like wtf is wrong with me. I just want a guy to look at me and want me and think he cant live without me and if Im gone for more then 20 minutes he misses me and someone to tell me that Im doing a good job and they think Im pretty and not just a fuck pretty but a beautiful pretty. Someone to say I love you for me not cause Im a good fuck or I take pictures of my tits. I wish I was back in virginia at least that feels like home. I miss Rob so much. I wish I could just kiss him one last time. people told me its better to have loved and lost then never loved at all. I think they are full of shit. It hurts so bad to be in love and then have it ripped out from under you. They dont know shit. I use to take solice knowing he was watching down on me smiling and laughing at the kids. Now i am just left with emptiness. when the house gets quiet and the kids are in bed I just want to die and be with him. Instead I cry myself to sleep and wakeup and hug the kids and remember he is a part of them so maybe it isnt all bad. I just wish he was here and things would be perfect again. Id give up everything to have him again."

"event","I swear to god people. I love this girl. I have had more fun with her in the last few days then I have had in a long time. I really needed this weekend. We drank, went to a gay rodeo, drank some more, saw bats fly from under a bridge, drank alot more, went shopping, drank, gave her a new tatoo, drank some more. I swear I wish I could bottle her and keep her close. She is one of the beautiful people both inside and out. I am really going to miss her when she leaves tomorrow. Anyways I will write more later."

"event","Miss Becca finally made it to meh house..I greeted her at the airport holding a sigh reading ""Becca St.James Aspiring Pornstar and Belly Dancer"" She was amused. She is by all rights a very beauitful girl. How any man *cough John cough* could not fall head over heels in lust with her is just plain silly. Anyways I wont be writing much about work for the next few days seeing as I am playing hostess and wont be working as much. We have plans to go to a rodeo on Friday night, See the bats (minus meh kids add the liquor) on Saturday night with friends, Sunday I'm giving her a tattoo and she leaves on Monday. Anyways until next time kiddo's. Remember Jesus loves hip-hop."

"event","I walked into work today and Trevor asks me to take this call on the phone. Which always means bad news cause hes more patient then I am with idiots. So I get on the phone and this guy asks me to quote him a price for a tattoo. I ask him what it is. He said its a picture of his wifes vagina. He wants to come in, have her lay spread eagle on my table and freehand her cunt onto his inside wrist. I asked him if he was serious. He said yes. My next question is Why? His reply is that he is a trucker and he is on the road alot so when he gets lonely he can look at his wrist and think of her. I then ask why not carry a picture. He laughs and asks me again for a price. I ask him how detailed he wants it. He says he wants it to look just like her puss puss. I am looking at Trevor this whole time and hes got this smirk on his face like the little shit that he is. Sometimes people are idiots. So I tell him and I shit you not.. It depends how shriveled her puss lips are and how much detail I have to do to get it exactly but Im guessing around $800.00. He then in his Texas drawl goes ""Whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa darlin I aint Donald Trump err nothin, cant you do it for around $200? I said these exact words. #1 If I have to look at your wifes vagina to do this then yes you should be charged double that but I'm feeling generous today so for $800 your gettin off lucky. 2nd If I have to tattoo a picture of your wifes puss I have been staring at for the last hour.. Yes $800.00 is suffice. 3rd This isnt an auction take it or leave it. He hung up. Darn I so wanted to draw a cunt today too. Anyways Pete thought you might like that story. Miss you guys."

"event","In honor of Robs would-be 23 birthday I am hosting another one of my ""pantie parties"" For those of you in Virginia, you know what they are, for new friends scattered throughout the states I will explain. My pantie parties are basically a party lasting 2 days Starting the morning of May 15, leave your clothes at the door. You can chose to wear panties, bras, boxers, tshirts(guys only, thongs, g-strings etc etc. or chose nothing at all. Its your choice but full clothing is not allowed. If you arent comfortable with this. Do Not come. It is usually better to come with a partner, but if you are single there are a few people that may not be bringing a date or partner. If you have a problem with homosexuality DO not come. There are girl and girl couples and Guy and guy couples as well as straight couples. Beer, Vegan food, puff puff pass, wine and etc served. No meat is served or eaten in the 2 days so if you must have meat... Do not come.  In past parties I have had body painters, bands, Tattooist/piercers(free of charge), astrologers, Roleplayers of Vampire the Mascarade, Yoga instructors, belly dancing teachers and etc. This year We will have a Strip tease instructor, a local hardcore band, wine maker, tarot card reader and body massage instructor for our partying pleasure. There is lots of open couple sex, lots of nudity, lots of drinking, and lots of party games. If you are interested in coming let me know or if you have questions, just ask. This is my gift to everyone who knew Rob. I miss him tons and I think this is a perfect way to celebrate his birthday."

"event","oK, Tattoo workshop is going good. I had a class on ""Branding"" and bought some new wire prods to do some branding back at the shop. One of them is a heart, a star, a Anarachy symbol, a cross and a 8 ball looking thing (for all meh homeboys Yo!) I think when I get back to the shop I'm going to brand my ankle with the heart. Its kinda small and at least that way it will be a good test on the pain. I met a guy during the workshop that has over 20 brandings. I of course ask the wussy question.. ""Did it hurt?"" and he tells me to stop being a pussy and just do it. So I am gonna be like Mike and Nike and ""Just do it"" Yay for product placement in LJ!! I also found a Tuttnaur autoclave which I am going to check on Monday from this guy. New and in a box woot woot for only $1500 so I'm going to go check it out then have him FedEx it to us overnight. I also bought new headers and machine cover foils. It was like shopping just not fun! I also bought 3 used flash racks so whenever Trevor and myself get around to doing some flash art we can use them. I also went to a bar last night. California nightlife sucks. Or maybe I just wasnt in the mood for Barbies and little Paris Hilton wanna be's running amuck. I did get drunk and puke on my boots. I didnt get any in meh hair so thats a good thing. I havent slept yet and I think its like 6:30am Cali time. I am not adjusting well to the time change. I think my body has gone through every different time zone in the last 8 days. I turned on the tv and it gives me an option of purchasing porn. But it gives you a free look at it for 4 minutes. Isnt that enough time to spank it and turn the channel to whatever. Anyways the porn sucks too. Its not even keeping my attention. What a crappy morning. Maybe I will just masterbate and go to sleep. I need to get fucked."

"event","Well apparently Jesus needs coupons too.
Yesterday was a very weird day for me. I went to work mid afternoon, sun was shining, birds were chirping, Kids were happy, I felt like I was Mary Poppins skipping to work. Well we hired a front counter person.. For all those who dont know already Cowboy Punker quit his job in construction to be our front counter guy for the time being. We will see how that works out for all of us, but for now hes with us. So this guy walks in and hands cowboy a booklet of coupons. They look like $20 dollar bills but on the back side of the coupons it says ""Jesus Saves! $13.99 All you can eat Buffet"" Ok.. Now I bit my tongue when this guy was in our shop, because hey, Hes just the messenger and he needs a job. I hope hes getting paid big bucks to give these coupons out. So when he leaves me and cowboy start reading the coupon more. It says ""All you can eat Buffet, with Guest Inspirational speaker Brother Jimmy Nies."" ""Sit down, have a bite to eat and Praise God!"" I shit you not. Then in really small letters on the bottom of the coupon it says Buffet only $8.99 So I guess you are giving $5.00 to Brother Nies for his inspirational talk.. Ok #1 Who wants to go to a all you can eat buffet in the first place? Its like cows milling around a feed trough MoooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOo! #2 That food has been sitting there for god knows how many hours and I can just see some snot nosed little kid sticking his fingers in the mash potatos. Ewww. Anyways I just thought it was really funny. So anyways I picked up a client yesterday thats gonna be some big bucks. I finished an outline on him some other dude started from another shop I guess this guy didnt like the way he was doing it or something I dunno Anyways I finished his outline and he's coming back in 2 weeks for me to begin coloring it in. He already put money down Pete so quit hyperventilating. Trevor did this kick ass piece on a girl whose body is like 1/4 covered in ink. We are hoping she comes back. $$ bling bling $$
No piercings yesterday at all.  Oh. We have the newspaper coming out on Wednesday next week to feature us. I will flash my woodchuck smile for the camera.. Pete If you read this call Trevor he needs some of your old fashion kick in the ass advice.  I aint cuttin it I guess. Oh last night was pretty good. I went with Quinne, Justin, Cowboy Punker, Trevor, and Mark to see ""Taking Lives"" Staring my Lesbian dream Angelina Jolie. I swear I creamed myself like 3000 times during the movie. Shes so incredibly cute. Anyways thats all I have to say about that. I heart Texas."

"event","Ok, so this is my first journal entry and I feel like I should be writing about how ""so and so"" is so cute and how I cant wait to go over MaryAnne's for a cool Middle School like sleepover. Pete (My old boss at Virginia shop) asked me to do this journal so he could keep track of things via internet. Now I am wondering why we simply couldnt just do an email thing but I think he must have found this website and thought it was cool and decided to make my life even more of a living hell so I have to talk about what we are doing at the shop. I am also going to complain, whine, laugh, share my stories with whoever the hell thinks this is interesting enough to read, and just plain out ramble. Today at work I got the pleasure of sitting in on a interview for a counter/telephone person/receptionist thingy. Lemme tell you. This chick was an idiot. I try not to be mean to people but honest to god. She came in, clean fresh barbie skin, No tats, no piercings, never worked a day in her life much less reception type work and she wants a job.. So I ask her..""What makes you think you can do this job when you know nothing about tattooing or piercing or much less taking appointments?"" (Time needed to produce a tat and etc..) Her reply.. ""Chill out man"" I am like ""WTF did you just say to me?"" She says ""Just chill out man"" I then stood up and walked out.. Interview was over as far as Im concerned. Trevor (my coworker/owner) sees a piece of ass and tits and thinks ""Shes hired"" The girl is lucky I didnt punch her through the wall.. I mean seriously, who tells a prospective co worker/boss to chill out in an interview. So I dunno if half-baked barbie will get the job or not. Its not my descion but if it were me Id tell her to go ""F"" herself. Then as if that wasnt bad enough we had this hispanic guy come in, again no tats, no piercings, No English. I am not a brain surgeon by any means but c'mon.. He comes in with an interpreter, she asks for him, If we are hiring. I of course say Yes. I then ask what position is he applying for? She says front counter.. I just roll my eyes.. I ask if he can speak English, she says No. He laughs. I ask if he has a green card, she says no.. He laughs. I ask does he have a work permit... She says no.. I ask her if she enjoys wasting my time.. He laughs.. She says something to him in spanish and they walk out.. I mean c'mon!!!! This isnt rocket science. What the heck does he think he can do?... Ugh grumble grumble.. Well Pete I hope this is what you wanted to hear.. I will try to post a more happy happy joy joy
type of thingy later. Im tired and I just want to relax. People hurt my brain today. But I do heart Texas."

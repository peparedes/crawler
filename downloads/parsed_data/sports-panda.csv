I'm working for Fisheries, so far it's pretty slack. I read papers and file biological samples all day. In late May/june I'm going away to Vanderhoof (where???) for a month to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;Sturgeon (just like last year). I don't like being away from Leanne, friends, and skateboarding for so long... but atleast I don't have to spend any of my opwn money the whole time I'm away (Fisheries picks up the bill!!).

I&nbsp;got a HUGE tax return comming to me pretty soon... I can't decide what to do with it.. save it or spend it. I've been wanting a new synth and some recording gear for a while, so that might happen. I dunno! hah, in the meantime, I have virtually NO money... then I get my taxes back, paycheque from last job, and my new job all within a two day span. WTF!

I bought a Pointer Sisters record (Break Out), and I've been listening to it so much. My playlist at work had Rancid, Pointer Sisters, the Spits, Split Enz, human League, Neil young and the Jam on it. Totally all over the place.&nbsp;

OH! I bought a BBQ! I started setting it up at 5:30 and finished at 11:30. Leanne was going to bed and I was outside cooking stuff 'cause&nbsp;I was soo stocked that I had to use it before I&nbsp;going to bed.
In June, I want to have a BBQ and invite lots of people over. Play-off party... with or with-out the canucks in the series.. it would still rule."

"event","Since the band ended, my life has changed a lot.

Leanne and I moved into a place on Clark &amp; 11th, right next to China Creek skatepark (double woo!)
I got a (not so) temporary job at a soup place at Granville Island Market. All my shifts are early, and my days off are mon &amp; tues... this means that I don't go to shows and rarely see friends anymore.
The not seeing friends part is really lame. I feel like I'm loosing contact with everyone.
Since my shifts are early and Leanne's are late... we don't really see one another very much. Which is also lame.

I went for a job interview in Sidney (close to Victoria). It was with a fisheries consulting firm that I'd be stoked to work for. The interview was 4 hours long! They don't have any positions open right now, but they said that they'd like to hire me when something opens up. this means that I could end up working in Sidney or Nanaimo. Yikes. Who knows.. I'm applying for a few positions around Vancouver, but the chances of me being able to get anything decent here look pretty bleak.

After being rejected for a bunch of jobs in the past few months... it's starting to look like a&nbsp;university degree&nbsp;is the new highschool diploma... pretty much everyone has one. I don't get it... it the job posting says they're looking for someone with a BSc... why are they hiring people with a masters degree?! Just say that's what you're looking for! Arg!

Rempel and I want to start a band, but I have know idea how that would happen. I have the music for 4 songs already done... just no time or practice space anymore.

All my problems rest on getting a better job with better hours and actually calling my friends... even if I can't hang out too much right now."

"event","Lots of news.

5 years of Fun 100 ended for me on saturday. Total chaos! It was a rad time to hang out with tonnes of friends I don't see very often.

Leanne and I are moving in together March 1st. We have a place at Clark &amp; 11th right next to China Creek skate park, which rules for me! It'll be the first place above ground I've lived in since I lived with my mom. Unfortunately for Leanne, it isn't really too great for her work hours since she's at Kits Beach Starbucks.

My job at UBC ended a week ago and I haven't been able to find another biology job. And with rent and damage deposit due&nbsp; and my bank account dwindling rapidly... I was forced to take a job at a soup store in Granville Island Market. Free soup for me!
I'm still applying forother jobs. I have tues and wed off so I can do interviews then. 

I applied for my masters degree for this comming school year. I doubt I'll get in, pretty harsh process to qualify. Getting accepted into a masters program is like winning a competition. I'll find out within the next few weeks.

I'm looking to start a new band sometime in the next year with Rempel and maybe Tim McLeoud. We'll see, I don't even have a place to jam right now. I wanna give it some time, write a few songs and see what happens."

"event","We played our last show tonight. A lot of friends came to see us off, as well as the Badamps as it was their last show too! Even my mom came out to see us and it was her first time at one of our shows. I'd been looking forward to playing this show for weeks, I slept only 1.5 hours last night because I was so excited! We set up and then we were told that we couldn't play. Ryan then said that we were allowed to play a few songs... So we started to play. Somewhere in the second song, Kyle (one of the promoters from the ""Kyle &amp; Khol"" duo) started ripping the cords out of my synth and yelling at me. I was a little startled and didn't know what to make of it. I plugged back in and continued playing. It was our last show!!! Then he unplugged everyone and pushed me out of his way. That's when I grabbed him and pushed him into the wall and told him to stop. He came at me and I pushed him away again. The microphones were turned off and the crowd more than enough made up for it by singing all the lyrics loudly. It was rad.
As soon as we found out the police had shown up, we stopped. I appologized to Kyle for loosing my cool, but he wasn't in the mood to hear me saying sorry. I guess you can't really blame the guy since he'll be out money for some of the damages caused by the kids at the show (I heard that one of the windows was broken).
Frank Rumbletone said that he thought the show was ""badass"" and said it was better than anything he could've wanted to see. I was stoked.

All in all, I was upset that a bunch of kids didn't get to hear the songs they had been asking us to play.&nbsp; But... getting shut down, the crowd singing when we were unplugged, and the huge turnout of people having fun really made up for anything negative. Not a bad way to end at all.
STOKED."

This is the how much Ontaio hated out van. When we pulled over the tire looked like this. With every passing semi truck the tire came closer to falling off.
Thanks again Linnea and Joel for helping us out so much!

We played Fuck Me Dead's last show. sucks that so many rad bands have called it quits in the past year. We also got to play the Mint records afterparty for the New Pornographers. Mint told us that we weren't allowed to play any other show that night... but we really wanted to play thew Fuck Me Dead show. So we played under the name ""Punk Vacation,"" which is a terrible B-movie about punks that take over a town. That was definately the best show out of the two. Hands down. So much fun. the Mint show was wierd... I dunno. It always seems wierd playing to a crowd you've never seen before in your home town. There were some familiar faces... it felt more like a show on tour.

Last night I saw the music video from Mark and Travis' new band (from Blink 182). Not as good as I thought it would be... still pretty pop-punk."

The front right tire nearly came off the van just outside of London Ontario. We were very close to rolling! The first thing the towtruck driver said when he saw our van was ""holy fuck!!"" yeah, that's how close it came.

We've been staying with Linnea and Joel in Waterloo since friday night. They've been really great. We got to play our Waterloo show with the other band's gear. It was pretty funny... we were more like a Fun 100 cover band.

Our van might be ready tomorrow night.... at a price somwhere around $1000. We've missed a tonne of shows and I'm not sure how we're going to pay for the repairs or the gas to get back home.

On top of that, my roommate just let me know that she's leaving. rad...

Seeing the rest of Canada and finding out that nearly everyone pays less rent than Vancouver and has WAY sweeter old character homes... well, it makes me feel like a sucker! Hah! It's true though. Really, Vancouver is only rad becaus of the people there... Montreal, Toronto, and Halifax are amazing cities. I'd love to visit them all again.

I spent all day walking and skating around Toronto. I got on the show Daily Planet and almost got onto MOD on Much Music. This security guard asked me if I was going in, I asked ""in where?"" He said ""MOD"" and I was like ""Uh.. yeah.. sure!"" But there was a few too many. So I got a free pen and postcard. Hah!

It was fun to be loud and not drunk.

Thursday we played at the Red Room. We opened for the Tranzmittors and the Subhumans. The Tranzmittors ruled! The Subhumans were.. well... old. It's just not very believable when a 50yr old man who has a morgae, a family, car, and a job AND is singing about anarchy and and not giving into society. He kept saying that he advocated irresponsibility and kept singing about society... and how he's sick of being told what to do. Shit.. it was soo tired. Good laughs were had. Fun times with friends. I really wished Leanne was there.

Tonight we played an all-ages show at the warehouse. Skateboarding, friends, and punk rock. I wish Leanne was there... But I had a rad time with some of my best friends.

"event","Update!!

I have been very busy lately. I flew up north with work to work on BC's most northern and most endangered Sturgeon population. 2 weeks in northern BC... yikes! I'm still recovering from all the bugs! However, all the work outdoors gave me a great farmer-tan/watch-tan!! Hah.

Small changes:
-started running about a month ago and I feel great! 
-got back into skating nearly everyday!!
-avoiding indie rock shows and all the shallow fashion-minded people that go with them
-eating less at Bon's and cooking more
-riding my bike to work (UBC) on nice days
-reading more! less tv!!

I bought a couple books on the discount table at UBC bookstore. One on the Bible in modern culture and the other on Sartre.

I'll render my full opinion on existentialism and Sartre as soon as I'm finished the book.. but right now, I am really not convinced about existentialism. Given our present understanding of the systems governing space and the natural world, I just can't agree with it. Interesting, but it just seems a little dated... I'm interested in why Sartre really makes no (or very litle) refference to the Natural world. Are we really that removed from the same forces that govern it? I'm also a little confused about how humans are the only beings that can make choices. Even in his day, scientists had shown that with out training, various animals can make their own choices.
Anyway.. I'm rambling. I'll keep reading.

I think I should just start a different journal for rants.. 'cause I have lots!"

Living next to Bon's is pretty alright hey ?!
I skate a lot, get to see friends and leanne a lot more, and am walking distance to band practice.

Last week ruled to the max. Played two sweeet shows, Rempel's b-day, and first paycheque from the new job... I've never made this much money before. It rules!

My house is comming together really well. The roommate situation is really good. We get along really well and she has a tonne of nice appliances etc.

I started running again, eating really well (lost too much wieght in Nanaimo...), and working out again.

I still have homework anxiety. I haven't quite realized that it's OVER!! My 7 years of university are OVER!!!!!! But, I still feel like I need to be doing things. I'm still increadibly high-strung. So I've focussed my fidgetting and excess energy into getting into better shape and skateboarding.

I also bought a new synth. An old yamaha cs-15. Well, I guess that doesn't mean much to most people. It has lots of buttons and dials to play with. Horray.

I'm posting my new numbers in the next post.

They were amazing though, really really good.. just waaaaaay too long.

Saturday night, Fun 100 played in Chilliwack. It started out pretty dismal. Barley any kids showed up... but by the time we played, it was pretty packed. It was one of the most energetic crowds we'd ever played to! So much clapping and singing along.
Before that, to kill the time.. we decided to set up targets (pop bottles) and hit them with rocks.. really, other than be a farmer, growing pot, and getting married by the age of 19.. what else is there to do in Chilliwack?! ...And no, Chrissy, they don't have Aids there yet.
We dedicated a song to a kid who hada broken arm. After the set he asked if we wanted to skate with him. I asked him how he broke his arm. ""Skateboarding,"" he replied.

"event","I'm getting a little frustrated by the whole agruement about seal hunting.

All I've heard is how bad it is to kill poor little defenseless cute seals. really.. is that it? Is the fact that they're cute the reason not to hunt them? Now.. I'm not a proponent of hunting. Not at all. But, with that said, I haven't heard one real arguement by the anti seal hunting side. All these celebrities all of a sudden jump on the bandwagon with Paul McCartney and start threatening Canada because of the hunt. I saw a thing on TV where Paul McCartney is laying on the ice up north trying to pet a baby seal... surrounded by cameramen. How scared and stressed do you think the baby seal was? I wonder if it's mother might reject it after being touched by humans so many times.. hah, the seal almost bit him too.. what an idiot.

Anyway, how about some real aguements for the end of the hunt! Here are some I thought up:
1)Can you accurately get an estimate of the seal population over the extremely large expanse of ice that they inhabit?!
2)If not, can you actually hunt them sustainably if you don't have an accurate population estimate?
3)Are their genetically distinct subpopulations that may be at increased risk?
4)What is the impact of the large amount of hunters traveling through the arctic. This is interesting since it's a VERY sensitive ecosystem.
5)Is this hunt sustainable if only the pelts are taken?
6)Should the hunters be forced to use the seal meat as well? Instead of only taking the fur and leaveing the rest of the seal? - since it freezes right away, it's not useable to any scavenger animals! Therefore, when the ice melts.. it sinks into the ocean.
7)Is the sea hunt really that economically viable? Is it the only option for unemployed fishermen?
8)People say the ""clubbing"" is in humaine. Is it? Does it kill them quickly? Are their better options?
9)Do the seals have enough pups each year to sustain the same kill rate every year?
It's sad that most of these questions remain unanswered.. and there is still a hunt. This ignorance is really the saddest thing about the seal hunt.

Okay, I know not too many people may be interested in this post... I just hate it when people are against the hunt of something JUST because it's cute and furry.. far more creatures are going extinct everyday in our own province and no one cares because they might be insects or reptiles. Baby seals are just a far more  easy thing to get people to feal sorry about because it tugs on their emotions."

The place as to meet these 3 criteria:
Cheap, clean, and near the skytrain.

Job prospects are starting to sound good! I got a really good reference from my internship in the fall. So stoked cause it might get me a dreamy job (fisheries biologist!!) Just sooo dreamy.

The third week is the worst, that's when I start writting finals, finish my major papers, go to job interviews, and look for a place to live in Vancouver. 

With Bruce away on tour, I'm getting used to not playing shows and practicing.. and I like it! It's really nice to actually have my weekends. I can relax, not take the ferry, and I can get some reading/homework done. I'm pretty stoked for summer too, for much the same reason (YSP is going to europe). This means that I'll be able to work a lot and actually do things in the summer besides worrying about how much money I can save for tour and how I'll find a job when I get home.

If flies need dead bodies to lay their eggs in... why aren't there tonnes of flies in zombie movies?? And wouldn't the flies end up eating all the zombies over time?

This leads me to believe one of two things.. either flies don't really lay eggs in dead flesh.. or zombie movies aren't vety realistic.

"event","I won an award for academic excellence! So stoked! I got a cheque and a certificate. Soo blessed. I actually have a little bit of money saved up to help me move and pay my first rent cheque.

With no homework to do and a much welcomed break from my relentless routine of papers and assignments, I actually had time to read this weekend! I finished two books and picked another I had put off for years.

This totally applies to me
""...I was cranked to fith gear, and everything I did, I did on a deadline. I burried myself in accomplishments, because with accomplishements, I believed that I could control things, I could squeeze in every last piece of happiness before I died."" well.. all except for the death part.. it's pretty accurate.

*okay.. play some sort of empowering music (Europe-the final countdown (etc))in your head while reading this.. it'll make it sound so much more important and groundbreaking than it is.. cause it really isn't*
A recent realization:
I guess I'm afraid that if I'm not always busy, or engaged in something, that I'll miss out on something important. I'm not afraid of death, but really of not experiencing as much as I can while I'm alive. But.. out of this come the paradox of being so busy trying not miss anything, you end up missing most of the important things in life.

This weekend, I went on quite the rant about how much I hate celebrities and hollywood... more specifically, the worship of the celebrity. I guess I don't like how superficial it all is.. how meaningless it all is.. and really how it doesn't generally (and I suppose it can) add anything meaningfully to our culture! How many more award shows do we need? why do people care so much about them (the award shows and celebrities)?? Are people so unhappy with their own lives that they need to focus on the lifes of celebrities? This is the source of so many insecurities! People look up to these serigally-altered-botox-injected-pampered people as something that they should resemble.. how unfortunate. I know that not all celebrities are like that.. but I'm not talking about the 10% that actually use their ""powers"" for good instead of self-indulgance.
How about people become a little more invested in their own lives and in the lives of the people around them.
Okay.. I think I cut that short. Probably a good thing."

Here's the ship I was on:
<img src=""http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/fleet/photos/ricker2.jpg"" />
The ocean is an intense place.. one minute it's sunny and calm.. the next, it's raining and waves are crashing on to the deck. 
Here's the view for most of my trip:
<img src=""http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a87/dirtcola/IMGP0547.jpg"" />

The first day I was aboard, we went through 6 meter waves... the whole night was like being on a rollercoaster that never stopped.. luckily, that was the roughest we went through.. and the only time I got seasick. 

It was such a cool feeling to be one of the scientists aboard.. we were treated soo well! I had all my meals served to me and my bed made for me everyday! We were collecting juvenile salmon on the open ocean to look at the health and productivity of salmon poulations.. I was constantly surrounded by of biologists who I could geek-out with. Soo nice to be able to gab about science all day everyday! 

I made lots of contacts and may have some pretty good prospects for jobs this year. Here's hoping!

This place is seriously beautiful. Long white sandy beaches with tall haystack rock structures, old growth forrests, and the open ocean. We've also been doing studies along the sheltered inlets. We've seen starfish nearly 1 meter across!! Plus seals, se lions and whales! 

This place is in a tear in the fabric of time. Currently it's 1992 and everyone is in full grunge gear: layers of sweaters, long underwear, and they play Collective Soul in the caffeteria. However.. time jumps ahead when the african cheff is working.. he blasts Little John, Notorious B.I.G, and Carribean music. It rules. 

This place is freezing! It's been sunny.. but windy and cold. The stars at night are crazy! You can even see the milky way. Today it even snowed.

We all work pretty hard all day.. I deffinately have no trouble sleeping when we're all done. At night people party pretty hard. But not me... I've been in the library every night to finish my assignments before I head off on the boat on the 28th.

All in all it's been a pretty good trip so far! This place is beautifull.. but would be a harsh place to live.

I should know, I had to walk parts of it every week and count no existant fish. My assignmnet was to take a position on why no fish returned and defend it. 
So that's what I did. The first few points were fairly obvious... but the last got a little attention.
The river has a fish hatchery because most of it is behind a large dam that prevents further migration. I don't agree with most hatchery practices and the politics behind them. It was pretty obvious in my explanation. I was fairly objective in my arguement, citing facts about how hatcheries reduce the genetic variability in populations over time.. eventually leading to inbreeding and lowered survival. I said that habitat creation is a much better alternative. My one proff, an avid fisherman, said, ""well, who do you think pays for those habitat projects? fisherman! And hatcheries supply fish to fisherman.""
So.. that's where another debate started. I couldn't believe that someone who works at a university, even as an associate proffesor, would use such circular logic in an arguement! I mentioned that it was circular logic and that the ends don't justify the means.. that was even worse. Lucky for me I had another proff on my side.

I really like this program.. everything is so contentious! Everyone has a different opinion.. and half the people are in favor of conservation, preservation and fisheries management... while the other is more interested in resource use, sport fishing, and the socioeconomics of it all.

Really it comes down to values. Human values. I've never felt like more of a hippy than I do right now... man.. if it wasn't for being educated, I'd probably be sprouting dreadlocks right now and ""grooving out"" to Jack Johnson while rambling, ""but who will speak for the animals?""


Gross. very very gross."

"event","Two midterms tomorrow and a paper due! No sleep tonight I guess.

Next paper is due on wednesday. I have to get 3 of my papers done for March before feb 22! I leave for my trip research trip to Bamfield Marine Station on the 23rd-26th and leave for the next research trip up to Alaska on the 28th! Busy busy month!

I talked to Andrew a little while ago at the Abbotsford show and he filled me in on the gossip about old friends etc from Abbotsford and beyond. Shitty to find out that my exgirlfriend is not only divorced now.. but is pregnant too! Yikes. That's just depressing.

Anyways..
Oh! Fun 100 is having their last show for a couple of months on the 16th at the marine club.

Back to the world of marine ecology.. I have no clue how I'm going to get it all done for tomorrow!"

"event","Tonight I was at the raddest beach here in Nanaimo. We were looking in the tidal pools and identifying organisms for marine biology. I wore gumboots... my toes are friggin freezing and I have a cold. I am gross and snotty.. but anyways... the moon was nearly full, and the stars were bright.. soo nice out here when it's not raining.. vancouver doesn't have anything on clear Nanaimo nights (ehhh... maybe).. soo many stars."

"event","Man.. I'm such a nerd. I feel guilty for neglecting homework to read a paper of sockeye salmon nutrient cycling. I also have a stack of papers I ""get"" to read if I finish reading ones for my classes.. it's like a little reward for completing the one required ones.. man.. such a nerd.
Oh well..
Looks like this nerd may be getting some scholarships comming his way soon! Very good chance.. the head of the dept. came mentioned that I had applied for a bunch of scholarships and that it ""might be looking good"". Since he's the guy who makes the choice.. I think I got atleast one of them. Very very needed.. very close to being broke. No more plane rides for me!

Saw my dermatologist today.. turns out she has no explanation as to why I lost nearly 300 hairs overnight last month... She said everything seems fine. Which doesn't make me feel better.. just confused. Oh well. The mysteries of life. But if it happens again, she'll put me on some sort of really mild drug to reduce my cortisol levels blah blah blah... anyways... yay.

My internship supervisor is trying to find me someone to work with for my masters!!! This rules! Me + higher education = stoked.

I found a few jobs in Vancouver that look promising. All are for fisheries biologists.. one for people recently graduated or in a co-op program.. *ahem!* that's me to a ""T!""

Tomorrow night I'm going on a field trip to study the intertidal zone here in Nanaimo. My marine biology class is begining to rule."

"event","Oh shit.. I got an email asking me to submit my resume to BC Conservation Foundation. I volunteered there during the fall... so I'd be practically guaranteed the job! Problem: It's here in Nanaimo........... I really want to leave here as soon as possible. I mean, this would be a good place to have a career, but I need to be on the mainland. Maybe the branch of BCCF in Surrey is hiring.. hmmm.

Major job hunting begins in March."

"event","On friday Fun 100 recorded 3 new songs! But the hard part was getting to the mainland to do that!!! The busses don't leave early enough for me to catch the 8am ferry.. so I was going to take the expensive little ferry to downtown vancouver... but when I got there they had mechanical problems which ment I was out of luck... so, already late, I took a float plane! $67 poorer and 20 mins later I was in Vancouver. The coolest part was seeing Stanley Park from the plane.. we were maybe flying at 200ft, so we were pretty close to the trees.. soo rad. The windy weather made for a very intense flight.

I've been in a debate on salmon management and aquaculture via email for over a week and I'm loving it. I need that! It feels good to be challenged.. I crave it!

6 years of my life have been spent on school.. I'm undoubtably committed to my future career and research goals.. however, once again it's caused turmoil in my life.. a constant through out my time spent as a young adult. It's tricky to start thinking about the future when you have still more schooling to do, especially when you're so heavily invested in it! I guess I'm just always wanting bigger and better for myself. You mean.. there's nothing after Phd?? I have to stop somewhere?! Pssssh.."

You cannot eat, breathe, or sleep without analyzing each action to death.  You're usually sombre, depressed, lethargic, but you can be nearly glad from time to time.  You wear whatever you can find on your cluttered bedroom floor.  You carry books, notepads, reading glasses with you wherever you go.  You have friends, but only a few who truly get where you're coming from.  You frequent coffee shops, libraries, and the less crowded bars.  You're obsessed with past people, past ideas, past lives.

I guess this is pretty true.. I'm a little more stoked on life that this though. Jack Kerouac.. I guess.


Recording new songs on friday!!! I think we're releasing something this late-spring/summer"

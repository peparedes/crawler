So anyways after that I had to stop at McDonalds and change...but I couldnt get any food cuz I gave up fast food! Im proud of myself. So then I went to WP to help some of my teachers from last year get their rooms ready...cuz Im nice like that. Plus they give me subway when I do it lol. Its not like I mind doing it...and I dont mean to sound creepy but they dont treat me like some student that they only see because they have to. They treat me like an actual person...like Im just one of them kinda! ok well moving on...I stopped at Laurens after that because I havent seen her in FOREVER! And what luck she was making her Oh-So-Goodly Mac-N-Cheese right as I was getting there! Gosh that girl is so kind to share that stuff with me! But I only had a tiny bit this time cuz I had just had subway! so we sat and talked while we ate but I had to go pretty quick because I really needed a shower and a nap! So I went home and did just that! But tomorrow Lauren and I are goin to WP again to help out and then going to Tony's for lunch! I LOVE THAT PLACE! Steak Sandwich here I come!

I mean it wasnt cool because if you need an ambulance then someone is hurt...but it was cool cuz I have never gotten to call one before! SO anyways after that Me, Hazzy, Kar, and Steph went to KFC. That was great fun! But then we had to say our goodbyes and be on our way! So then I was looking forward to getting home for some ice cream...(I know Im a piggy...what can I say?) but as I was passing through WP I noticed that Mr. Champagne was there. So I stopped to say hi and ended up being there for like an hour and a half. But it was fun cuz Jenny and Lauren showed up on their bikes...and when they went to someone elses room...I hid their bikes in Mr. Champagne and Mr. Klebe's rooms...IT WAS HILLARIOUS. They were freaking out. oh good humor. I was also happy because Lauren decided to give me her slurpee! What a kind, kind girl. So yeah soon after Lauren and Jen left...I departed and got home and took a HOT shower and a LONG nap. But I didnt nap till I watched the highlights from the X-Games...Loved it. Travis Pastrana is mmm mmmm good...haha. well now that I have shared with you I must be going! Practice at 7:30 am!"

So anyways back to today...After I called my grandma I had to go babysit Nathan and Marina. They were perfect...again! I loved it...who wouldnt love getting $6.00 an hour to watch someone else's t.v. and run around in their backyard! HELLO! But yeah I was right about to fall asleep cuz Im so darn tired...Im glad their dad came home before I did! How embarassing would that be...ouch. So yup...

I think its between Ashley and Lindsay right now...but hmmm...guess we will find out! 

But yeah today was confusing! I thought I was supposed to babysit tomorrow...but I guess the lady meant today. So she shows up at my house and we spent like a half an hour arranging everything so that I could watch her kids while she went to the doctor. Well usually I would just be like...well I cant do it. Cuz I was supposed to go out to lunch with my grandma today...then tryouts. So normally I woulda been like SORRY! Cant help ya...but this lady is pregnant! So obviously its really important that she sees the doctor when she needs to! So I had to take my brother with me...and we just chilled at their house. I was tryin to call one of the coaches...and after I called about a million people I finally got TC's cell number! But anyways the kids mom came home early so she took me to practice and I got there on time! Then my grandma came and brought me subway...even though I couldnt eat it till after practice...and she took my brother home. Then after tryouts I FINALLY got to go home again!

"event","Today was cool. I got to see a few people I havent seen in FOREVER! Well first I went to tryouts and they werent too bad. My legs are killing me though because we ran the stairs for 10 minutes. and we had to jump alot. But after I came home to a lovely message from Alicia saying that she wanted to hang out today! So I showered and met her at McDonalds and we chatted there for a while...then we went back to her house and watched some t.v. After that we went to the mall and I FINALLY found some shoes! YAY! and I got my watch fixed. So yeah we just hung out and talked alot. We had some grand fun in FYE listening to the backstreet boys and Nsync lol. It was nice to hang out with her cuz I havent seen her in SO LONG. So anyways I came home and we went out to dinner at the 1st Wok Buffet. I LOVE THAT PLACE. Weston said he does too. So I guess we are both just cool like that. But anyways I saw my friend Cliff that I grew up with...man I havent seen that kid in FOREVER! Man let me tell you...it really sucks that he doesnt live around here anymore cuz that boy has definetly gotten good looking over the summer. Hes adorable! and hes such a nice person...awe darn. Why do the perfect ones always move away! But yeah seeing him definetly brightened my day. I wish I woulda known he was in town though cuz he leaves tomorrow morning! It really makes me think about how much we dont appreciate people untill they are gone. and it sucks. It also sucks when u REALLY appreciate someone and they dont understand how much they mean to you. Thats depressing. REALLY. well im gonna go find something to do...blah."

(if you werent there...dont ask) but that was a good time. And me and Phil(J-Schirt) watched the X-Games with Chuck and Harold. OH DANG! Travis Pastrana had the worst wipe out. I was about to scream cuz I REALLY wanted him to win. So the Canadians finally left today! YAY! then after I went to Laurens house to swim. And Weston, Drew, Chelsea, Rachel, and Sarah Breen all came too! that was also a good time. We made bracelets and Drew made one all by himself and it actually turned out right! good job drew. I made one for Weston and it turned out nicely except I broke it. But he wore it anyways. Thanks. But yeah after everyone except me and Chelsea had left, we went and got Laurens dog from the kennel and then took Chelsea home. Then I went to Laurens for a little bit and chilled. Then her dad brought me home and I watched the last part of the X-Games. I was mad cuz I missed almost all of it except for the last 3 riders in the free style compition for MX. But thats ok cuz I got to see Pastrana in his last ride. He had the worst wipeout last night. I was suprised he rode today! But even though he was banged up he had a pretty good ride and took second! WAY 2 GO! Nate Adams won though. and he did have a good ride so I guess he deserved it. Well try outs are tomorrow and I REALLY dont wanna go. I HATE RUNNING. especially when u have to do it for 2 FREAKIN HOURS! AH! well I better go prepare for this pile of crap.

So I rollerbladed to his house...and it was SO HOT! so we chilled and played with his dog Gus...haha I love that name. But yeah I was supposed to go running after...but with the heat and the rollerblading at least 4 miles there and back...I figured that would be good for today. So I went to McDonalds instead lol. Then I stopped at Laurens cuz we were gonna go get slurpees but she wasnt home. Oh well its all good. Finally I got to take a much needed shower...it felt so good. I really dont like being sweaty...ick. After that I chatted with some friends...then I spent about an hour figuring out how to hook up our DVD player. My parents were convinced it wouldnt work...but dont worry...I figured it out. haha. So of course after my hard work I watched a movie. BRUCE ALMIGHTY! I love that movie...hillarious.

OMGSH! I wrote a poem and I liked it...so if you wanna you can read it and tell me what ya think!

If you want me to smile,
Then just sit and talk a while,
I dont mind taking time,
To listen to it all,
And it doesnt even matter.

We can lay around all day,
and never accomplish a thing,
And when we look back on it all,
I know that it was the most important day off all.

We can listen to the screaming silence of a setting sun,
We can lay in the grass and count the stars one by one,
There is no point,
To anything worth doing,
Its time we opened up our minds,
The world is there and no one wants it.

"event","Today was so much fun! at first I was SO bored! but then Lauren was like ""HEY! come to my house!"" so I rollerbladed through the rain to go to her house...haha that was fun too. Then being the awesome person she is, she greated me with a smile and HOT CHOCOLATE! YUM! then another nice thing was she made that Mac & Cheese that she makes OH SO GOODLY! lol. So we ate and watched Bambi...I love that movie. 8-) Then our beloved ASHLEY showed up. she thought she would catch us with boys...haha yeah right. we are way to smooth right Lauren! lol. so after hangin out with her...we hitched a ride with the AWESOME Deb Blazejewski...(much love lol) to Westons house. Haha that was an adventure! We got there and were greeted by Weston, Josh, and Shane. Well we werent really greeted...and they were just foolin around outside...but anywho! We played basketball for a while (Me, Josh, Weston, and Shane) Lauren was a stinky party pooper lol. but I cant be to mean cuz she let me use her shoes lol. Then we went downstairs and Josh and Weston played nutball with pool balls...smart guys. So then Chelsea and Megan show up...and soon Justin did too. and Weston was DIEING to watch A Walk to Remember...but it didnt work. too bad. Then Justin, Weston, and Josh tried to get us to play a pool game with them...haha. Then they narrowed it down to just me and Megan...welp that didnt happen lol. WOW then it all broke out...everyone was BEATING on eachother...except me, Josh, and Megan. we were smart and watched. then something that I wont say...happened to Lauren. So Weston got PISSED cuz we wouldnt tell him...but then he wasnt pissed anymore. So we chilled outside for a while...everyone was gonna go out and do something...but they were all really nice and waited for my dad to get there before they left so I wasnt a loner! THANKS WESTON! and everyone else who didnt really care except Megan Lauren and Chelsea. Oh and thankyou Chelsea for escorting me to my car! That was to kind! welp...I hope everyone had fun tonight! i gotta go get some sleep cuz I gotta go to MSU for 4 days...IM GONNA MISS MY FRIENDS!!! 8'( dont forget about me lol.

Advice for today- Never throw a sleeping person in the pool...especially when that person is Chelsea Samson. Its very dangerous and it pisses that person off. I love you Chelsea. haha

"event","Well. Today was pretty good...so far. First there was basketball...we were supposed to go to WP but half ended up at HHS instead. So those of us at WP had to RUN from there to HHS...but being the kind soul that he is...Coach Collins picked us up part of the way there. Thank God cuz my side hurt SO BAD. Then we went over plays...that didnt turn out to good. But after we had a talk with the coaches and we were all havin a good time...i guess. So then I registered for Can-Am. Good times. Then I went to Laurens litte gathering at her pool. Well you know...I expect to see ppl that I know there...I only knew one of the guys (Weston) and the other 3 were older guys I have never seen before. Two of them were 16 and the other one was 15. Oh it was so much fun. We got like 10 of Laurens towles soaked! Cuz the guys kept throwing Chelsea in the pool everytime she got a new towel. Then they got me twice and Lauren and Amanda a few times too. Oh but dont you worry...we got our shots in too! but now I must be off to Babysit!! NATHAN!! hes so awesome...him and his sister are like perfect...the never complain, they never fight, and so I get paid for like running around in their back yard and watching movies. GRAND."

"event","Well this afternoon....i went shopping for a couple hours with my cousin...it was fun! i bought a bunch of silly stuff but hey...im happy. Then we went to Chi-Chi's and my grandma was checking out this guys butt...it was hillarious. but the food was AWESOME! yummy. im still super tired...and my legs kill! but tomorrow is a day off finally! right now im listening to this song...and i love it. Its Should've Listened by Nickelback...
Why's there clothes all over the floor.
Don't remember them being here before.
Smell of perfume isn't here.
Why's lipstick on the mirror?
And still I don't understand.

No pictures left in the hall.
It's plain there's holes in my wall.
Where the hells my credit cards?
Why the hells my wallet in the yard?
And still I don't understand.

[Chorus]
Well now, I guess I should've listened.
When you said you've had enough.
A little trick I picked up from my father.
in one ear and out the other.
Why's love got to be so tuff?

Should've seen the look on my face.
My shits all over the place!
Why's this happening to me?
Why'd you take both sets of keys?
And still I don't understand.

Well now, I guess I should've listened
When you said you've had enough
A little trick I picked up from my father
in one ear and out the other
Why's love got to be so tuff?

Ohh, Well I guess I should've listened

There's clothes all over my floor.
I don't remember them being there before.
There are no candles in here.
Lipstick still on my mirror.
And I still don't understand.

Well now, I guess I should've listened.
When you said you've had enough.
A little trick I picked up from my father.
In one ear and out the other.
Why's love got to be so tuff?

Well now, I guess I should've listened.
When you said you've had enough.
A little trick I picked up from my father.
In one ear and out the other.
Why's love got to be so tuff?

Its an awesome song... you should listen to it sometime! well im out...peace ya'll."

"event","main thing i was gonna say was.......i've been thinkin a little lately about&nbsp; going ahead and getting a tattoo.&nbsp; after given lots of thought and time to prepare what was going to be glued onto me for the rest of my life COMMA, i think i found the best solution....something simple yet meaningful to me and my family.&nbsp; tribute to my grandmother who i miss dearly......... simply&nbsp; stating ""a heart of gold"" with some other art&nbsp; .&nbsp; recently getting this idea from having her in my thoughts lately.&nbsp; i'm afraid my family will go back into this depressing cycle again, but i think my mother will respect the fact that she is still in my everyday thoughts and just wish she were still alive w/ us.&nbsp; alright now that we've all gotten emotional...........i will leave this with more thought.........before i do anything final. but&nbsp; as expected, i will need support to get it done. i've decided to get it placed upon my back so i will most likely cry in large amounts, thus needing love from you lovely friends! :) anyway summers like disapeared ..........but sadly most of you are happy about that. so you can go back to your lives..........

"event","hello . i'm severely stressed.

battery died at school. 3 hrs of sleep

i keep thinking back to when everything was so easy. i have no more patience.





new fact for a new day....

the new trend : girls that are now giving up on guys because ""they're assholes and don't understand women"" and are now claiming they're bi-sexual. not only read in a newspaper article which sort of was wild....but also heard from a friend...people are so desperate for love they decide to change their sexual preferrence....totally lame. whatever makes your heart beat.

what a weird day.


dear all of whitneys friends? i miss you."

RULES
# 1 from now on : Stop saying Brew. 
# 2 stop asking me what Brew means, I myself, have absolutely no clue as to what it means.
# 3 Boys will be Boys?
# 4 We're very inconsistent, it should probably stop.
and Lastly # 5 Teach the brother not to snore.

As we can see, I'm not as chipper as I was yesterday.  I reconsidered the Assistant Position. Mike thinks it's a great idea, and he really thought my ideas were going to go well.  Katy applied for the 50th time, hopefully her last. (She'll get it) Did anyone happen to see the Boston College Game? Tough loss. Sorry. But anyway, I really hate it how I can hang out with my friends for a whole whopping weekend, and then next week they totally disapear. It really sucks:(. ;lkdjsjfadj School is now back to bein just breezy. I don't do anything, but pay for useless classes.  While working 40 hours of work you get the same old customers right? There are some sad movie watchers out there. I have a gentleman come in every morning right at 10 am, and he talks to me like he hasn't seen me in months. Talk about old.  We have a very big meeting at work on Friday which I'm honestly nervous as hell about! Chris (District Manager) and various other ""Important People"" are surveying the store. I think I'll be fine as long as they don't ask to speak to me in the back again. haha. 

Okay,it's official I need to stop popping every fhorn string possible. It's almost a new hobby!


In other news, my cat lost 2 lbs. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only releaved one. 



Anyway, Goodbye February, Hello March."

"event","now that christmas is over, other things evolve.... let me begin with the major point of discussion involving my mother.  one who has always been a great mother over all but yet tries to take advantage of my heart.  i tell her every secret, knowing it will never escape...therefore i never have to worry about it spreading around. trust, i suppose. everyday is different in this house. one day i think im moving out into an apartment, the next i'm staying here for another year. i just don't understand why this trust must be half ass.  this all collides with the topic christmas.  most families/friends just hope for their loved ones are happy. they dont want the other to get them present.. in this case these tales are all MYTHS. after having one of i suppose the best christmas' i've ever had 1'am my mother happens to just say ""ya know whit, i really thought you were going to get us something for christmas."" that one thing that should have never been said.  how can you honestly look me in the eye and try to make me feel guilty.  ""this is your first job, i just hoped you would just get us a little something."" ""you're 
selfish"" meanwhile 1:30 am still crying...wishing this was all a dream......it kept going.  how can this so called trust, or better yet LOVE come to this?   this may not mean anything to any of you, but after feeling like the luckiest kid in the world, having something like that said to you totally crushes that wonderful feeling.  sometimes the pain tears bring never felt so good. and sometimes, i just wish i could go to you with problems like these.  

don't get me wrong, my christmas was fabulous, i know i got everything and more than anything i honestly needed. i am indeed greatful.
after all the Everything.........i'm just so glad i can run away from everything tomorrow. it's the only road in my non-existent neighborhood. i hope you all had a wonderful holiday.

"event","ok so today is the first real day of freshman camp. and what do i do? PASS OUT! no not really but pretty close, go figure right? like i went to bed a little after 12 because i couldnt sleep and i didnt get to really eat anything that much...so that wasnt a good morning to start off on. after that we finally had our break at 11:30 instead of 12 WHOA they actually have HEARTS! yeah so me lauren and this guy named jason walked to subway. then i accidently tapped this car in the parking lot of price...but i only got black rubber on my bumper and the other car had no damage. THANK GOD i almost cried. i was soooo scared bah but yeah so now i just got back and laurens takin a shower then her room mate is coming to drop off some things also to discover laurens very bright and girly side of the room. she might kill lauren. but i think its cute, it definately suits her. i forgot that we had a music rehearsal this afternoon as well, that was actually fun because im not too shabby on tuba. yay. so we did that for a while..and now im just waitin to take a shower then im going to ""the sousa"" party but im slightly frightened. theyre bringing cigars and boy things. im probably going to be playing with like the curtains or something. who knows, too bad thats all my section talked about today DONT FORGET WE'RE GETTING BEER TONIGHT GUYS!!

"event","I'm so confused on how to react to people now...it's weird how my emotions have been the past few months. I'm really starting to understand that people are treating me now like an adult, and I just miss being a kid. I know I can still do stupid and retarded stuff but it's just weird now and I really don't like all the responsibilities that go with the title. I keep saying I don't know who my real friends are, and I really don't. People can change just like that and it's already hit me. I've already been up and down hill with friendships.......it's just so hard to sit there and pretend like everythings okay because I know it's not. Heck, I'm not even going to a Universtiy right now an everyone else is flippin out..I don't want to lose the few friends I do have. Just scared I guess, but it's just normal. But when my ""best friend"" leaves for like a   month or better yet a year how am I supposed to let go like that...??? I'm very weak when it comes to saying goodbye but I guess everyone is right? anyway on to happier things! I've been driving a lot lately, definately getting the feel for the car. I think I made a good decision by practicing more with my parents, I'm actually a lot more aware of everything surrounding me. which is GREAT! haha the cars great I'm getting the window fixed on Tuesday (ThankGOD) and we're putting the new windshield wipers on soon too. New headlights coming as well! they're all fogged up now *yuck* so lifes not too darn bad! I made this deal w/ kat regarding guitars although I feel horrible about not really doing MY DEAL I suppose she's happy w/ what she decided on. I'm happy too..I would never give up an opportunity to pick up another instrument for the house :). I started drinking more fluids lately, and boy can I feel the difference....I've been peeing like every 5 seconds, it's good for you though! Gonna start going back to the gym a few times a week just to shapen up a little and just have fun with the rest of my summer....Gotta head off to Wake Tech in a while to get my books because I start school in less than a month! (yikes) but until then like I said I will be busy having a great summer soooooo have a happy week! :)

Overall one small negative detail brought my whole week into the shitters. I keep getting told to get over it, but I'm too serious when it comes to my friends. I'm trying to be different, or rather change my ways in life so I won't be shat on anymore. I miss football, and I miss just being stupid with my friends :( everyone is changing and I don't like it. They're all leaving me in about 3 months :("

"event","Today I went to my grandparents house in Raleigh. It was cool because my grandpa was talking to me a lot and he told me that he was going to give me his cornet. I was like so astonished because he always talks about how much he loved making music, and he told me he wanted me to have it because he wants to continue to be involved with music. I think it's awesome. My whole family was like all over me because I really haven't seen them since Christmas and they all said I looked really good and that they're very proud of how far I've come. It was kinda weird because they were talking about graduation like for a while and they're all really excited about it...I was just kind of agreeing to everything they said..haha. It was good to see them.

Then my dad brother and I went to Crossroads when I finally got the stupid suit! Then bought other stuff that I still needed and bought more clothes at Old Navy. I'm Happy!

After that I get a phone call from Alyssa saying she needs me to be at the Church now because Chris didn't have anyone to run the Sounds and Slides. So I'm like well I don't think I can because I'm supposed to be going to dinner with my parents. But instead my dad sped to Apex I ran to the CLC. Turns out they didn't need me. AH!!!! I hate it when he does that! I'm like seriously you could have called me! So then of course I can't leave.....but whatever it was actually really fun tonight because we were talking about how people should love others more than thinking about ourselves first. I got a warm fuzzy because I loved a person! haha mmm but yeah I had a good day.

Thanks jana for hangin with me lately, like seriously you're the only one that has listened to me when I had a problem and I appreciate that.  Plus I think I learned a lot about tires today. haha but you know it was fun. life is life and i'm just a kid hoping to actually be something when I grow up. I have so much to look forward to, and I really hope that I do well these next 5 years...they're really important to me. anyways, a typical update among people that I converse with: well it's really the same because everyone is still busy with there boyfriends or girlfriends but I mean I think that I'm sorta happy about being in the position that I am, because I have learned more than I would have ever thought just from my friends relationships. to tell you the truth, I honestly don't really try to impress anyone, and I don't think that's a bad thing..so I guess I think I like the way I'm living right now."

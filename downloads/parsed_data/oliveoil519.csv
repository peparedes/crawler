"event","my evening began when i had my soccer game, and forot to bring shorts to wear under my white uniform shorts. we won 7-1 and i again scored 3 goals. sara scored 2 and nikki scored 1. we are good. then nikki, shillvonne, sara, and i went to bk and got some crowns and dinner. then we went to my house and my mommy bought cake. it was great. after they left, stephany called to wish me a happy birthday and then we caught eachother up with what was going on and stuff. 5 minutes into the convo and baker called. i was a little suprised and i was sad that i didn't get to talk to him for a long time b.c i was on the other line with stephany. so hopefully he will call back tonight because i miss talking to him. and last night was great, at the soccer game i put back on my dickies, i got new ones for my b-day and they are huge, it's great. and i was sagging them and i pulled the pockets out in the back and got my pimp limp on...omg. that was hilarious. carol was being carol and that was funny too. today i came to school happy and i still am. andrew let me wear his glow in the dark bracelet that says ""kids on the glow"" it is great. but its too small for my wrist so we had to put it on my ankle. i feel bad that i smacked his head. tear. and then nick wrote me a note and it was like, i heard you like andrew. omg nick i swear he is pissing me off so bad b.c he is annoying and very conceited. i mean and cocky too. that is awful but o well. i had to write somem dumb essay in english today. BORING. it is so muggy right now. practice today. and i will see jason at lunch i think o yea he is so hot. i cannot stop thinking about him. stephanie and i had fun before the game yesterday also, but we didn't spend that much tim together, its hard to explain."

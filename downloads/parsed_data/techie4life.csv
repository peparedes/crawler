"event","Shit hit the fan this past weekend.
Life is sucking.
Life sucks less because of good friends.
Life wouldn't suck in first place if we were still together.
Life sucks more at night.
Trying to ward off lonelyness.
Trying to think of reasons to live.
I can think of many.
None of them help ease the pain.
I'm just waiting.
Waiting for time to pass...
and to ""heal all wounds""."

Yeah, so I really hope that we still have beautiful Alaska to enjoy after the next four years and I hope the entire world doesn't hate us by the end of the next four years. I'm also hoping that Bush gains a few IQ points soon...I don't know if I can take another four years of the guy who put the ""duh"" in democracy.

RAVE: Yey to my Mom for teaching Excel to me last night. I didn't pay attention last week in Comp. Lit., so I had no idea how to use it. So she helped me with a project last night and my parents fed me yummy dinner too. Can't beat that.

RANT: Comp. Lit. class which is the most boring class ever created in the history of human kind. I'm about to take another three hours out of my life to listen to some prof mumble about how to use powerpoint. Snore.

Plus Zack Braff is hot. Anywho...I worked this morning and it was really slow. There were a lot of empty beds at the hospital, which I guess is a good thing, but it made my job too easy. I did some homework during my shift, which I always feel guilty about, but my trainer said it was ok to do. So then I came home and took an hour nap because I didn't sleep very well last night...proabably because I took a nap yesterday too. I need to stop taking naps. I like sleeping though because I can't feel anything when I'm sleeping...like lonelyness or sadness. I've been better I guess...still numb. I do fine on the weekends, generally.  Sometimes I sit at home and cry on Saturday night because it seems like everyone has someone but me. But the week can be stressful. I do my very best to aviod you-know-who, but sometimes he's not in class when he should be and I run into him sitting in the lobby, and I have a full blown panic attack. I get really sick to my stomach and dizzy and start shaking.  It sucks. I just want someone else...even if it's just a friend with benefits. Anything to help me move on. I would even take a rebound relationship. Something. Anyway, so that's what's going on with me. If anyone knows any single guys that they think I might like, drop me a line."

First he told me he had a date with some girl from fencing. My heart plunged into my stomach. Then he said that he's a ""firm beleiver that when a couple breaks up, it's for good."" So then my stomach fell from my stomach to my feet.  He realized that after he ""lost the relationship"" that he was working too much, so he went to his boss and asked for less hours.  Why he couldn't do that before is beyond me.  All I know is that I'm in computer class and I'm about to have a breakdown. I just don't get it.

The prof doesn't respond to her e-mails and the directions for the assignments are really ambiguous. My roomate, my boyfriend, my friend Walter and myself all got 10 out of 50 points for the first assignment because we didn't know what she meant by ""director's perspective"". I emailed her asking her about it, but she never responded. Now she's given us a quiz that has imposibly detailed questions and only 25 minutes to take it. and if we go over the 25 minutes, she subtracts 4 points for each minute. Both my roomate and I are pissed about this class and we're going on Monday to our theatre advisor to complain. I might end up withdrawing from the class and taking it with someone else next year."

So I was still kind of bummed, so I left the FAC early and went over to the SRC to work out. I thought maybe I would feel more energized after I worked out, but now I just feel kind of sick. I'm a little light-headed and really tired. So now I'm in the computer commons waiting for 3:00 to come around so I can go to my religions class. After that gets out at 4:30, I'll probably get to my car around 5pm and get home around 6:00. Yes, an hour to get from ASU to my apartment.

Every other day this guy goes around the apartment complex (or at least this part of it) at around 6:30, 7:00 am and blows all the pine needles and twigs out of the road onto the grass next to the parking lot. Ok, first of all, who gives a rat's ass if there are tiny twigs and dead pine needles in the parking lot? Second, this is monsoon season, which means every other day there is either a storm or gusty winds that blows everything back into the parking lot again. I just think it is THE most pointless activity. It's loud, it's early and it's like spiting in the ocean. 
Leaf blowers are the most useless invention ever!!!

Sean surprized me with flowers yesterday morning.  I was sitting here updating my livejournal and he called to arrange a time to come over and pick me up for lunch. Atlas started barking, so I told him to shut up and let him out of my room so he could go see that there wasn't anyone at the door. But when I opened my door, Sean was standing there holding a bouquet of flowers and grinning! I was so surprized and delighted. I love flowers...and he brought me Reese's Swoops candy...which I've already ate a third of. He waited for me to shower and get dressed and primp before taking me out to lunch at Streets of New York. :)Yumm!

Now in Atlas' defense, he's a dog and if he feels threatened, he'll try to defend himself.  I think Sean just caught Atlas off gaurd and scared him, so that's why he bit.  Sean threatened to ""strangle that dog"" if I didn't get him out of the room right away.  This upset me a lot.  Sometimes Sean has a temper and it makes me wonder sometimes if he would ever hurt me.  I know he has a temper and sometimes needs to think about how he manages his anger.

But anyway, I just want school to start so I can a) see him more and b) feel like I have some purpose in life.  Right now, I could drop off the face of the earth and I really don't think anyone would notice."

Tomorrow is our Tech day, so I don't get to see him tomorrow either.  My friend Mindy is flying in tomorrow and I feel bad because I won't be around much to hang out with her.  Then next Wednesday is our five month anniversary, and Sean has a show that night till 11pm.  Then he has a show the next day too.  Friday the 20th is his birthday, but he's working on his birthday and my show has it's final dress rehearsal then opens that night, so I won't be spending much time with Sean on his birthday either.  I'm super stressed out, and ended up crying in to Sean's shoulder today at a restaurant.  Public breakdowns are really embarrassing.  So today, overall, sucked ass.  Hopefully, my life will get better and less stressed soon."

We have to share half of our cast with Cherry Orchard - the play we are in rep with.  The director of Cherry Orchard is a real ass and he takes it out on everyone, whether their part of the production or not.  But we have very strong actors and a strong production crew, so I know we'll make it.  Our director for Fifth of July is really great. He's a hundred times better than Cherry Orchard's director.  Anyway, we're getting down to crunch time, so the next few weeks should be interesting."

I must have caught something on the plane, because I had a bad head cold for a few days.  I didn't want to miss the festivities of ringing in the New Year, so I pumped my body full of Dayquil and orange juice and spent New Year's Eve with Sean.  We went to his friend's house for a couple hours then headed over to the big party that Tempe throws every year.  It was basically 150,000 people stumbling around Mill Avenue drunk.  I had fun though because this was the first year I've had someone to kiss at midnight, and I definetly celebrated that.  Sean and I ""MILLed"" around (hehe...pun intended) until 11:00 when we decided to grab two hot dogs and park our butts next to Tempe Town Lake.  We listened to the band Live and ate our hot dogs until midnight, when we rang in the New Year with a kiss while fire works went off above us.  Ooooh, how romantic is that?! We watched the fireworks, then made the trek back to the car and Sean dropped me off at home around 1 am.  Overall, an excellent way to welcome 2004!"

That's not what I mean to do.  Just give me time.  I know Sean has ""intruded"" into some of my friendships, but I'm working on it. Don't hate him because I think a lot about him or because I spend a lot of time around him. Anyone who has ever had a significant other knows where I'm coming from.

I know it sounds studid, but he's a huge part of my life and I love him very much.  Courtney warned me yesterday before I left Tempe that I need to start spending more time with other people besides Sean. She said, ""Lynn, we all love Sean, but you better be careful, because people are gonna start hating him if you spend too much time around him.  You need to hang out with your other friends too."" I thought that was a rather huge slap in the face.  I'll spend as much time with Sean as I want to.  I know what she's getting at, but Sean works a lot and I have a production going almost all the time, so we don't see each other as much as we'de like to anyway.  I still do stuff with my other friends, but if it's a choice between hanging out with Sean or hanging out with my friends, you can probably guess which one I'm going to choose.  Anyway, I guess I'm just missing him a lot.  Today is our 2 month anniversary and he's not here with me.  Sigh...I will enjoy my time here in Wheaton. I love my family, so I'm very glad to see them.  This will be the last or second to last time I come back here.  I'm ready to let go of this town and the house I grew up in.  Tempe is my home and I've known that for quite some time."

He sounded less than pleased.  I said, ""yeah...ummm..well...I don't want to get you in trouble...so I'll talk to you later..."" He's like, ""I'll call you when I get off at 9:45.""

He might want to be a cop, or an actor, or...anything.  He's really into outdoor stuff.  For out first date we went rock climbing. It was awesome.  On the weekends, he works as a white water rafting guide on the Salt River.  Anywho, he's a really great guy...one of the few INTERESTING guys left on the earth.  It seemed like all guys only watched tv and played PS2 in their free time.  But, I was proved wrong!  We've only been dating for a week, but we've been friends since the beginning of the semester.

"event","Hi ya'll.  I got back from Laramie on Monday morning around 6 am and slept all day.  It was definitly an experience I will never forget.  The residents of Laramie I think are forced to be tolerant now.  But they ARE tolerant now.  Everyone we talked to there ways it's so much better than it used to be.  We visited the cemetery in Casper, WY, The Fireside Bar, the University of Wyoming campus, and the fence where Matthew Shepard died.  That part of the fence was taken down shortly after the crime by the land owners, which makes me glad.  Part of the fence is still there.  It's a buck fence and it was chilling just seeing that part up close.  If you got a group of ten people to scream at the top of their lungs while standing there by the fence, no one would hear you.  That's how isolated it is.  Downtown Laramie reminds me of Wheaton.  Old store fronts and turn of the century buildings.  Laramie is 27,000 and Wheaton is about 53,000.  It was an incredible experience that I will never ever forget.  Special thanks to Brian and Eric who brought me the opportunity to go with them on this very emotional journey."

It's all I ate, drank, slept and...(yeah, fill in the blank) for the past month and a half.  It was extreamly stressful and strenuous, and I would do it again in a heartbeat...because I love theatre.  

The experience of The Laramie Project production has moved me to join two wonderful people on a 17 hour plus road trip.  I was offered the opportunity to go to Laramie, Wyoming with two members of the LGBTQ.  These two men are going to Laramie to pay their respects to Matthew Shepard in the form of a vigil.  I jumped at the opportunity, and after meeting the guys, I decided I definetly wanted to go.  Sooo...on October 9th, I will be driving in this group to Laramie...about a 17 hour drive.  I plan on journaling (in my actual paper journal) and taking pictures along this journey.  If anyone is interested in hearing more about my trip when I get back, please e-mail me at LvThe50s44@aol.com.

I feel this is one of the most important trips I will ever take in my life, and to share it with all of you would make it that much more incredible."

I got there and I seriously thought it was a cruel joke someone on Hanson.net was playing on me.  So I go up to their tour manager, Micah, and was like, ""Lynn Sparber?...I'm supposed to have a meet and greet?..""  He's like, ""Lynn...Lynn...Oh, yep! Lynn! Here ya go!"" and he handed me a VIP pass.  I was like, ""Holy shit!  It wasn't a cruel joke!""  Then I waited with the other Hanson.net-ers in the 100 degree heat until we were taken to the back door around 6:45.  They had us line up outside the backstage area until the guys were ready. 

Then they opened the door and I saw them just standing there.  The first thing I thought was, ""Wow.  They actually LOOK like Hanson!""  Funny, I know.  Anyway, I was the second person to meet them and I shook all their hands.  Ike has really big, soft hands and Zac and Taylor's hands are rough since they both play drums.  They're all really nice guys, really genuine.  Taylor is way taller than I thought he would be. (My picture with them is at the top of this page!) 

After everone had met them, we were ushered into a back room to wait for the doors to open to the rest of the audience.  I got up at the front near Zac.  I was right behind the barrier, so no one was in front of me.  The concert was unbeleivable.  They were so good.  They still sound awesome...I had the time of my life jumping up and down, clapping, singing and laughing with the other fans.  After the concert, Courtney and Margo left, but I stayed behind because I had driven there by myself and I wanted to see them get on the bus.

We stood outside for about fifteen minutes before Zac came out.  He went to the other side of the fence to sign autographs.  Then Natalie came out of the venue with Ezra in her arms and walked to the bus.  She waved at us and got on the bus.  She came out a few minutes later to come over and say hi.  She's sooooo pretty and totally down to earth.  She's so nice and really humble even though she's married to this big rock star.  She went back to the bus and Taylor came out a few minutes later to say hi and sign a few autographs.  He signed my CD!  He looked so good.  All I kept thinking was, ""I can't beleive Taylor Hanson is standing right in front of me"".  Walker came up behind him and said that they had to get going.  Tay signed a few more CDs and left for the bus.  

I stood in the parking lot for about 15 minutes more and watched as Zac played with Ezra on the bus.  Then the bus pulled away and I woke up! Just kidding, it was real!  A bunch of fans, including myself, went to Denny's and talked and laughed about our experience.  I got home around 1:30 and didn't fall asleep until around 2:15.  

But I wasn't tired the next day because I was still on that natural adrenaline high from the meet and greet and the concert. I'm still on that high now!

If you're a Hanson fan, awesome.  If you're not, check them out.  Most people haven't heard anything of theirs since the 1997 days of MMMBOP.  How much does a band change in eight years?  A hella lot.  I would describe their sound no as a combination of Coldplay and Dave Matthews Band with a little Blues Traveler mixed in.  They've outlasted most bands that got big in '97, so they must be doing something right!  Anyway, have an open mind, and go check 'em out!

"event","The lament of the bargain shopper

by Rachel Elizabeth Veronica Filippazzo and Kelcy Thompson-Tuttle Green

its both as simple and subtle as blunt force trauma
lines crossed by word of mouth upon the leather couch
seedy and worthless from wasted youth, potential, and time
glossy and red, lips part as dark clouds fill the skies
dullards, dreamers, whores, and lovers, all lambs in fox hide
transparent and empty are lies, as smoke filled words billow
sweet fruit of revolution wrapped in celophane, fall hard on split cement
rotten and disgusting though prepackaged, moldy self loathing drips
black bars on wombs sold in an aisle of pleasant appeasement
behind glass as usual, you claw their backs in mock pleasure
oh holy price check, six souls for just a dime
until sunday good man, a day for rest, and worship you wait
while your restraint breaks and shatters you sob
antiseptic tears clean even the most lived in of our stains
you cling to the bits of flesh underneath your manicured fingernails
because in the end its all we can ever hope to be
polished and washed, thoroughly scrubbed vessels of former substance
ressurected in ashtrays, dirty bathroom stalls, and department stores
baptised in chanel, and clothed in robes with purple labels
champagne holds the shape of the container it flows into
and so does blood, bubbling and sick
there is no shape with out substance
just impermanence, and cohersion
as you tip the bottle, emptying your worthless self into every endevor
your limp corpse lying skewed on italian cows
lain out to dry, and stretched like your skin over your insides
veneers dress up but don't make the lies any more believable
and the price you pay is never enough
no tongue holds a term for pilgrim in a paved land
the bags under your eyes are not vuitton
but you lift the lids, and carry on
every place the same"

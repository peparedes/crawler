"event","woohoo i did mile REPEATS  and here i am alive to tell about it. the last vo2 max workout thank god... yea these nike freezes kinda hurt? dunno wuts up with that... seriously considering buying spikes.

iced the leg for some more today its feeling better :) started acting up during practice, but i'm hoping its lactic acid buildup or maybe a pulled muscle. random cuts?? maybe i was to close to someone today, those spikes are dangerous. or some pebbles kicked up? iono its a mystery. i'm loving every second of this torture though. well maybe just the aftermath ;) but its worth it i think.

had a good day in school, finally switching outta geckle's class (i hope) something i should have done a lonnnggg time ago, please let that be warning to anyone who gets him... i didn't listen to other people's warnings and here i am.

resolved a slight problem, but as small as it is it helps. little things really do help. 

oh yeah and discovered that there is a civilization that was just recently uncovered. pretty interesting, makes me feel ignorant and kind of excited :) i really need to watch the news instead of cartoons lol (jkjk)

though all of this is really good, i feel kinda helpless, like i'm letting someone down. my dad actually. i tried so hard this year, harder than any other, and the only thing paying off is c.c. iono what i'm going to do... try harder, i've even considered quitting the team but what would that accomplish? and maybe that makes me a worse person because somehow this year i actually matter to the team? maybe? a little? enough to send me on a guilt trip...

god i can't wait for this weekend :)
at least there are amazing friends out there who make life worth living

one last thing

i'm GETTING A CHOCOLATE LAB!!! puppy. names would be really good if you have any... not that people read this anyway :) but who knows"

"event","okay this week was just really really REALLY good!!! except for what happened like an hour ago hehe... apparently i'm a sucky babysitter- but what can i say??? jocelyn has the cutest puppy face ever how do i say NO? w/e i'll just have to tighten it up a notch and no more brownies... that means letting her have like UNDER 5 brownies next time i babysit... yea that'd be a good idea.

anywayyys thursday i went to the football game and then we all hung out at lowos. i officially SUCK at football but enjoy watching people who actually care run their asses off playing it :) and then a couple of interesting things happened... wink wink erika.

then i couldn't sleep at all last nite being soo nervous i thought i was puke. i woke up and got ready for hell at the franklin park invitational and i didn't do too damn bad. i really surprised myself and that really really helped me alot and i felt like on top of the world all day :).

yea those were the major events... besides the fact that i've actually resolved a really bad fight with the rents which just makes me feel alot better... sometimes i feel like if i want something done i really can't count on anyone except myself. thats common sense though i guess but hey i learn each day right?

lastly the best event is that i'm realizing whose scum and whose worth while. meaning friends and people who i wish were more than that. its pretty funny how seriously we take high school and in a while we'll just be looking back like whoa i thought this of them and i wore that and i tried to fit in with who? it'll be hilarious... not that any of that applies to anyone. wow i'm tired i don't even know if i'm making sense anymore!

but yeah there's some really cool people out there... and i'm learning alot about them. some people may come off as asses when maybe their just shy and a little overprotective and in reality they're just really cool if you take the time to see beyond that and talk to them. and there's a couple of things that are in the past that i never knew... and it just explains a whole lot.


ahh today was such a good day!!!"

"event","Today was really really nice. Last night all the girls came over and we pigged out and screamed loud enough to break all the windows in my house. (we saw the ring 2 lol.) We also did some other fun things which I'm not gonna talk about ;)... it was just awesome to see everyone.

I just hung out and tomorrow I might go to Boston with Dunya and Steph if I have enough time. I feel like I'm so tired though. I really wanna go though, I realized that I'm such a little girl. There's innocent, and then theres naive. I think maybe thats what I'm becoming :( modesty, and shyness are just traits but at some point I just want to push myself. I rely on my friend to do that for me and I need to quit it. When I actually DO try to speak up my words come out bitchy, or just stupid and jumbled. I mean on Friday I think maybe I could have done the Town Forest but I was too chicken. And last night I sounded like a mother (certain people know what I mean lol.) In one word, I'm way overprotective.

I'm gonna set aside everything, and everyone else in my head and focus on me. This is something I'm gonna work on :) and although I sound like a hippy right now, I don't really care.

I wonder if time can really heal all wounds. I think its really weird how your heart can ""ache"" because how does that happen? I don't get it. Right now just think about everything thats important to you, and make sure you pay your respects. You never know when you might lose one of them.

Tomorrow will be better..."

"event","ughhh i hate things i can't have. especially when these things would just be completley ruined, if you had them... its just kinda like one of those plastic superhero figurines in the 40 year old virgin- once you take it out of the box it loses all its value. kinda like that.

i guess its just that...what i want is so perfect without me that i can't have it because if i did it i would just ruin it.

i miss my puppy :( i miss my home. this neighborhood is fantastic... i can't complain i mean its beautiful, the people are wonderful, the house is perfect. but my HOME is at 57 washington street where you can walk outside in your pj's not caring what you look like and wave to your equally crappy looking neighbor whose outside grabbing the morning paper in her pj's! and where the house is beautiful, and ancient, and flawed. and where your feet actually get DIRTY when you walk down the driveway, and everyone is down to earth and real and the people are mixed, and just different, there's elderly people, people going through hard times, TOTALLY INSANE people probably willing to sell you drugs, the weird but kind lady with a million pets, the natick outdoor store, downtown, the black lab next to listen up, the ""SABBATH RULES"" sign spraypainted on the back of that alley in red, the people who allow you into powers even though your underage and give you candy, jones, downtown, parkstreet...

civilization... :(

i'm in a suburbian prison, and my brother is gone, and my dog is gone, and its lonely, and i sound like a whiny brat, and all those blonde moms with big SUVS and rich hubbys ask me in polite voices what i think of my new house because they all love it, and i reply in an expected tone: ""its nice."" when its not. and its selifish that i'm going on about it like this.

i'm going to do some more hw and then maybe i'll look online at some more dogs for adoption...

please don't respond to this okay?"

"event","I'm at Tori's house :) we're in the computer room where there are two computers (wow that was such a good idea). I went to her summer house in Mattapoisette for the weekend where we basically just hung out and watched tv until this morning when we decided to go sailing with her brother Andy, Greg, and Doug Herring. That was interesting, I had fun though. Now we're back at Tori's place (""doing spanish homework"" lol) and we're waiting until like 7 when we're going with Tori's dad to see the 40 year old virgin. I remember the last time I was at the movies this old guy in front of me was like: ""yea one ticket to the virgin guy whose over 40."" I was like WHHHHATTT come on at least get the name right! Its so stupid the movie theater's method of thinking... I mean we teens at least KNOW whats going on with movies and yet we're restricted??? While we have the physco adults roaming free to watch whatever the heck they want, and only doing so because they can. Not even CARING about the important things that make up a movie, like brick for instance, or napolean. I mean important figures in history like that. Okay well if any of what I said actually made sense then somebody let me know.

I can't believe we're sophmores! Its great :) this year better be fun... can somebody please have a damn houseparty already I mean come ON...

Oh yeah and one more thing...
what is the deal with community seminars? I'd just like to hear stories...some are quite amusing."

tori called earlier and told me that when i get back maybe she and lowos will meet me at the airport which would just be amazing and uncalled for lol and it felt great to be missed :)

right now i'm just kinda around...watching the real world and thinking about stuff. i saw the episode of degrassi that wasn't allowed to air in the states on alisa's comp where manny gets an abortion! it was pretty sad. i think i have the link for ppl who care?

i'm getting really nervous about next year but at the same time i'm honestly kinda excited lol. (yes i know its nerdy!) its just that i wanna see everyone and also being a sophmore is just gonna be awesome. i wanna have a party. like right before the end of august, but thing is everyones so busy with their summer vaca schedules and crap that its hard working around schedules.

"event","Hawaii was fun, we did all the usual stuff that tourists do... lava sites, dolphins, lua-aus or however they're spelled. alot of asians there, plus hawaiians are similar to asians lol so i was like right at home. the towel boys are very nice ;) but my FAVORITE thing was snorkeling- you haven't lived till u do it, the bodyglove (boat name) is the coolest boat and the top floor has a slide that goes into the ocean as well as an area where you can just jump right off the side of the boat. it was so scary but really fun and there was this guy there (a college teacher) who was Napolean Dyamite's twin he even spoke just like him, he was like dude the slide off this thing is sweet. and i was like have you seen napolean dynamite? and hes like man don't tell me i remind you of him because everyone says that and its NOT a compliment. haha.

anywaaaays sat next to this kid tim on the plane ride home he was like the smartest fricking person, he was in hawaii for this math competition, and he's in all A.P classes, plus he volunteers and helps out stupid kids with math.

now i'm here in seattle, with alisa's family acting like an idiot and talking baby talk to her gorgeous little brother andrew/andrea (english,russian names) and i changed the first poopy diaper in my whole life and i'm DEFINITLEY going to do it again on account of alisa ditching me tomorrow so she can do community service at this place that i am never going to again lol.

yea i'm so homesick i thought i never would be but here i am whining lol... i miss everybody so much!!! alot of shit hit the fan this week :( alotttt like an unbelievable, scarring amount of shit.

sometimes stuff just happens that you don't expect, obviously. but i mean if it happens we should just try and take something from it. and also, we should know that whenever your feeling crappy theres always  somebody you can lean on and if you don't have anybody theres always me :) (haha cuz i'm nobody, get it? jk)

well, goodnite guys

then after steph n meese finished exams they came over and we hung out downtown. we went to george's and pizza market since steph and i like pizza market more cuz its BETTER! and saw mike pogarian, emily, steph west, maria, and some other ppl... it was nice. then i SMACKED my leg against a wooden sign in the road being the idiot that i am lol. i have a huge bruise its really  gross but it doesnt hurt which is good. an downtown we saw these amazingly cute dogs in this store and we ran in and pet them it was sooo cute... then we went to honeyfarms and the scary roadworkers checked us out or dunya anyways ;) and so we went home and pigged out while watching the scariest movie ever darkness.

mr. bradford's room is unusually hot and humid which makes this period fly by ever so fast :) but luckily i have my notes to keep me going lol. yup allie dared me to write a note to every single person in this class so i wrote: have a great day. -notegirl on all these little slips of paper and handed them out to people even mr.bradford. they all thought i was a physco but they didnt really care. it was interesting-

sooo today after school i rush home and pack 3 days worth of clothing in a backpack so i can go down to westport to stay at my summer house for the weekend. (tori i'm so sorry i'm missing the block party with you and jordann!) and that'll be fun i hope... i can't wait to just go to swimming at the beach!

today is pretty easy so far... came in kinda late since this morning i kept looking for my sandals and i eventually missed the bus lol, so mr.levy was like nicole go get a tardy pass. so then i did and i kinda skipped class too. i was wondering around looking for a water fountain but didn't find one, and i saw mrs.goodWING (haha as erika mispronounces it)and then i just kinda walked REALLLLLY really slow back to class and erika and i spent class drawing pictures. and i got my test back which i thought i failed but NOPE A baby it was good! tori is here and she is checking all of my spelling!! HEY GUYS!!!!- <3 TORI!!

THEN had a lovely sleepover with tori and allie where we watched shrek 2, and played video games, and also tortured my poor baby sylvester.

and on saturday afternoon i spent the whole day with erika in boston and little italy picking up decorations, getting nails done, and getting dress measurements and then eating at this awesome resteraunt until 12:00!

then today at like 6:30 my mom says get up and get ready for erika, and i did and then we spent the WHOLE afternoon in a salon in boston getting hair done with ketty, myriam, and angelina sum of the funniest, nicest girls i've ever met :) and we had good times being a gang and attacking people with our hair, and they were especially good ""spanish dance"" teachers... although I don't think I danced the way they wanted me to but I tried! then we went to the great hall and spent all day decorating until the night of the party came :) i was sooo frigging nervous especially wen they said nicole HU... nice one...

but i walked out and waited and ate and laughed and danced and it was great :) and erika who looked like a gorgeous princess had the time of her life

and i am EXHAUSTED and bored and possibly skipping school tomorrow since its been 2 nights in a row that i've gone to bed at midnight and i'm just beat..."

All they cause is pain. Even though I haven't had a relationship, it still hurts ME to see what my friends go through for boys. Maybe thats why all I've ever done is admire from a distance. And I guess its staying that way."

We have the wannabe ghetto rich white kids from Kennedy, and according to what I've heard the unbelievably slutty freshman from Wilson. Great mix right there. Just a reminder to all those people who forgot about that lovely next generation: enjoy this while you can. People can say crap about us freshman all they want, but in reality I think I'll be jealous of next year's freshman. Being a freshman is great- its new, scary, exciting, theres new faces, the schools huge, people who you haven't seen in 4 years have grown up to be amazingly gorgeous...

I guess I'll just miss it.

"event","Hmm today was a normal day. Rolled out of bed, got ready and sat my ass in a chair while listening to the wonderful speech about how tomorrow is MCAS day for my favorite subject...drumroll...physics. Nice and early in the morning too. Well, at least I'll be missing class and I won't have to pass in  that stupid magnet lab that was due forever ago.

Where's summer? I need summer. Then again...summer means new freshman.
Wow I just keep getting more positive don't I?"

"event","Tori's sleepover was great as expected! It was kinda funny since half the crew couldn't make it cuz it was of such short notice but it was still fun. It was just Stephy, Tori, Molly and I, and to describe it in one word, we were INSANE. First we played laser tag in the dark of Tori's basement with little styrofoam pellets that actually hurt. It was the best, even though we like broke all the guns while playing (haha wow I got so into that game). 

Then we took a looong walk outside with flashlights and our big black umbrellas (because SUPPOSEDLY it was rainy...yea right) and we were talking in British accents to these random people we kept walking by. THENNN we read the funnies and played James Bond (well actually, I played James Bond all alone) and monopoly. Then we had ICECREAM and got hyper and played some more tag in the basement until we got tired and finished the night off watching Bridget Jone's Diary 2 (except Stephy and I fell asleep wicked early because we're nerdy like that).

When I finally got home, I didn't have time to take a shower because of Open House. It pissed me off cuz in the first place I don't want to move, and in the second place I don't even need to! My house is beautiful and I love it and the thought of anybody else taking it from me is just really...bad. But, being paranoid as I am, I planted a camera and I just finished watching the footage. Surprise surprise, 85% of the people viewing the house were nosy neighbors with absolutley no intention of buying.

Currently, life sucks."

"event","Lowos and I went to the Lilja fair around 1, and we lasted oh...about...20 minutes. Then we left. But before we did, we bumped into a couple of people and we didn't feel AS immature as we did in the first place. We saw, Jess Mcshane, Katie Cobb, Steph Clark, and Alby! It was interesting... it was like yea if your a loser with nothing to do then meet us at the lilja fair! Just kidding..

Then we walked down to tillies, and sort of went to a yard sale but chickened out hehe. Then we bought a huge bag of skittles and Eenie Weenie American Jellybeans (yea the company definitley needs to rename those...) it was great. Then we went home and helped me create a brand new livejournal for all the world to see! yay me... now we're going for a walk and we'll be back later :)

Tonight we're going to a sleepover @ tori's place! We're hoping everyone can make it, and if they can't then I guess threes a party? OH I'M SORRY, Lowos says twos a party and threes a BASH and that I need to get it right. (Smacks me on the head) Jkjk.

So later for now, wow I'm becoming obsessed with this thing just like lowos lol... this is bad!"

"event","i had arrangements for her that fell through recently and am looking for someone to take my uber awesome cat for the duration of our hike - we'll be gone for 3 months, but will be making our way back late june, early july depending on how quickly we finish.  she comes with a litter box, scratching post, cat food, litter, cat grass AND a catnip plant that she's a junkie for.  i also have a credit card specifically for her in the event she has to go to the vet.  it has enough on it for check-ups, or a deposit on any major work she hopefully won't need.  

she makes an awesome companion, is very vocal when she's hungry (so there's no confusion about what she's whining about), and is a total lap kitty.  she also sleeps a lot.  

i'm leaving in a week and i don't really want to drop her off at the shelter - at her age, they'll just euthanize her (she's almost 19).

if you can help, please email me at scarpetta80@yahoo.com."

"event","so jerri, previously from survivor, is looking for someone to do her website - thought i'd post this as it's fairly high-profile to anyone who wants the opportunity!

*********************************************************************

I'm currently looking for a website designer to help me get my site back up and running. I have all the old information, but want to make it look completely different than before with new pictures, information and such with some of the old re-posted (i.e. my photo gallery, news etc)

Don't need flash. HTML is perfectly fine.

Please contact me via this post through tribe.

Thanks,

"event","it's pretty crazy, but operation hike is coming up fast.  when the hike is done, we'll be coming back for a week or so to clean out the storage locker, but then we're off again, so i'm getting rid of big items earlier rather than later...like my piano.

i love this thing, i play it every day, but it's not realistic to store much less move across the country in a trailer, so it's gotta go.  i thought i'd give the opportunity to my friends first before I listed it on CL - 

it's a baldwin spinet (console) made in 1948.  if you haven't been to my house to see it in person, it's got a honey walnut varnish with ornate molding; all the ivory keys in tact.  i bought this from the original owner who's family obviously had it a long time.  it's in really good condition - only repair needed is a key that's going dead (middle G) and a tuning..  the piano looks much like <lj-cut text=""this:""> <img src=""http://www.allegromusiccentre.com/images/pianosale/baldwin.gif"" /> </lj-cut>

the fair market value is around $500 -  price is negotiable, so make me an offer!"

so i deleted my account - they've already given me a number of reasons to leave, but i was too lazy.  not anymore!  if you're on tribe, head's up that i'll be there instead: http://people.tribe.net/calamityjane"

"event","Every year Santa Barbara has this huge summer solstice festival in Alameda Park.  It's the one day when crews can bring their system, basically, and have a day party.  Locals crawl out of their Ethan and Allen hubs and Starbucks expresso fits to get freaky and it's something I wanna see.  well, that and all my crazy talented friends are spinning.

TCO, Word of Mouth and Justus Productions are throwing down on Saturday and Augs and I have procured a rental but have space for 2 more people.  We're leaving Friday night (6/20) and coming back Sunday early evening.  I got the rental cheap, but we'd split the cost of the car and gas equally.  This is a chance for you to see where I'm spending almost every waking weekend!  Let me know if you're interested in coming along (and not already going to several other campouts that weekend...).  Hickory is already holding a quiet and subtle grudge that I can't make rEvolution that same weekend (:P) but they fucked up my clone and I'd rather keep her chained up in the basement than let her loose into a magical forest with faeries and ravers."

Astral Productions and Sound of Mind Present...

People's Voice
A Journey Through Psychedelic Music - Friday, June 8th

People's voice is the first in a series of events designed to give you the chance to make your voice heard and suggest artists and DJ's you would like to hear play in SF.  The ultimate goal is to bring new and fresh talent into the scene, and create a musical journey throughout the night.

A core group of four DJs have teamed up together to bring this concept to life, but it relies on you to give us your input. This is essentially your event, so come out and let your voice be heard.

More info on how to give us your suggestions will be available at the event.

Your entertainment for the evening is:

Goldilox (Sleevin Records, www.djgoldilox.com) Goldilox has been playing underground parties for years, and is no stranger to the San Francisco electronic music scene.  She started out dropping crack house on vinyl, and now she has come a full 360 degrees and will be doing a fully digital mix.  Her set is not to be missed.

Kepi (Sound of Mind, kepiandkat.com, desertdwellers.org) Kepi has been opening for psytrance acts for years in SF, and keeps his tracks selections unique -  not scared of genres, he spins everything from downtempo to breaks to psytrance.  Thump Radio resident and a favorite when spinning outdoor desert gatherings including Moontribe gatherings outside of LA, Burning Man, and events in and around the West Coast and abroad.

Tandava (CCC)
From Goa to Greece, and from Portugal to London, Tandava has traveled the globe to seek out the freshest psytrance sounds to bring back to S.F. Well known by many local heads, he has thrilled the dance floors at Burning Man and underground parties for many years with his own style of stomping melodic morning sets.  Recently he and Sentient brought us Shane Gobi from Nano records at the outdoor &#65533;ReAwaken&#65533; gathering, and a wicked good time was had by all.  Boom!

Atum (Astral Productions)
Atum has been DJing psychedelic trance for over a decade. He has played alongside some of the best trance artists from around the world, and with his smooth mixing style has been known to rock the dance floor.

Sentient (Vaporvent Records)
Sentient has been blasting dancefloors with his groovy and infectious psytrance sound since 2001.  From Thump Radio resident to co-founder of the Synchronize weekly, from Burning Man to Brazil, his track selection and mixing skills cause crowds to explode.


Ambient Mafia Chillout Room:

Based out of San Francisco, The Ambient Mafia has been redefining chillroom culture since late 1999. Specializing in all things chill, The Mafia can be found hosting chillrooms at multiple-room club venues, massive warehouse events, one-offs, and underground events.

Downtempo, dub, midtempo, bossa nova, atmospheric drum n bass, IDM, underground hip hop, ambient: the Ambient Mafia DJs run the whole gamut of chill-out genres.  Times may change, but the Mafia mission remains the same - to give people music that makes them think, dance, and above all...chill.  More info can be found about the Ambient Mafia at www.ambientmafia.com

The Ambient Mafia crew will be in full force with:
Actual Rafiq
Olde Nasty
Peek
The Captain
Redstickman
Seventh Swami
Squelchy
We Are Not Pandas

Visuals by the one and only Doctor Spook!

my absolutely fantabulous familial crew Word of Mouth is throwing a day party this sunday. i know there's madness happening of all sorts in GGP, but we chose a spot away from the milling throng of kegger kids and police blocades to a more idyllic spot with one hell of a view. 

last year, we didn't have the best of outcomes with our last party, which was last June. it would have been my first time spinning with Word at that party, but the records I was going to play were stolen. Needless to say, after almost a year, we're finally raging ahead with a rediculous amount of ambition and passion to do what we set out to do - join people up from all walks of life, and showcase up and coming dj's of all styles in a free (and hopefully beautiful) locale. i'm going to give spinning with my fam another try since that June party and I'm packing some fierce sesame street anthems - any punk fools try to klep my stuff again, i'll have a good laugh this time. 

i hope to see you sunday - we'll be sporting good vibes and good music, bringing to you the following beat entrepreneurs: calamity jane, cumulus, djeeno, genji, itrev, and dj unagi. we're going from noon until 8pm - bring your bbq, your kids, your dog, pet sea monkey, whatever is your thing, and call 415-294-8535 from midnight saturday or check www.womsound.com for location and directions!"

and just when you think you've had enough chill, to kick off my birthday weekend the very next night, we have Ambient Mafia's happy hour at Mint Lounge, and we're making it pretty easy and chilled for you - not only is it free, but the drinks are cheap, talent is fresh, the locale is tight and it's actually for a good cause - we're raising money to cover Matt Jakes' wake. For each donation you contribute, we'll give you a cd of various Mafia mixes we burned just for this night. Regardless of how many things are going on this weekend, it'd mean a lot to show support to just a part of the family he left behind and toast up some memories :)

"event","no more rwb - no more camping, no more monthly gatherings..ralph closed the property to all business.

this place was the meeting ground for a community i've become very rooted in for the last 2 years, and it really was the heart and facilitator of some truly amazing times, discoveries, exploration, love, friendships, and even births of new beach folk (two friends became pregnant at the same time and both recently gave birth)... this whole thing makes me really sad. :(

i joined this group on tribe a while ago but never bothered to check it out really (they wouldn't stop sending me tribe invitations so i relented like a pussy).  yes, it's trance, but it's trance in TRANSYLVANIA, so it must be cool.  but would i ever get together the cash to go do this?  probably not.. just thought i'd throw this out in the event someone happens to be in vampire country this summer :)"

this lineup is insane.  if you're looking for something to do saturday, come to this.  lobudg is unbelievable, and when you feel an aneurysm coming on, head on over to the basket o chill ambient mafia is nurturing.

and then next saturday, i somehow got a gig in stockton.  i know nobody will make this because it is a bar in the middle of friggin nowhere, but i love this flyer - anybody who takes a photo of me holding a box of crayolas and puts it on a party flyer is a friend of mine and is worth posting:

"event","repost from Tribe:

As you all know, the brother of our dear friend Eva Kim, James, died tragically last week while making a heroic attempt to save his family trapped by severe weather and road conditions in the mountains of Southern Oregon. James is survived by his wife, Kati and two daughters, Penelope (4 years) and Sabine (7 months).

This Thursday, John Early and the EndUp will be donating the proceeds from the evening's festivities to a general college fund for the Kim daughters

In addition to your attendance, I would very much appreciate each of you passing the word of this event along to as many of your family members, friends and colleagues as possible. *ALL* proceeds collected at the door before 1 AM will be donated to the Kim Family, so please plan to arrive before 1 AM

Thu 12/14
The EndUp
401 6th Street @ Harrison
9:00 PM - 1:00 AM

:: Lineup ::
Dean Samaras
Ben Seagren Layne Loomis
Jeffery Allen
Chuck & Roll

If you can't make it out on Thursday, you can still donate to the James Kim Memorial Fund at:

"event","so me and some folk threw a party down in bayview on friday night.  yeah, i know - it's a shitty neighborhood.  whatever - people were watching cars to make sure nobody walked off with anybody's stuff when we were offloading (or i can assume), and the party was pretty much an all-out good time.  best turnout we've had, best vibe we've had...up until someone got pistol-whipped.  and then we shut the music off because augs said the cops were on their way.  and then i couldn't find my record bag.  turns out it still hasn't been found and it's now monday.  everything was cool - the kid got medical attention, the cops didn't end up busting us because we got out of there before they did another roll-through, but my records did a fucking houdini.

now, i want to vent because though my friends have the best intentions when they say 'oh, don't worry - you can make lemonade and start all over again!', it actually pisses me off.  no, i can't fucking make lemonade - i can't even make fucking tang with the records i have in my room.  the records in that case were EVERYTHING i had worked to assemble in sound and quality over the last 3 years.  and i don't want to talk too much shit about my crew because i love them to death, but i had hoped for a more urgent and fervent response to this, but nobody emailed a notice on our crew email list, and nobody to my knowledge really made a concerted effort to call everyone who packed up eq into their cars during strike either - and that's where i'm hoping it went; into someone's car.  maybe they were faded enough when they left to not notice a soft black technics case, because it's dark and it looks more like a man purse anyway.

i've seen dj's who's records were stolen receive a HUGE response in support, but for some fucking reason, everyone's blowing this off like it's no big thing.  i can't even begin to tell you how demeaning this whole experience has been - how the fuck can someone expect me to want to jump back on a horse that'll cost at least $600 to replace and not be paranoid that it won't happen again?  there's a certain momentum that is completely destroyed when your means of said momentum are swiped from you.  

tina - i'm going to give this a couple more days before i give up on looking for them.  after that, i'm going to rifle through some friend's collections and see if i can assemble a set that'll work with dina's music.  and btw - she hasn't returned my email, do you have a contact # for her?  

and with that - if anyone has any information who was at that party that might've seen something shady - please let me know.  any information will help..."

Oh, Rapebear quickly progresses past cows. Soon he's going after smaller, sexier bears, mountain goats, a schoolbus...

MR. X
He rapes a schoolbus?

ME
It's kind of the big setpiece of the film. He's thrusting through the windows, all the kids are screaming, he's making this ARRROOOOOOOOO noise...it's awesome.

MR. X
I'm sure. And the end? Do they stop Rapebear?

ME
Do they ever! See, there's this retarded kid named Gilbert Grape who keeps following Lance Bearworthy around for the entire movie. I figure you could cast either Steve Buscemi or maybe a real retard for the role. Anyway, Lance Bearworthy finally decides to strap sticks of dynamite to Gilbert's chest and sends him into Rapebear's cave...

"event","Today,is the annual Sexual Assault Yearly SpeakOut in Union Square Park.  If you have a chance between noon today and tomorrow to stop by and hear some of the stories I highly encourage it.  Sexual assault in New York City has actually increased this year and our culture is still pretty uneducated on the way rape affects women and society in general.

"event","Candace and I both have birthdays in the month of June so we thought it would be fun to go see Madonna at the Garden at the end of June to celebrate our birthdays together.  Neither of us really wanted a party and decided that the cheapest ticket price of $64.50 would be the same as a night out.  Plus considering Madonna's age of eleventy, we figured this may be one of her last tours before she breaks a hip or something.  So I got my credit card out and my computer booted up at 9am hoping to get any seats on any night for that price.  Alas, I have no tickets.  I could have sat in the 3rd promenade for $160 for a brief time between 9:05 - 9:07 but after that, nothing.  Very sad way to start out the week."

The link showing the sculpture is below but I'm its quite frightening so be prepared.

"event","Being in 2 book clubs was beginning to break the bank a bit (not to mention that there is no room left in my book shelf even after I cleaned it out and tried selling such fascinating titles as ""Great Jobs for Liberal Arts Majors"" on Half.com) so I decided to finally get a library card after living in NYC for almost 4 years.  Since I now have a limitless supply of books, I've made myself an ambitious reading list and am taking suggestions:
Eudora Welty: Selected Stories
Jane Austen: Pride and Predjudice
Leo Tolstoy: Anna Karennina 
Albert Camus: The Plague and The Stranger
Flannery O'Connor: Wise Blood
Kashio Ishiguro: Never Let Me Go
Cormac McCarthy: Blood Meridien
Graves: I, Claudius
Philip Roth: Portnoy's Complaint
Simone De Beauvoir: The Second Sex
Betty Friedan: The Feminine Mystique"

"event","Even though most people are saying the law will never really go into effect, I find it pretty disturbing that states such as South Dakota are banning abortion even in the case of RAPE AND INCEST. Since I'm pro-choice, the whole restriction on a woman's fundamental right to decide what happens to her own body in any instance bothers me immensely, but I guess since I recently became a rape and domestic violence advocate I find the lack of compassion for rape survivors especially disgusting about the law.  I can't even imagine if I had to be an advocate in South Dakota and tell a survivor that she had to birth her rapist's child if she didn't want to.  PPNYC.org has a place to send an e-mail to Gov. Mike Rounds of South Dakota basically telling him he's a huge douchebag and I encourage everyone to do so.

"event","So I missed most of the State of the Union last night due to volunteer class and since I do always try to watch it (even though each year I find myself yelling profanities at the screen more and more) I was a little bit in a hurry to get home and see what kind of bullshit was spewing forth this year. Per usual, I was not impressed or surprised and found the call for a ""competitiveness"" initiative especially elementary and retarded.  But then, just when I thought it was par for the course comes this:

""Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most egregious abuses of medical research...human-animal hybrids...""

I think he has finally lost it.

Do these exist?  Are some kind of strange lizard people hidden in an enclave off the coast of Rhode Island where they are being stored in case of nuclear fallout so that we can start of master race of people with the ability to use logic and reason WHILE swimming under water. Are there monkey people roaming around Area 51 waiting to break out of their unnatural habitat, take over the trees in our backyards and throw feces at us?  Has Bush finally misconstrued the doodles he makes at his desk of human bodies with dog faces as fact?  

Seriously, why isn't the media looking more into this? If these freaks of nature exist I want to see them in some sort of reality show on MTV like ""True Life: I'm half monkey"" or something.  I think that if I was a human-animal hybrid I would like to be half cheetah because it would be cool to run fast and I like to eat meat.  Oh look, now I'm talking like that's possible."

Was it the free coffee mugs handed out so our coffee costs only a $1 instead of $1.50?  Or perhaps it is the setting in fascinating, bustling Hoboken, NJ.  I guess only Fortune Magazine knows...

"event","I must say I am a tad conflicted about the transit strike.  ""Fortunately"" it doesn't affect my commute to work as the PATH is a separate entity so I don't have any personal bitterness towards striking workers.  Usually I'm fairly pro-union since they tend to represent groups of workers who routinely get the shaft.  Plus, in the words of the immortal Fucking Go, ""Fuck the MTA.""  However, the more I read about the TWU demands, the more unreasonable they seem.  So they don't want to contribute any of their paycheck for health insurance or retirement funding.  Yeah, I'd like that too.  I'd also like to retire at 55 and be guaranteed an average salary of $50K without actually having to produce results.  And an 8% pay raise for 3 consecutive years?  That'd be pretty freakin' sweet.  The husband's company gave their employees a big 0% increase this year due to lack of funding - then they told him to go and buy a $1000 couch for the house he runs. Yeah, sure public workers probably need more protection than private empolyees who have more options for promotion and no salary ceiling, but come on. The MTA puts a deal on the table that allows the TWU to get average to high annual raises for the next three years (3%, 4%, 3 1/2% - much more then a lot of peoples' annual raises) and keep your retirement at 55 and they turn it down! That seems disingenous and grandstanding to me. However, the back and forth between people on the transit workers' blog has been a fantastic read for my slow days at work now that the end of the year is here and all the polymer physicists have better things to do then submit articles to my journal:

We were in Ephrata, PA which is close to where I grew up so it was nice to be back in the area.  The people at the printer were really nice and hospitable - truly great people.

Then this morning I see this -

Mike Borden was the regional manager of the printer and I met him on Thursday.  He and his wife were shot to death on Sunday morning and his daughter was kidnapped. 

He was a really affable and genuine person.  Everyone at the company seemed very close-knit and I know he had been at Cadmus for years.  I'm glad I got a chance to meet him."

If there is any sort of justice the people in the emails who were more concerned with their own steak dinners while tens of thousands of people were starving should be thrown in jail for criminal negligence.  At the very least they should be fired and shunned from any sort of future employment in the public or private sector.  Unfortunately, given the history of what happens to callous, incompetant people in this administration, they will probably be presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom."

Finally, it's the month anniversary of the ""surprise"" San Fran trip and it makes me sad. It's amazing that all of my best friends from high school can get together after all living apart for 8 years in multiple cities and its as if we were still back in Hershey High School.  It's also pretty amazing that I at first thought the Bay Bridge was the Golden Gate Bridge, but that's a different story."

They make the rules and the teachers must follow them. Teachers who don't obey are punished severely. The king of the anarchy is decided by a competition among the boys. They must go to the roof of their school and hang off of a railing. The boy who can clap the most before falling or quiting becomes the king. Anyone who challenges the king and fails is beaten.


<h3>While watching the movie...</h3><br><p align=""justify"">The music is hardly noticable, but that doesn't really matter. The humor is in the movie is absolutely sickening, but the idea is great. The casting is right-on, and the characters portrayed nicely; for anyone who's read the manga. While it's pretty short, the content is great and often surprising. From the torture sequences to the isolation of the main character, this film will have you cringing and thinking.  


<h3>Final thoughts and the score...</h3><br><p align=""justify""><i>Blue Spring</i> not only has an abrupt beginning, the awe lasts for the entirety of the film. It offers sick comedy for some and powerful issues for others. A perfect mix for me, however. I feel that this film deserves a <b>8.5</b> out of <b>10</b>."

I just got this movie and watched it today and I'm speechless. While I do apologize for this, I also want you to understand how great this movie is. The only way to really describe it is like a 90 minute cut scene; the best cut scene you've ever seen. Although, I suppose as a huge fan of the series and the game, my thoughts would be a bit biased, but then again, the only people that this movie was made for are people who...enjoy the series or the game.

<h3>That said...</h3>
See this movie, it will make your life complete. The music was amazing and perfect for the action sequences. And the action sequences, sweet jesus, the action sequences. Fast paced and absolute fury are hardly enough to explain how great they were. Everything from the graphics to the camera movements is beautifully done. My score, and ONLY because I just can't give it a 10, is <b>9.9</b> out of <b>10</b>. See it, love it."

The story is about a man named Chow Mo-Wan and his life as a lover and a writer. It takes place during the 1960's and certainly has it's atmosphere, but also uses brilliant colors to show the future. The plot comes out through Chow's encounters with his women and his feeling after they have left him.

<h3>While watching the movie...</h3>
Like many of the movies I watch, the first thing I notice is the scoring. 2046 has some excellent music that parallels the setting and mood of the story. During the start of the film, there are many scenes that don't fit with what's happening in the story. A woman may be walking down the street, and we see a shot of her dress, but its not the same dress, it's a different color and design. Then the shot comes back to the woman wearing the dress from before. This kind of thing happens alot, but we later find out the meaning. 2046 is a movie about memories, and the fight to hold on to them.

<h3>Final thoughts and the score...</h3>
2046 has a very slow start. There are shots of things that are incongruent to the story we are givin and it isn't until much later in the movie that we find out what it all means. In the end, I really enjoyed this movie. I thought there were some comedy but, over all, it's a drama worth watching. I give it an <b>8.8</b> out of <b>10</b>."

This is one of those movies you see and think, ""I thought of something just like that once!"" Old Boy is a story about a man named Oh Daesu who, for no see-able reason is prisoned for 15 years then suddenly let go without any explanation. While imprisoned, he is framed for various crimes and his name is slandered all over the city. After being freed, he begins a hunt to find the people responsible for his imprisonment.

<h3>While watching the movie...</h3>
There were no parts that were really boring in this film. A lot of times, a movie will be a great experience but have some rough spots. While this one certainly has it's rough spots, they weren't boring. The sketchy parts of this film, at least to an American viewer, involved the reasons behind Oh Daesu's caging. Some of the things that happen in this film just do not happen in American films, but that in no way means that I didn't like it. It had a certain shock value to it. My favorite part of this movie was the scoring. I've always loved how Asian movies seem to use more classical music in their scoring, which is why I liked this one so much. From the beginning, the music sets the tone for the story, and the viewer gets a strong idea of what the overall mood will be. There wasn't anything too outlandish in the way the movie was shot. There were obviously alot more long shots and handheld shots than in American movies, but as far a any foriegn film goes, nothing out of the ordinary.

<h3>Final thoughts and the score...</h3>
I really enjoyed watching this movie. Not once was I taken away from the story or distracted by mistakes in the plot or acting. That may, of course, just be because I'm so used to the way Korean and Japanese films are made. I recommend this movie for anyone who likes to watch action based foriegn films. I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite Korean films. I give it a <b>9.2</b> out of <b>10</b>."

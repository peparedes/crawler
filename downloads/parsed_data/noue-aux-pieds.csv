It would be easy to let the
coals burn out if it weren't for the
images of

the two of them clasping their hands,
hanging on so hard we fear the
whiplash, heartbreak,

the awareness of our bodies
caught upside down with ears ringing, 
tongues tying knots,

but it's not the desire to be
between the sheets, pulling, pushing--
rather, we're stuck

too long with our solitary
introspection, frustrated at
finding ourselves

between walls of cardboard and red
brick that threaten to shatter from
the shrill night cry."

Rational thought would not
allow for this sort of
debauched fantasy: blonde
on blonde, black and white, the
bobbing and weaving and
classic spitting flames; it's

all just for the sake of
scoring a goal here and
there. That gel in your hair
is getting all over your
sensible, stylish cap.

Forget it, like when we
turned and turned on dirty
off-white carpeting, in
awe of what thousands of
years built up for; it's too

cold to get out of the
car for a cigarette.
Her thoughts were only as
deep as her pockets, and
I'm the sort of person

that deals in terms of raw
elitism, plastic
for plasticine, paper
now and again for those
fleeting quantum moments.

The wrought-iron doors left that
behind for good, didn't
they, or is the park bench
only as good as the
baby running towards it,

hands down, steam-engine legs
pumping ten times over
the midwest in winter--
don't blame me, honey, I'm
only as good as the

booze right now. Think--if I
thought I knew then, wherefore
the silent stare, stand up,
the leather-jacket glance
of hot disapproval?

Not now. I dreamed a dream
tonight; that's all. It's all
there, on record: cigar smoke,
the freeway. Don't worry,
I don't intend to bother

with this sort of far-fetched
prosthesis for a while.
Best to let it boil and
burn over; hot moments
against my right shoulder.

Faded skeleton scars,
tracing out the letters
in rusted curves. Caffeine.
The prints, obscured by brown
paper, month after month."

Christmas is still a good
six months away, but the
images would not leave:

the chopping in sterile
grayscale flashing white, the
hanging black limbs swinging

from the bodies beaten
and swollen, in a white
suit of linen and soft

excuses, milled like fresh
powder underneath. Feet
spilling out from beneath

hearts and knees, battered by
cameras and always your
damn sexy slouch and lean,

knotted up in a red
sweatshirt, alone in the
woods, between stockings and

cute frilly whites like it's
so uncomfortable
to sit and watch, purple

and splitting right down the 
middle. Fennel. The real
quintessence of what it

is to be ROCK AND ROLL!,
hidden behind stony
gray flaphouses, the deaf

girls imposing a sense
of decorum, mature
and composed, like it's so

hard to stitch apart the
sobbing forehead as it
whimpers and moans, all staged."

There it went again - the
flashing comet in the
night sky: how it arched its
back, opened its mouth and
yawned real big to show off
the pink. On TV there's

Michael Jackson's ""Thriller,""
the grainy montage of
torn costumes and mountains
of makeup, the shimmy-
shake and melodrama. 
""I'm not like other guys.""

It's always couched in some
kind of weighty euphe-
mism, as if being
frank would collapse and crush
your windpipe. No, it's so
much safer this way: hands

firmly gripping the ban-
ister, the squirming weight
pulling down the staircase
for three Milk-Bones and a
shot in the arm. It was
was all so green when it

struck me. Tomorrow in
the afternoon, going
fishing. Tripping so hard,
under all the bedclothes
(that blanket made the list!),
right through your chest, suck on

that motherfucker. Taut
lines, dirty hair, sweaters
from the San Francisco
days. Matching blacks. A sense
of self-control. Indus-
trial pressing, the weight

around your neck. A bag
full of new-born puppies.
The metal discs that fell
around, throwing colors
into pupils and through
car doors. The room, filling

up with water. You've most
likely put two and two
together to make this
story, no matter how
stupid you claim to be.
Oh, THIS one's such childs' play.

Divine movement. Kidnapped,
spirited away to
pocketknives, my foot caught
firmly in my mouth. Back-
wards bending arms and the
wobbly head at the wheel."

We were under the bleachers
and the car seat kept rolling
back and forth, her laughing like
a delighted child. The sand

whipping through the Northeastern
air, in your San Francisco
camera lens. The visceral
parts of it: smells, gazes met,

on the way to the sixth floor,
barely made it out of the
elevator before you
found yourself with purple marks

up and down your legs and the
unshakeable feeling that
murderers get, going through
all the details frantically

in your head for the first time,
the sickly sweet and dripping
faucets: ""Am I fucking you?""
One crushed night below the whole

mass and might of the Royal
Navy. Trash. Breaking the cups
against the floor. Feet like big
cockroaches, love. Mess. All yours."

there's either too much here or
too little for me. letters
searing into flesh - shoulders,
arms, chests, the breasts too big, the
belly soft and wide like a
fish. learning the alphabet.
it's not that far removed from

strangling, choking garottes

immolation. the feeling

anoited in holy oil,
gasoline pump overflow,

sneaking in and out, in only
a towel and shouting, ""fuck! fuck!""
the sweat from your brows, the coals

soreness and the awkwardness

concentrated in one spot
at one instant, freezing air,
snow all over the pretty
spring grass (weighs heavy over
the graves!). condemned to the woods
with a young girl. an answer

to the crime: the punishment!
Canadian TV late
at night, with hot flannel suits,
chinese food, dark hallways full
of leather, guitar strings, thick-
rimmed glasses. shake it, shake it,
throw it across the room to

collapse across the bed like
a hollow rag-doll. plastic
cups, sliding coffee lids, black
rubber tires stabbing at the
snowy ground with metal teeth,
rubs against your legs at night,
head pushed into itching head,

crayons, the back seat. seedy
traffic circles. a bloody
mess. the mere though was enough
to leave you stunned as if with an
axe. grasping at the back of
the pew-bench. come to a stop

Bathroom tile,
cracked and pushing up
to slide through
paper, nostrils, lungs,

our aching

Knives out and
broken pills around

the table.
Sleep spent instead on
sledgehammers,
battering the knees

of my heart,
the soft snow calling
for blood and
broken limbs. Wooden

axles, of
oak. The smell of smoke

An ancient

rhythm, staying

coffee, music
at 3 in

old brass band
wailing Dixie

Knotted stomach,
ill-balanced

The turntable spins with all the
intense precision
of a

locomitive's driving wheels. The
sounding of a steam
whistle,

a teapot on the stove. Boxes
of old baby clothes,
hand-knit.

The flash of a headlight beacon,
puncturing the still
night life,

driving for resolution. An

warrior

before the rising tide. A quilt

heavy

Scottish wool, dripping from the shoul-

A wine glass left out on the
table. My father
rose, pushed up by thirst, the constant
pain in his feet from a pinched nerve,
his soft monument

in foam and cotton. The
faithful stumble, drunk
and dreaming of Heaven's glory,
sleeping under piles of books in
ivory doorways.

Snow monsters. The mere thought
of dalliance. Your
body, curved and pressing against
an anvil. The shrill of hammers
and glass bottle blows.

Unreasonable, we
boxed ourselves into
seismic piano shifts, curling
into each other's outlined forms.
Swollen red shapes. Christ

hanging like a clean shirt.
Nightmares. Proportions
left swinging all akimbo. The
stick of the night watchman, tapping
at the iron fence."

We drove into the snow,
blind as new-born kittens
and just as cold.

I drank myself sober,
drove in straight lines
on winding back roads.

Your tongue burned my guilty hands.
Spiders, they crept over and under
the soft red crime.

I watched as feet took form
beneath my knees, poured in
like cement, hardened

to break shins and fingers.
I gripped the fleshy wheel.
Pushed gas and breaks.

Followed these lines and sat back.
Some I wished I'd written.
Some I wished I hadn't.

Thought back on blankets and couches,
feet on tables, words hanging
like fly-paper in the air.

Fumbled through liner notes of
people and albums I love,
trying in vein to

see how they corrolate,
curled in a reflex
(like kissing you);

felt pressure at points of contact,
depressions left deep and
remaining after the fact.

Sunk through cushions, pushed
in by the weight of water
and nervous bodies,

lungs already stained yellow
like road lines, constricted
and struggling to move

in the natural fashion, in and
out. Severed through glass
and duly noted

that I couldn't tell
the blotted white sky
from the snow-covered ground."

Antiquated people waved us on.
Numbers and compliments.
Middle-aged expressions of
watered-down gratitude,
thanks, wonderful boys.
Mashed potatoes.

It left us with no voices,
scratching and clawing
our way towards a 
kind of comprehension.
Anger and laugher on
the living-room couches.

Sisters and friends. Running
dejected from the house.
Sat in the back among
the older, brighter models
of students. Yearned for
solace from crashing

speakers, will, glaciers.
All the kids needed to
go meet in the basement.
My lead was growing tight.
Traced the asphalt path past
houses and subconscious.

Returned to find myself longing for
white clapboard churches,
solid oak pews, a simple
studio apartment with only a
cat for a wife, vinyl, mint,
the old knitted afghan in the

chest of drawers, a friend
drowning under family and
skyscrapers, the simple comfort
of the Midwest. For was this
done by wreathing my body seven times
round with blood-letting heaviness.

To calm down was too much
to ask, the scene wouldn't
allow it. A long silver Zeppelin,
like a Titan's finger, stroked the
sky before clawing and
raging at Heaven in flames.

Wheels spun. I followed a great
wooden horse, rocking gently, gently
up and down, and from side to side.
I stole tapes and poems.
The stain on the blacktop was
a yellowed Jesus, calling me home.

Slept before a fireplace out of
Magritte. I steeped myself in
peppermint and chocolate,
the simple melodies of Shaker
hymns and cold wooden mornings.
A train crept out of the fireplace,

a long, silver finger prodding
at the serenity of the couch, the
afghan, the solid oak chest of
drawers. I considered my cat,
named for records and dusty old books.
The Lutheran train for Bern, 1905.

Dapper in a 3-piece cotton grey suit,
shirtsleeves. Coming down
from the sky, from field to bed.
It could have been very fresh and
clean. Violin. Burning logs. The old
organ in the church, full of dust. These are the days."

"event","so i was going to take a crap before and then i got a phone call just as i was in the midst of pulling down my pants

it was melissa, and shes like what are you doing..and im like..taking a shit..and then shes all...i got news

she told me that my good freind lindsays mother passed away....


i knew it was the death call.&nbsp; i could tell by the tone in her voice.&nbsp; i just didnt think it would be her.&nbsp; i mean, shes been sick for a long time, but melissa said she was getting better and then all of a sudden...o man.&nbsp; thats all i could say.&nbsp; ysee, ive known this woman since elementary school days.&nbsp; she always loved me and everytime i saw her she would smile and say i look good or something.&nbsp; she was such a sweet lady.

and when i heard all this news...the only thing i could think about was whats gonna happen to lindsay and especially her little brother. 

life sucks hard a lot

and then on top of everything...i was supposed to go up to forestville tomorrow and buy lydia dinner, and then be all romantic, and then saturday i was going to see bedouin soundclash with her in buffalo...and then come back here sunday. 

and now, i have no idea what to do or what im doing. and that just hurts.&nbsp; i feel so selfish.&nbsp; i want to do both so bad. i feel if i dont do one, i hurting the other way too much.&nbsp; but i think theres a few ways i can pull off both.&nbsp; it all falls upon when the wake is.&nbsp; wish me luck.&nbsp; and keep valerie in your prayers.&nbsp; 

i wish i knew you better
i love you march family."

"event","so its been 8 weeks since i last posted
thats for that information livejournal, but no one was worried

i should be exhasuted right now.&nbsp; i worked ten hours today.&nbsp; ten am to 8 pm. but im not for some reason.
all i can think about is the past, the fact that im going back to school on sunday, and how good a cigarette sounds 
all i did this entire break was work like a mexican, barely hang out with my friends, and make money, but anywho
ive come to the conclusion, that my life is just a series of memories.&nbsp; 
everything people really think about are memories
unless theyre in the future, or course
but as soon as they happen, they are in the past and then are just a thought
which leads to me to the conclusion, that fun, and enjoiment
are a drug.&nbsp; 

makes sense,&nbsp; they release the chemicals in your brain that make you happy
much like controlled substances.. and they are only temporary
come on, who stays happy for like ever.&nbsp; i dont.&nbsp; if you do, god bless.

and im kinda excited to back to college
get my drink on.&nbsp; do good in school. see my pretty lady
it sucks cuz a lot of my friends either dropped out or flunked out, already...yeah i know. what losers
but i still have a few good ones up there.
and ive been a good boy this whole break and only drank once,
so im gona be a lightweight when i go back.&nbsp; yaa. cheap fun.

and i have ex girlfriends stuck on my mind.&nbsp; its been this way for a while and its terribly depressing
ever since that wednesday when i went to the city.&nbsp; like, ive totaly moved on, but when you with a person
who you havnt really seen or talked to in a long time, and that you used to care about...its fucking strange.
life moves so fast and we change lovers even quicker.&nbsp; like, id probably still be with the last girl i was with
if she wasnt with two other people when we were dating.&nbsp; i blamed myself for that one.&nbsp; dumb move pat.
and its weird reading her profile and tis all lovely dovey. yea, ima slight stalker.&nbsp; maybe.&nbsp; hopefully not
but i think its pretty ludacris

only 29 more days until im done with my restricted licence crap
then ill take a bus down. get my car. drive back
do my 50 hours of community service from the court
and then enjoi life a little bit

and streetlight might play at the nyack center.
thats probably the best news ive ever heard"

"event","ill start from today, and work backwards.&nbsp; because my memory sucks
today, i went to class.&nbsp; and i cheated really badly on a math test that i probably still wont pass.&nbsp; but thanks ken, your a nice guy.&nbsp; i also skipped my comp and history class just so i could leave early to make it to pep rally that i shouldnt have been at.&nbsp; the drive wasnt bad.&nbsp; i had my buddy kyle to keep my company.&nbsp; he lives in the city, and when he heard i was going home, asked if i could drop him at a train station.&nbsp; i said sure, because im a nice guy.&nbsp; we made great time and he had some really good rap on his ipod. but anyway, i was in terry town at 6 20, made it jimmys at 7, and then to the pep at 7 15.&nbsp; met up with my homies.&nbsp; saw some ladies and old friends.&nbsp; and then it hit me.&nbsp; that i just shouldnt be there.&nbsp; its no longer my school.&nbsp; its overun run by new freshman, and the seniors there are the heads now.&nbsp; im just the old guy who graduated.&nbsp; i got the same feeling in nyack last week when i was there.&nbsp; like i had an amazing time because i was with my bests, but like, its just no longer my town.&nbsp; but the pep rally...sucked.&nbsp; not enough pep. and the rally was not so populated.&nbsp; last year, they had to barrocade the seniors back. this year they were boring.&nbsp; the bon fire was small.&nbsp; but still there.&nbsp; and as i walked back to my car, i came to find two young people making out on it...or up against it.&nbsp; and when i asked them to leave, the kid aggresivly spoke to me and wanted to fight me.&nbsp; hes a junoir, and im a freshman in college.&nbsp; i just didnt understand why he wanted to fight me.&nbsp; i was wearing my jersey, and so was he.&nbsp; there should be some mutual respect form that.&nbsp; and the fact that he was on my car..and got in my face....just total disrespect.&nbsp; and im trying this new thing where i try to be totaly non violent, but this kid make me snap. and i told him to get the fuck away from me, cuz i was ready to kill him.&nbsp; but im better than that, and i didnt fight him.&nbsp; he just walked away thinking he won the arguement.&nbsp; whatever.&nbsp; i was so mad that i couldnt drive or sit still for ten minutes.&nbsp; then i came home. had chili. and brittany stopped by.&nbsp; i gave her a pig i named&nbsp; Professor Oinks, and she renamed it Clay Bacon.&nbsp; haha. love.

my only accomplishment this week besides cheating on that math test that i still wont pass and not killing my room mate, was that on wednesday, i went 9 and 0 in beer pong.&nbsp; and while that may seem like a bad thing to be proud of, i really am.&nbsp; o, and that i learned how to play the didgeridoo.&nbsp;&nbsp; thats awesome. and that night was one of the most amazing nights of my life.&nbsp; coming home and seeing like most of my close friends in my favorite town at my favorite spots.&nbsp; priceless.&nbsp; dancing to guido music and just being ourselves.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;
a lot of people say that they miss me and that things dont seem to be the same without me.&nbsp; i dont belive it.&nbsp; im flattered, but life goes on even with out the condor.&nbsp; [thats what they call me on the v ball court].&nbsp; and im watching it go on with out me.&nbsp; with the new scene, and the new freshman and seniors.&nbsp; life goes on whether we want it to or not.&nbsp; i also find that i dont have a definitte answer on my view of college.&nbsp; depending on the person, or just what im saying, ill change my answer. ill either say its good, its too county, or it just sucks.&nbsp; im not really sure how i truely feel about it, but i now realize that i cant stay in rockland.&nbsp; the town has moved on without me way too fast and i just dont really belong her anymore.&nbsp; and thats strange to think and say, because last week i woulda have killed to be back here,...but its just too much.&nbsp; i am happy in my secluded mountain school with my redneck friends and with the older woman who barely talk to me.&nbsp; i just dont know thoough. i feel like im stuck in transition.&nbsp; i wanna be there when im here and i wanna be here when im there.&nbsp; double homesickness.&nbsp; but i know that i need to back to school, and now fuck up anymore.&nbsp; because i have nothing here to look forward too besides seeing my friends.&nbsp; 

i finnaly learned how to spell tomorrow. and speaking of it, its gonna be interesting.&nbsp; maybe breakfast in the am.&nbsp; then im buying brittany lunch at panera.&nbsp;&nbsp; then the game.&nbsp; then dinner out with kids. and then maybe jumping in this girls limo and going dancing in white plains.&nbsp; i doubt it, but i was invited for only the low low price of 80 dollars.&nbsp; and then sunday, picking up kyle from the train station and back to reality.&nbsp; and i fucking forgot mad stuff for homework, so when i get back, i have to trace a bunch of trees, draw a building defined by space, whatever that means, on a piece of 16 x 24 paper, do math homework, which i dont understand, and then start writing a reserch paper on WalMart.&nbsp; college is interesting.&nbsp; i find it funny.&nbsp; the idea of college and what it is.&nbsp; like highschool...is a joke leading up to it.&nbsp; its basically make as many friends as you can in highschool and then lose them all when u go to college.&nbsp; if you dont stay local, you really probably lose all you had.&nbsp; i did.&nbsp; i had a nice niche before i left.&nbsp; good job.&nbsp; nice little venue.&nbsp; nice school. broken home.&nbsp; ok. im gonna stop bitching? is that what they call it.&nbsp; 

this girl baught me apple cider at school.&nbsp; it was delicous.&nbsp; i didnt know how to thank her."

"event","so.&nbsp; warped tour was fun.&nbsp; i went saturday and sunday.&nbsp; i liked saturday better.&nbsp; we got there quicker and there was just sooo much anticipation.&nbsp; when we got there, i had a bottle of nestea and this dude just poured vodka in it.&nbsp; that was a nice way to start the day.&nbsp; the stage setup was confusing and whoever named the stages was retarted.&nbsp; why would there be a hurley and a hurley.com stage.&nbsp; i saw mad bands tho.&nbsp; a static lulliby, biffy clyro, as i lay dying, chiodos, coheed and cambria, and probably some more.&nbsp; and i played nice guy at teh concert.&nbsp; at the water truck, there was total chaos, so i just chilled there at the front filling up peoples bottles for like half an hour.&nbsp; the day went on with plenty of music, but nothing that interesing happened.

sunday was cool too. my brother came, and it was his first concert, so it was rad.&nbsp; as we were going to englishtown, and we were maybe five miles away, we hit this terrible traffic.&nbsp; we chilled there for and hour, the whole time i was talking to people and walking around, a.nd said fuck this.&nbsp; we followed his gps and got there five minutes later.&nbsp; we saw biffy clyro again and met up with melissa and lindsay, that was awesome.&nbsp; then we saw coheed again, and gallows, and a bunch of other bands. my favorite part of the whole day, was new found glory. soo good.&nbsp; and i saw this with my friends and this chick that i was really crushing on, and it was just a good moment in life.&nbsp; thank you warped tour.&nbsp; 

and this girl, that i listened to nfg with is amazing.&nbsp; i went out on a date with her yesterday, and it was the most fantastic time.&nbsp; we say i know pronounce you chcuk and larry, and it was really depressing, but we still had a great time.&nbsp; i havnt been on a date or anything like it in such a long time.&nbsp; but to my luck, i wen ttwo weeks before i leave for college.&nbsp; so it was kinda pointless, but i still wouldnt have traded it for anything.&nbsp; i wish i met her like a few months ago..but hey, thats life.&nbsp; i chilled with her today, she works at an ice cream parlor, and she showed me her art book, and apparently shes mad artistic.&nbsp; and she made this one drawing of two people holding hands with new found glory lyrics at the bottom of the page....i cant get her out of my head.&nbsp; 

my last day of work is tommarow.&nbsp; thats sad.&nbsp; ive been there for like over a year and im just so attatched to it.&nbsp; everyone loves me there, and the work i do.&nbsp; i dont know waht im going to do with myself once i dont have to work there.&nbsp; the warehouse guy said he dosnt wanna work with the new guy and really only wants to work with me.&nbsp; love that drunk. and im almost done painting lights.&nbsp; that makes me happy.&nbsp; two weeks ago, my boss said i have to paint all 54 lights in the store black.&nbsp; and i have four left.&nbsp; its gonna be cool to finish up there. but im gonna miss it

"event","i worked ten hours today.&nbsp; it was tough, but i made 82 bucks.&nbsp; not bad.&nbsp; and afterword, i went out for wings with jim and matt, and tj malgieri and weird beard decided to join us too.&nbsp; it was fun but the wings went right through me.&nbsp; not fun
yesterday, i saw two movies in theaters.&nbsp; i saw the simpsons in the afternoon with matt jim and zach.&nbsp; and i then i saw harry potter with my family.&nbsp; the simpsons movie rocked and harry potter was kinda lacking.

and saturday, was soo busy.&nbsp; i left in the morning for south bound brook new jersey, probably for the last time.&nbsp; the saddest part of the whole trip was that it only took an hour....a fucking hour.&nbsp; i could have made that tirp a million times instead of just waiting up here and loosing the girl i cared about so much.&nbsp; but that chapter in my life is gone.&nbsp; anyway, i went down there to give her some closure, and it was nice seeing her.&nbsp; we walked around her town and chilled in a really nice park.&nbsp; i tried to teach her some guitar, because i know she really wants to learn.&nbsp; and i bought her some lunch.&nbsp; im good at closing things.

i came home in time just to catch my grandmas bbq.&nbsp; some nice food.&nbsp; got out of there and went to vickys graduation party.&nbsp; i wanted to get smashed, but it just wasnt an option.&nbsp; so after two hours there, i came home and julia picked me up to go to the hookah bar again.&nbsp; it was a sweet drive and its just awesome there.&nbsp; hookah is just amazing, and mixed with live hip hop and raggae just cant get any better.&nbsp; after a couple hours or smoking and grooving, we left and i got home round 1.&nbsp; not bad.&nbsp; 

college is soon.&nbsp; im excited to learn shit, and im excited to meet mad people.&nbsp; and&nbsp; just being away will be nice.&nbsp; but im just not looking foward to leaving my friends behind, and espeically my family.&nbsp; i know life will go on without me, but my family is a very fragile thing.&nbsp; im pretty sure im the one keeping my dad sane, because all my mom and brother do is give him shit.&nbsp; and i keep my mom not pissed off by chilling withher, which my brother will never do.&nbsp; and what about Finn? damnit.&nbsp; fucking school.&nbsp; i am excited for hanging out with the hott girl ive already met.&nbsp; 

life has slowed down, but things are gonna pick up again real soon.&nbsp; warped tour is this weekend and its gonna be FUCKING NUTS.&nbsp; cant wait.&nbsp; its gonna be the best weekend ever.&nbsp; and then next next thursday, im done at my job.&nbsp; and then five days after i leave for cali.&nbsp; come back a week later, and leave the day after for college.&nbsp; rough scheduel.&nbsp; bring it on."

"event","im wondering to myself why im home right now.&nbsp; its friday.&nbsp; i should be out chilling with my peeps or partying, but im not.&nbsp; im just chilling on my new lap top listening to the rap cd i got fromt he hookah bar.&nbsp; but i thought id write because a lot of stuff is happening and id like to remember it ina month.

so, this is my lucky week.&nbsp; not my lucky day, but week mo fucka.&nbsp; its weird.&nbsp; some crazy stuff has happened and i think its because im lucky this week.

but ill go backwards farther before i get to that.&nbsp; orientation was sunday and monday.&nbsp; and that was fun.&nbsp; i dove all six hours up and six hours back because i figure i should get kinda used to it.&nbsp; but yeah, it was fun.&nbsp; and i broke every awkward situation i could.&nbsp; we would all be chilling ina room, and i would be the first to say something.&nbsp; thatll come in handy come august.&nbsp; the first day was a little slow, but i met some nice people and at this mixer thing, i danced with some chicks and black guys.&nbsp; got a couple phone numbers, a stalker, and a real idea of what im in for.&nbsp; im gonna miss you rockland.&nbsp; just as soon as i really started to love you and settle in, i have to leave.&nbsp; just wish me a bon viage.

i work so much now adays.&nbsp; my last pay check was for 426, not to brag or anything, but thats a lot of fucking money.&nbsp; divide by 8 = 53 and a half hours.&nbsp; damn homey.&nbsp; no wonder i havnt really seen any of my honeys or homeys. 

but wednesday, i didnt go to work.&nbsp; i went deep sea fishing with my dad brother and jimmy.&nbsp; we left at 5 in the morning and i drove to jersey, because my dad really cant drive that well anymore.&nbsp; hes getting worse, but thats a while other entry full of stuff.&nbsp; anywho, we got to my grandmas house round 7 i think.&nbsp; who cares.&nbsp; but the fishing was fun.&nbsp; only no one was catching anything.&nbsp; at the end of the day maybe 8 fish were caught between all ten people on the boat.&nbsp; jimmy kind of caught a fish [the deckhand really did] and i caught a real big sea bass and a big fluke.&nbsp; since i caught the two biggest fish on the boat, i won the 30 dollar pool. not bad. [that was the beggining of my luck]. but how is catching fish lucky? aside from the obv., heres the story.&nbsp; about 85% through fishing, it started to rain, and then to pour.&nbsp; but i kept fishing.&nbsp; everone else went in and i heard the deckhand say that since i was still fishing, we wouldnt go into land yet.&nbsp; but i didnt have too much time.&nbsp; so, just as the boat is about to start up and leave, i feel the tug on my rod...haha...anyway, i reeled up this big fluke and it was just an awesome moment.

then we went to this dinner, and i got the biggest burger, actually double cheese burger, and ate in five minutes.&nbsp; im so accomplished.

then yesterday, i woke up and went to work at my dads friends house. at like 12 we finished up and i went home, showered and then went to nyack.&nbsp; why to nyack, because i was gonna catch the bus to the city for the SHOUT it loud tour. [Against all athority, STREETLIGHT MOTHERFUKING MANIFESTO, Reel Big fish, and Less than Jake].&nbsp; me and bizzle bronxed caught the bus up to my foxy lady and then we roamed the city.&nbsp; yaaa brittany and liz.&nbsp; anyway.&nbsp; roseland sucks.&nbsp; the sounds guys didnt really do a good job, but streetlight was awesome.&nbsp; and the crowd was a lot more fucking rough that i thought would be.&nbsp; no room to skank, or breath.&nbsp; i thought i might pass out.&nbsp; maybe i should eat next time.&nbsp; but it was a great time.&nbsp; and my ticket only cost 60 bucks from a scalper.&nbsp; weee. and i didnt pay for it.&nbsp; i used the money from the pool and from a graduation check.&nbsp; so it was kinda lucky that i got the ticket.&nbsp; i heard other kids payed a hundred bucks, and i saw that some tickets were just straight up fakes.&nbsp; and plus i got in, so that was lucky.&nbsp; and um...as we were leaving, this drunk woman touched my face and made a noise. and then her drunk boy friend went...and i quote ""thats my girl man...your lucky""&nbsp; 

so, he either meant that i was lucky cuz she touched me, that i was lucky because he wasnt going to beat the snot out of me, or because....im just lucky this week.&nbsp; he knew it..and he was the sign affirming it.&nbsp; believe what you want and ill belive what i want.&nbsp; just like prom.

so.&nbsp; i dont know if the luck has ran out yet, or what. but im gonna keep testing it.&nbsp; im gonna need it soon.&nbsp; schools coming.&nbsp; and next week im going to visit a friend of mine.&nbsp; ill need some strength and luck that day.&nbsp; i miss her. and im gonna teach her guitar.&nbsp; changing lives one person at a time.&nbsp;

"event","[by the by, im not really writing this to tell you what happened, im writing this so i can remember what happened down the road, but feel free to enjoi all the details]<br /><br />prom was fantastic.<br /><br />the actual prom itself was hulla short, but soo much fun.&nbsp; i was way dressed to kill and my date, arriane [maybe thats how you spell it],&nbsp; looked fantastic too.&nbsp; it was a nightmare taking pictures at joeys house and then having to sprint to alinas house, and then back to joeys house when it was wicked traficed.&nbsp; but it happened and then we drove off in our wicked cool party bus to prom.&nbsp; we danced most of the way to prom and when we got there, we had this little cocktail hour thing that i hated, but everyone else liked.&nbsp; after that, they opened up the dance floor and i began boogeeying down.&nbsp; soo much fun and my date was a phenominal dancer.&nbsp; such a good time.&nbsp; the food was crap and we got no gift, but i loved every second of it.&nbsp; after a few hours of dancing, everyone started to leave, so we did too.<br /><br />we changed in the parking lot and were off to the club.&nbsp; we kept up the dancing in the party bus and it just got insane.&nbsp; at this point, we got a little crunk and it just added a little to it.&nbsp; when we got the club, it was empty.&nbsp; so i started the dancing off and after a while, people started to fill the small room.&nbsp; it turned into utter chaos and became a huge orgy.&nbsp; the music was hott and i was dancing on the table with this girl.&nbsp; so much fucking fun.&nbsp; it shoulda been illegal. <br /><br />we left at like 2 in the morning or something and got on the bus ride home.&nbsp; we danced the entire way home too.&nbsp; it was nuts.&nbsp; we got back to joeys house and then everyone went to their designated sleeping house, except for me.&nbsp; i had to dive this kid shawn to spring valley for this stuff.&nbsp; so at like 4 i got back to matts house and the lost my cell phone.&nbsp; but after i found it, i got to take a diesel nap of about an hour and a half.&nbsp; woke up, and tried to take a shower, but i couldnt figure it out, so i ended up taking a really shitty bath.&nbsp; haha, so weird.<br /><br />we got to dinnotos at 7 and all got breakfast.&nbsp; all i got was coffee.<br /><br />the ride down into jersey wasnt bad.&nbsp; but of course we had to pick the beach that was farthest away, and i had no idea of that.&nbsp; but my car ride going down was groovy.&nbsp; me and julia were hysterically laughing the entire time and made some killer jokes that really stuck.&nbsp; it was nice, cuz we havnt really been that/this close in a while.&nbsp; and im glad.<br /><br />when we got to jersey, we got our rooms and unpacked and headed straight for the beach.&nbsp; the water was ice cold but that stopped no one from going in.&nbsp; but after like a half hour we all agreed to go out and just tan/lay on the beach.&nbsp; i told matt to write ""i like balls?"" in sun tan lotion on my back, and after i passed out and woke up, it was very nicely burned in there.&nbsp; <br /><br />we went back to our hotel to shower and jump in the pool.&nbsp; and by this time, its like 4 or 3 o clock, and all ive eaten all day is coffee, so i gathered up some people and decided to get some food.&nbsp; after walking past like 10 closed down restuarants, we found this awesome diner with the best french fries ive ever had.&nbsp; <br /><br />went back and walked on the board walk, and then after a while of seeing people that i know [my cousin chris, mike pilacik and smelliezer]&nbsp; we started walking back for some festivities.&nbsp; <br /><br />so, my downfall of the evening, aside from drinking, was drinking too much.&nbsp; i used a double shot to measure out all my drinks and i drank them way fast.&nbsp; so, i think the number i remember was having about 6 to 8 drinks, so really it was about double that.&nbsp; haha.&nbsp; and not only was i smashed, but i was crushing on this girl.&nbsp; and a very drunk confident patrick is a dangerous person.&nbsp; i ended up with my friends prom date [sorry joey] in my room for a while.&nbsp; i thought it was only like a half hour, but it was actually triple that?&nbsp; i dont remember or know.&nbsp;&nbsp; we had our share of fun and then melissa came back to the room and ended it.&nbsp; which was cool because i was ready to pass out as it.<br /><br />next day was terrible weather.&nbsp; it was raining all day and was just gloomy.&nbsp; but it didnt matter.&nbsp; we packed up all the rooms and went out to breakfast.&nbsp; some good pancakes and stuff.&nbsp; and we all discovered that shawn was missing half a finger.&nbsp; its nuts what you dont notice a lot of the time.&nbsp; <br /><br />we went to the boardwalk and just walked around for the rest of the day.&nbsp; not much happened.&nbsp; jim won like 500 tickets at this arcade in a raffle, and he was gonna get 500 plastic bugs, but i talked him out of it.&nbsp; <br /><br />we left not too long after that.&nbsp; i went with nick instead because he said he might not be able to drive, but he was fine.&nbsp; we got home later.&nbsp; not much excitment, except for when we stopped to get some coffee, jim and other people were there too.&nbsp; it was weird because it was some obsucre exit.&nbsp; got home and that was that.&nbsp; goodbye prom.&nbsp; goodbye jersey.&nbsp; thanks for the memories.<br /><br />spoilers after and during prom?:<br /><strike>mark lost his virginity and asked for it in the butt<br />i had sex with lindsey [joeys prom date] not that i remember it or agree that it happened<br />[but the evidence is against me]<br />most sun burn ive ever been<br /></strike>most fun ive ever had<br /><br />me julia gil jimmy adam laquilla shawn joey lindsey lindsey chris matt sara nick melissa mark<br />prom 07<br /><br /><br />[<strike><font size=""1"">i think i messed around with lindsey because i had a crush on her, whcih is weird for me.&nbsp; but it makes sence.&nbsp; joey told me afterword that she asked him out, and that hurt me, not that i told him, but what are you gonna do.&nbsp; u should never fall for a promiscuous girl.&nbsp; itll only lead to problems.&nbsp;

"event","my schools prom is in a little less than 24 hours.&nbsp; thats nerve-wracking.&nbsp; one of the last endevors of my high school life.&nbsp; i dont know to feel about that.&nbsp; i guess thats why i havnt been thinking about it.&nbsp; like, it really hasnt even crossed my mind.&nbsp; i know its happening, but i dont feel like it is.&nbsp; i think deep down, im scared for it to happen.&nbsp; because then whats left.&nbsp; schools done in a week or two.&nbsp; and i have two finals.&nbsp; maybe.&nbsp; rediculous.&nbsp; but i know i shouldnt worry, or be scared, because its gonna be some of the most fun ever.&nbsp; dancing at the prom, followed by more dancing afterwords, while dressed to kill in my fucking sexy tux.&nbsp; and then a weekend with no parents or responcibilities with my best friends and my ""i &lt;3 Jersey Sluts"" t-shirts that jim and i made today.&nbsp; so sweet.&nbsp; ill get a nice tan, and really relax. whilebeingpissdrunk.

i really dont know what to expect, or what will happen.&nbsp; im sure it will be full of problems and issues, but at the same time being uncontrollably fun.&nbsp; the idea is weird, but its not a stranger in my life.&nbsp; speaking of my life ...haha....thats enough of that.&nbsp; i was in barns and noble the other day, and while my friends were laughing really loud in the sexuality section, i was reading this book, also from the sex section, on how to get a girl from the bar to the bedroom.&nbsp; no reason why, it just seemed interesting.&nbsp; i found that most of it was common sense, for me at least, and that i really didnt learn anything, except that confidence is really required.&nbsp; and i think my confidence is shot.&nbsp; but i think thats what im gonna try to work on this weekend.&nbsp; life is so funny when you grow up.

my summer plans are building up.&nbsp; its mostly just concerts so far, but thats still awesome.&nbsp; ozzfest for free, warped tour twice, sounds of the underground, welcome to rockland show, countless parties, and the last week before i go to college im possibly going to california with my family to visit my dads rich friend and chill at his pad [which is on a cliff right on the water [be jealous]].&nbsp; thats if i graduate.&nbsp; haha.&nbsp; lots of work to make up and a short amount of time to do it.&nbsp; whos game?&nbsp; i am.&nbsp;"

im gonna go out on a quote.&nbsp; i cant remember it that well.&nbsp; i know its in the girls aim profile that i used to ..be friends with.

this friday, i performed at the backdoor.&nbsp; it was nerve-wracking and really tough, because i had problems with my set time, and i had to set up sound and a million other things too.&nbsp; but once i was up there rocking it, i had so much fun.&nbsp; i even played a song just for my mommy.&nbsp; and our last song was tribute, by tenacious d...and it was so fucking good.&nbsp; jim was really depressed right before we went on, and i talked to him..and you could immediatly sense the change in his singing when we went back on...and it was just euphoria.&nbsp; we rocked the house.&nbsp; and everyone was so nice and it was awesome.&nbsp; thanks for everyone that came out.&nbsp; 

yesterday was gold rush.&nbsp; it was lame and the best part of the day was that my parents bough me a gallon of water and a big italian hero.&nbsp; other than that, i threw pretty ok.&nbsp; got home mad early and then just passed out.

today, i woke up, mowed part of my lawn.&nbsp; i would have finished it, but i broke the blade.&nbsp; damn tree roots.&nbsp; then went to church, and then went to work, where i did nothing all day.&nbsp; i then worked on my whaling project with melissa, and we got hungry when we finished, so we got taco bell.&nbsp; we wound up at matts house and then at twist and shake and got some great motherfucking ice cream.&nbsp; and then we all got naked in the parking lot.&nbsp; basically.&nbsp; crazy shit yo.&nbsp;

work today was nuts.&nbsp; i had to move these huge remnants of carpet, about 13-15 feet tall, and they were heavy.&nbsp; after moving like 12 of them, i had to rip up the shitty carpet below them, and then ken and i put down a new floor of carpet tiles.&nbsp; and it took a long time, but it looked so damn good when we finished.&nbsp; i really love working there.&nbsp; theres always a sense of pride whenever i finish something, and everyone there is just so fun.&nbsp; and they think of me as like an adult.&nbsp; and as weird as that sounds, like i just feel older there.&nbsp; they all respect me and we all work real well together.&nbsp; 

i was thinking about that today too.&nbsp; im fucking grown up.&nbsp; i drive everywhere now.&nbsp; i have a job.&nbsp; i run the sound board at a hip happening teen center/venue.&nbsp; im a motherfucking senior at my school, and i run that shit.&nbsp; and all the adults i talk to now talk to me like they would normal people.&nbsp; like i was talking to jims mom, and she was telling me serious things while he and matt were screwing around.&nbsp; i just felt mature [not that they are immature, but yeah]

tommarow, is gonna be hectic.&nbsp; school = joke.&nbsp; then a hardcore set up for the meet track practice.&nbsp; then i gotta practice one more time for my show.&nbsp; o yeah, then im performing at the backdoor with my bestest friends.&nbsp; its gonna be so much fun, i really cant wait.&nbsp; i dont even care if i fuck up or if everyone hates it.&nbsp;

"event","so.&nbsp; interesting day.&nbsp; not so much as events, but just what ive thought about.

do you know how many girls have told me, either via text message, myspace, aim, or whatever, that they have feelings for me?&nbsp; a lot.&nbsp; and, every girl who ever had the courage to stand up and spill their heart to me, i just shot down.&nbsp; i just started thinking that that is so mean, and so low; not giving any girl the chance and just saying that i had no feelings for them...it just dosnt seem right.&nbsp; but the sad thing is that i really dont have feelings for really anyone.&nbsp; the problem, i came to, was that i was in love with a girl, for about three years.&nbsp; she lived not close to me, but when i finally had the option and will to drive down to her, she decided to get a boyfriend.&nbsp; which is totally cool, because contrary to popular belief, im not that great nor awesome.&nbsp; so, several problems arise.&nbsp; because prom is coming up, and so far, im stag, and i am really indecisive and i have no eyes for girls around here.&nbsp; at least i dont think i do.&nbsp; because i trained my body well not to feel much, because its only when you care about someone, that they can hurt you.&nbsp; my friend jim would say i could have anyone...but when you have your choice of everyone...it makes it that much harder.&nbsp; dont you just love proms.&nbsp; 

a woman from red cross called me today.&nbsp; she said, you have a very rare blood type.&nbsp; type O negative.&nbsp; she said it would be used on primi babies and could be really helpful and save lives.&nbsp; i said i would look forward to giving blood again and she was very excited and happy.&nbsp; it really brightened up my day.&nbsp; i saw it as a sign; its just another way i can help people and really save people.

i think i might quit track.&nbsp; im really&nbsp; not too sure, but my summer is going to be expensive, and so are the months leading up to it, and after it.&nbsp; so, if i work all the fucking time, i can really save up some money and make it easier on my family and my wallet.&nbsp; im really not that good.&nbsp; i enjoi throwing disk, and hanging out with the people.&nbsp; but its really a giant waste of time, because ill never place, and ill never really accomplish much accept self gain. &nbsp;  sucks.

i feel like schools gonna end any day this week, and then im just gonna leave for college.&nbsp; im not scared, i just feel as though its coming way too soon.&nbsp; im pretty sure ive decided on alfred.&nbsp; just because its bigger and has two or three times more chicks than delhi.&nbsp; [not just chicks, people i mean].&nbsp; five and a half hours away...and i just started to love rockland too.&nbsp; but thats my life.&nbsp; full of irony, and sacrifice...and it couldnt be more interesting.

goodnight friends.&nbsp;

"event","so i awake this morning, exhausted from working two shows and giving blood and everything, and as im drinking some milk, my mom goes, ""you should wash that writing off your windshield."" [it was more of a yell than a statement] and im all like ""theres no writing on my windshield, just the side windows"" *goes outside to read ""MARLA...april fools"" engraved in finger paint on my windshield.*&nbsp; so, whoever did that one will get something back, in a much worse form of punishment.&nbsp; i just have to figure out who dun it, and what im gonna do back.&nbsp; 

so yeah.&nbsp; spring break got kicked off by me working a backdoor show on friday.&nbsp; [yaaa 3wb] [yaaa spaceviel] [yaa jade] [yaaa watching my friends have a good time]. and then saturday i woke up, made sandwiches at St. augustine with melissa, drove to nyack to hand them out, went back to my house to kill time [and watch mulan], gave blood, and then worked the In a can show. [yaaa hardcore night] [yaa lots of fights] [yaa some good bands].&nbsp; and today i did nothing.&nbsp; i wanted to go to work, but i really was too physically tired.&nbsp; so instead, i went shopping with my mom and brother.&nbsp; we went to the library first and i got 10 cds.&nbsp; a bunch o good stuff, and i need it because im gong to visit Alfred state tommarow [ 6 hour drive, kinda] and stay a night there.&nbsp; so i need at least 12 hours of new music.&nbsp; 

speakin of music, this summer should be chock full of it.&nbsp; i plan on going to warped twice, bamboozle, and as many other shows as i possibly can afford.&nbsp; i wanted to go to this rage against the machine/wu tang clan concert, but 100 bucks is too much for one day.

i should really start buckling down tho.&nbsp; i still have to made up lots of work, and get prom stuff all good, graduate, and all that other shit.&nbsp; 

wish me luck.&nbsp; and, if you have an empty spot in your prayers or thoughts, wish my dad even more luck.&nbsp; hes sick and wont much be getting better any time soon.&nbsp; his MS is getting the better of him, and as stubborn and strong as he is, its just a little bit stronger.&nbsp; so, no sympathy, or worrying, just say a prayer or have a thought. thats all i ask.&nbsp; thanks"

friday, school, then i went to work at 1.&nbsp; i love it there and im gonna miss that the most i think when i leave for college.&nbsp; at 5 30 i left for the backdoor.&nbsp; i got to nyack early, so i went down by the water to watch the sun and the water for a couple minutes.&nbsp; pure serenity.&nbsp; went up the show.&nbsp; it was kinda lame, but i always have a good time working them.&nbsp; 

saturday night, i went out to cafe tututango with melissa and friends after they came back from junoir ball.&nbsp; it was a cool place but wicked expensive and very small portions.&nbsp; after that, i got a call and was invited to a party.&nbsp; so i walked to this guys house and i played pong all night and just got so so so so smashed.&nbsp; i dont remember much from the night except being in a bathroom with someone, and then leaving and those two chicks, and then at the diner i kept falling into my hamburger.&nbsp; and there was marker all over my face.

sunday morning was not fun.&nbsp; my first hangover.&nbsp;&nbsp; it was not plesant.&nbsp; my head was exploding for a while, and then i got this kid at opus to get me asperine.&nbsp; the show was cool.&nbsp; L.A. massacre is my new favorite local band.&nbsp; wicked good weekdend.&nbsp; my life is way too crazy

so, yesterday, i decided that i was going to go to jersey and visit my friend kaylee.&nbsp; i had it all planned out..mapquest directions, plenty of change for tolls, extra gas money, a full tank of gas, lunch, my mp3 player and i smelled damn good.&nbsp; right before im about to leave...o, and i didnt ask or tell my parents, because they would have said no and its just way to much pain, so instead i told them i was going to study for physics at my friends house, which i could have really used, but whatever, so right before im about to leave, my dads like...""you know that tree in the back yard, its dying, go cut some branches off of it.""&nbsp; so that took 40 minutes and then i had to change becasue i had woodchips everywhere, [even in my underwear].&nbsp; so, i shortly left and was on my way.&nbsp; about an hour into driving, im lost in new jersey.&nbsp; the mapquest directions were very wrong, and i had to make many stops and ask many people how to get to south bound brook.&nbsp; no one really helped.&nbsp; and at one point i got really frustraited and just got off the highway and found a parking lot, took out a map and started looking that way.&nbsp; three minutes later, a car pulls up near me, i go over to it to ask for some directions, and it turns out that this guy is also lost.&nbsp; the parking lot of lost people we called it.&nbsp; so this guy was chill, damian was his name, and we both looked at my map and helped each other find out where we were going.&nbsp; very cool.&nbsp; half hour later, im cruising down 287 and i reach my destination.&nbsp; 

it was so great seeing that girl.&nbsp; cant put it into words.&nbsp; so after a while of chilling with her family, which is huge, and after watching the wizard of oz [thats what her little sister had to watch] we got to chill out.&nbsp; and then later, her family took me out to dinner.&nbsp; very awesome.&nbsp; 7 30 rolled around, and i had to leave.&nbsp; i reprinted some mapquest directions because the ones i had were obviously bad and i was off.&nbsp; about a half hour into the trip, i came to this road and mapquest said to stay left, but i knew i had to go straitght.&nbsp; but i had to listen to the damn mapquest. half hour later, im in pennsulvania.&nbsp; luckily, the toll guy put me in the right direction and i was off.&nbsp; but 9 was rapidly approaching and i had to make the call to my mom and tell her the truth and that i was gonna be late.&nbsp; o man...it was bad.

so, thank god for my map, other wise id still be in jersey.&nbsp; i got home at like 10 30 after getting lost again.&nbsp; and my family and i got in a big fight.&nbsp; they were totaly right and i was wrong, i know that, but it was kinda worth it.&nbsp; i also did something ive never done before, i yelled at my dad and he almost punched me in the face.&nbsp; that coulda been bad.&nbsp; but he took away my car and my mom took away my guitars, but hey, she was worth it.&nbsp; and so was the hamburger from fridays.&nbsp; mmm.&nbsp; like an hour after the fight my parents were just acting normal agian..weirdos.&nbsp; and today, my dad told me to take his car and go pick up something.&nbsp; i find it funny, because im not supposed to drive my car , but i can take his?&nbsp; haha..my life is rediculous.&nbsp; and i love and hate every minute of it.&nbsp; haha. i should write books.&nbsp; enjoi"

the worst part is that im really angry&nbsp; most of the time.&nbsp; the reason being is that i couldnt play football and that usually helped my anger issue, but since i couldnt this year, its still all inside me, i guess.&nbsp; which sucks, cuz i really dont like being angry, but people just keep pissing me off, or just being fucking stupid.&nbsp; i wont even get started with that.&nbsp; stupid people should not breed.

later that day, jim came over, played guitar hero, and then jordan came over, and i owned him in guitar hero.&nbsp; we then went on a quest to get some of his stuff.&nbsp; we wound up at the mall and i wound up buy four bags of candy corn and a japenese movie that i love [Battle Royal..i doubt youve heard of it].&nbsp; went back to jimmies watched we watched the movie and ate the candycorn.&nbsp; but before we did that, jorden locked his keys in his car.&nbsp; being the idiots we are, we just walked away and figured wed get it open later.&nbsp; 9 30 rolls around and i persuade them that we should try to get it open.&nbsp; jordan started calling people and jimmy was looking for hangers..while i cut a hole in the weather stripping and figured out how to put something into his car.&nbsp; so i ran to jess's house, stole a hanger, unbent it and eventually got it in, hit the unlock button and danced in the streets.&nbsp; it was glorius.

"event","<div class=""ljcut"">its not even 10 am, and today already sucks ball.<br /><br />my football game got moved from 1 pm, to 4 pm. and its no longer home, its away. which sucks, because i wanted to be home and i wanted it to be ealier.&nbsp; but none of that really matters cuz i still cant play.&nbsp; and i was supposed to help my dads friend help cater a yacht club dinner, but now i have to stay at the damn game.<br /><br />and im missing out on a lot of things.&nbsp; im just noticing, that a lot of shit is going down with my friends and stuff, and i cant be around to help or just hang out because im so fuckin busy, and it sucks.&nbsp; i hear how upset they are in voicemails, and i couldnt do anything cuz i had to work.&nbsp; im lettin people down. and speakin of people, i just found that two chicks were like hardcore leading me on.&nbsp; its totally fine, but it just kinda adds to the suckyness.<br /><br />but there are some things still good, i think<br />i still got my beat up out of tune six string<br />i still got my friends who i only see in school<br />i like control the backdoor<br />and i still have my fading memory</div>
<p>ok, so this day started out shitty, but it got great all threw the day.</p>
<p>yeah, the game got moved, but it was awesome.&nbsp; we beat suffern 20 to 0, and i may not be able to play yet, but when i do, im gonna mess up so many people.</p>
<p>after the game, we went back to the school and had a big meal thing, and i ate a rediculous amount, and then messed with little kids.</p>
<p>after all the food and fun, i went home, and then went out and did some stuff, and it was just awesome.&nbsp; there were no clouds in the sky and you could see so many stars. and the weather is perfect. o, and i rode down germonds , where it crosses 304, on my scooter.&nbsp; it was so fast and i almost got hit by a car..and it was amazing. it was a good night.</p>
<p>o, and the best news of all.&nbsp; my buttons for my band came. finnaly.&nbsp; they all look nice and its just so awesome.</p>
<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so the morel off the story is, dont count your chickens in the morning, because the day could always get better as it goes on.<br /></p>"

""but pat, you cant do much, why would u go to the camp""  because im crazy and love my team and i can still run. but no hitting. please heal quicker fifth medacarple.

"event","shits been going down.

yesterday i broke my right hand.  the fifth medacarple is split in two, but should heal correctly.  my parents were arguing hardcore and i got really angry and upset. so i was gonna punch a wall, but that would have made a large noice and or hole, so i chose my leg.  wound up at the emergency room and a cute nurse gave me a splint.

today i spent like 7 and a half hours at the mall.  but i did get to meet marionella from FUSE and jodi sweetin from full house [i freaked her out with my spint].  sugarcult played some acustic songs and im gonna be on tv next week.  watch fuse and look for the get malled tour.  look for the kid in the HORSE the band shirt with a splint giving a thumbs up.

and a few hours ago, there was this wicked sweet backdoor meeting, with tuns of food and nice people.  thats all i wanted to say."

"event","hey.  im back, and figure id tell you of my journies.

jersey was nice.  atlantic city was kindof a dump, but ocean city had some nice beaches and some good looking people there.  nothing really happened, except for i got a really cool sun burn.  it says Super Rad on my back.  and then we went to IHOP on the last day, and it was the best meal all week.

i came back, cleaned my clothes, and then after my parents went to sleep, i chilled with becca for an hour, and then jimmy for a couple more.  it was an awesomely random night filled with adventure.  and then Bj and Tommy Hetric gave me a ride home, at like 4 am.  it was wacky.

then i woke up, went to alexs house and went to Ozzfest.  it was kinda lackluster, but still awesome and metal filled.  there were no merch tables, but there was a clown insulting people.  and a guy wiht a shirt that said ""Pits, Tits, and Midgets"", which is now my phone banner.  and there was a crippled guy in a wheel chair, who was really freakin drunk who jumped in a mosh pit..he was the most hardcore guy ive ever seen.  the show was kinda gay tho, cuz they had each stage in two parts; if you had a wrist band, you got close, and if you were like us and everyone else, you were farther away.  so for all the second stage bands, we were far away.  but then as Ozzy came on, we heard rumor that if you waited in front of the main stage, you could get a wrist band.  so, we waited close to two hours, sweating on strangers and we all finnaly got one.  we were mad close and i got some sweet pix of DragonForce, Disturbed and SOAD.  and being real close meant that we were close to the pits, and i finnaly got to go in and fuck things up.  except during the pit for Hatebreed, i was in a circle pit and i was running and i triped and skid on my knee and foot and it still hasnt healed.  whatever.  it was an awesome day.

the next day, i left for warwick.  it was a great week, and i saw a lot of awesome people that i really missed, except it was so god damned hot from monday until thursday.  nothing too crazy happened, which was kind of a let down, but i still wouldnt trade it for anything.  i played some hardcore games of soccer and football, which was nice.  and i got to see kaylee. and she bought me a whole bunch of pirate stuff from florida, cuz shes the coolest. and then friday rolled around realy quick and i left in the middle of a soccer tournament, but my team was winning [cuz i didnt let any goals in [yeah patick as goalie]].

the ride home was kinda nervewracking, cuz i knew i had my show coming up.  and then when my phone decided to start working, i started getting really paniced phone calls saying that our drummer and guitarist went to Florida.  but luckily they found replacements.  i got home, showered, changed and then went to nyack.  my friends bands were really good like BOATC and franks band.  but..we didnt do so well.  our drummer played everything wrong, but he only had two days of practice..and miligram filled in at guitar, and did pretty well.  but, the freakin drums screwed me up so bad.  and then we ran out of time, but we played our last song anyway, but he cut us off.  it was really sad.  i just kinda walked out of the place and around nyack for a while right after.  and then i came back any my mom yelled at me cuz shes just a bitch.  she went off to dinner and i met up with all the band mates and we just kinda chilled.  

eventually, we all kinda left, and i just changed my clothes to avoid embarassment, and then went inside and listened to some good bands.  FIKUS HAD NEW SONGS.  and 3MNB was pretty cool.  and i really like the NAked Citizens, cuz me and these chicks were skankin around this guy who wouldnt get up from his chair.  it was funny.  my brother and i left soon after and then i was gonna go out again, but i was tired..so thats that.

thanks everyone who was at my show.  it means a lot.  next summer, or as soon as the college kids come back, well have a better rehearsed awesome show, with cds, buttons, and t shirts for sale.  and you will all be amazed at how good we really are, because that show on friday, was not us.  trust me.  whatever, ill see yall around. ciao"

"event","hmm.  fun stuff coming up.  tommarow is work at the carpet store, then work at the backdoor, then party at lindseys.  i travel on my scooter cuz its fast. saturday im seeing priscilla at nikkis and im gonna try to see clerks II.  sunday packing and seeing justin.  monday morning is paine, but after that i leave with my family for jersey.  were chilling there for a week, on the beaches and boardwalks. should be fun. we stay there till friday, we come back. and then saturday is Ozzfest with Matt.  should fucking rock.  Then i leave the next day and go to my camp in Warwick, where i get to see a bunch of old friends and kaylee, which will just leave me speechless. then on that friday, i leave camp a little early so i can come back up and play the show at the backdoor.  its gonna be risky, but with some quick practicing before the show, we should be solid.  if you can, be there, cuz that would mean a lot to me.  its probably our last show for a while, because everyone is going to college, except me and becca.  suckers. then after that, ill maybe go to Warped if i can convice my parents..not too likey, but it could happen.  and then football comes into full swing, and that will end my summer.

to sum up: im leaving for two weeks on monday, and ill be back to play the show, which id like to see all of you at.  thats all.

im in a weird mood.  and i dont like it.  and i miss a lot of my friends.  and i have to fight leah.  with her kicks.  and my guitar sounds awesome.  its out of tune, but it still rocks out.  thanks costco.  alright..enough. goodnight friends"

"event","hmmm.  i was thinking.  which is never good.

im thinking about a life of celibacy.  because i hate being lied to, and thats what happens in the relationships i go into, or lack or relationships. 

and ive been kinda/really angry recently.  so i guess its not so bad that my moms making me go to a pyhciatrist tommarow.  whatever, if hes a chill guy, ill use him, but if hes a fossil, ill give em hell.  waste of money, but when has my mom ever listened to me.  

tonight, i went to Rye Playland with my family, Jimmy, and Diyars little brother.  we had a good time and i went on all the hardcore rides and got soaked in the log flume.  and i bought the picture from it cuz i looked all retarted.  it was so fucking hot.  like i was standing at one point, not moving or anything, and i just started sweating.  it was gross.  and the starship 2000 is so much fun.  and my dad is so crazy, and always likes to bring up bad things at a fun time, but hes still my idol and hes just the coolest.  whos also loseing his mind, and legs.  stay strong pop.

i wish this summer was normal.  i wish it just went like summers should go.  but one night of fun can change a lot.  haha..fucking kids.  and i cant take a life of celibacy...ill be letting down chicks everywhere..haha..not, but i definitly wouldnt be able to live that way.  i give in too easy, and succom to things.  push over.  and ive decided that i hate my phone and talking on it.  texting is so much cooler anyway."

"event","ok, so last night i got to go to Sounds of the Underground in Poughkeepsie wiht Matt and Alex [because i basically guilted my parents into it] and it was fucking amazing.  the bands were insane and so were the pits.  and i got pretty  messed up, but it was worth it.  in the first ten minutes i was there, i got punched in the face. not bad. the worst is my knee, which is still rediculously swolen. wait, lemme check...o yeah. its huge. dont fall down in pits, because people will fall on you and crush you into the floor.  and make sure you eat too, not eating for an entire day isnt healthy. and bring a big roll of duct tape...it comes in handy.

god i love metal shows.  and dude, i met three bands.  and got stuff signed.  i met As I Lay Dying, Trivium, and motherfucking HORSE the Band.  we had to leave before AILD came on, but Trivium was awesome and Horse rocked, and they were all really chill dudes.  other good bands that you should possibly check out [if you enjoi rocking out and throwing your neck around] are Terror, Cannibal Corpse, and Black Dahlia Murder.  And we almost had to miss In Flames, but matts mom got stuck in trafic...o yeah, very lucky.  And then there was GWAR.  you have to see them to belive em, and i got drenched in colored liquids and it was gross. kitty. the whole crowd got just soaked. and it smelled too.  at the end of the night, i reaked of costume shop, sweat, weed, and gasoline. but when i got home i took a much needed shower and i was nolonger smelly or blue.

i had goals and i completed them.  i danced to Cutsman by horse the band, i didnt spend a lot of money [only $17], and stayed in the pits for a looong time.  good night, and way too much fun."

""yeah"" ""well.., he killed himself last week.""

"event","ah..the fouth of july.  it sucks and i dislike america. just wanted to make that clear.  there might be a lot of spelling or other errors cuz im still not totaly sober. anywho, on monday, i went to congers with jimmy to see fireworks, and it was good for the most port.  and then tuesday, i went to rachels house for a bit, then to zweigs house for swimming and fireworks and other thigs.  the pool was nice, and we left during the fireworks, and the other thing wasnt what i thought it would be.  whatever.  if she wants to just use me for the summer, i think that wouldnt bother me too much.  um, and yeah, the fourth really sucked. my family came over and ate food and i locked myself in my room with my guitar thw whole day.  

and today, a good friend of mine was having a bad day, so she came over and we finished off my stash and then some.  god i love taquila.  we watched robin hood and then i think we watched shrek, but i really dont remember shrek.  i was laughing too hard and just fucking fallin all over the place.  until i got sick and threw up in my bathroom for a while.  i hate taquila.  i think i passed out after that and she left around then.  but the moral of the story is that alcohol only covers up problems for a while, or until your sober again.  they are still gonna be there and drinking really isn t the best way to avoid or forget about  a problem.  damn it hard to type.  if anyone is ever having a problem, you can always come to me and ill do my best to help, because alcohol can only do so much.  feel better babe."

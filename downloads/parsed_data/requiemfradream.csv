"event","suprisingly good mood for being sick all week and only get about 5 hours of sleep last night. With all my free time this morning i sat down with my acoustic because we had some serious catching up to do, and I had a great reminder of how much fun it is to learn new songs..

This vacation has been pretty lame, considering everybody left for some exotic location, and I've been sitting at home sick, but oh well. I work the gilford skate park today from 12-9 and tomorrow 12-6, and I cant wait to make some money and help out the park. Now its time to get back to my guitar.............."

"event","What a waste of a weekend! 
friday was the lock in, which I knew would suck, but was blown away at the level of boredom I achieved. Somehow I still managed to stay up all night, then went to GP's in the morning to start my day of nothing. I went skating then came home and passed out. Today I'm going to do some cleaning in my porch/ downstairs area. Basically its this kickass room in my basement but its screened in and looks out over the lake, with stairs leading to my dock. It would be great except over the winter it was destroyed and I need to clean it, but it'll be great once its finished. But now is guitar time because I'm bored as hell"

Also wondering why this week was so horrible, and why in the past 2 life went from simple and slightly boring to dramatic and so confusing. I'm not a huge fan of the bitching lj entries, and im wondering why im making one. 
One last one, why is it that i allowed myself to be so disillusioned as to think that you were worth  even a small fraction of my time?"

Offered me $250 for guitar and case, which i paid 600 for just a few months ago.

Really all i want is some CD's and another acoustic guitar for all those alternate tunings and blah blah blah.

Here are a few examples of places I'd rather be:

I would even settle for Laconia or Gilford, perhaps Plymouth.

"event","well seeing as i had no school today, steve decided to skip so we could drive around and shit. We woke up around 8 30 or something, and drove to meredith and jumped the fence to the park. It sucked though, cause it was all wet and i hit my head, so we left. Next we drove to gilford high school to mock the kids who had to be in school.then we drove around the airport, driving along the airplane take off stretch, and then checked out the new indoor park next to the movie theatre. That'll be dope when it opens, good set up. So then we drove to surf coaster and jumped the fence to skate some stairs we saw, but had to run from some asshole who was in there. and uhh...went to pirates cove to play mini golf with our skateboards. fun day so far...hopefully tonight will be just as good"

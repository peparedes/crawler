"event","<font style=""font-size: 11px"">OMGWTF?! A POST THAT ISN'T ANGSTY?!?!?!?! OMGYES. An idealist reborn and an idiot nonetheless. I patched things up with that certain person, reignited most of the band, wrote and compiled four new songs, and totally like, became awesome. If that makes any sense. It may just be my egotistical ranting. Either way, I'm feeling damn good.

The days are looking good. The skies are looking good. My friends are looking good. And hell, even I'm looking good. I can't get out of this oh-so-optimistic mood that has me entranced. And I'm listening to Thought Riot once again, this time ""On Friends and Mistakes"", a song that really well summed up some of my feelings over the past week or so. I'm such a mood-swinging bastard, aren't I?

So like, joy to the world, peace and good will towards men (and women), and a signed copy of Shattered Mirror Syndrome, including exclusive Thought Riot patch, for all!</font>"

"event","<font style=""font-size: 11px"">A question I ask myself nearly every day now. It seems like my efforts were out of boredom as a motivation more than they should have been. I've caught the apathy bug once again and can't shake it. I'm completely losing my motivation to go out and improve the world and improve myself. I can't get over how much of an ass I was to one of my oldest friends a few days ago. The band is still on hiatus. I can't even fucking transform my feelings into song format. I'm losing all motivation to do anything. Within a month or so's time, I'll even be leaving high school forever. What the hell am I supposed to do now? I've hit the greatest roadblock of my entire life. Even running is becoming less enjoyable by the day and now more of a chore than a good time. 

I can't focus on anything, either. Today I had to go through two horrendously easy finals. Or at least, they would have been that easy had I not been so incredibly out of focus. I can't even focus on philosophy anymore, so how the hell am I expected to complete some complex report on Hume within days? How am I supposed to revamp my band? How the hell am I supposed to do anything that involves getting off my lazy ass? Motivation has been sucked from my body. I'm lifeless, loveless, and careless. ALl of which equal my worst possible state of mind: Apathetic and Moody. Which in turn mixes into one hell of a nasty cocktail.

Oh yeah, and no Thought Riot today. My listening streak ended Tuesday morning. Gash now has my complete attention.</font>"

"event","<font style=""font-size: 11px"">Guess what I did today? Yep, listened to Thought Riot all day. The song of choice today seems to be ""A Song in Response to..."", which I can't remove from my head after today's 10+ hours of listening to just it. And I've memorized the words and can imitate Marc's voice to the highest note on it now. What do you know? Should I be labeled a fanboy now? Or later? Doesn't matter anyway. Thought Riot rocks and that's all that matters here.

And I tried to go through an entire day being positive, and it didn't seem to do too much of anything for me. Ya know? I don't really know how people get off like they do on being so positive all the time. And the majority of the time it's like they have repressed feelings of guilt and/or sadness inside that needs to be let out. Something I discovered today in the form of a friend. For now this friend will be unknown, but I'll call her ""Sally"" Now Erica, erm, I mean ""Sally"" has pretty much been the epitome of positivity and happiness since I met her just before the school year started up. And she was damn cute all the time too, but that shouldn't matter. 

Fact is, today she totally broke down when we were talking about hiding oneself. She was surprisingly philisophical one, too. But once again, that shouldn't matter. When I said something along the lines of ""Anyone totally faking themselves out has got to be an idiot. I just don't see how I could have respect for actions like that."" she totally broke down. It was the most emotional scene I had watched in months. And it moved me. Now you must think ""Pshaw! That bastard Kou could never be emotionally moved."" but it's all too true. I struck a chord that I shouldn't have struck and it seemingly has costed me dearly. As it turns out, she had repressed depression and emotional problems that she had been working through for a few months, and I sat there completely blanked out and unknowing what to say for about four minutes of silence. And what did I say to break the silence ""You know what? I think I'm gonna leave now."" You fucking idiot Kouketsu.</font>"

"event","<font style=""font-size: 11px"">Another day of non-stop Thought Riot. I've been going to sleep every night on ""The Hermit of Sils Maria"" and having it play throughout the entire day. Think I'm kidding? It's no joke. The album has been playing nonstop throughout the entire day and I have yet to stop listening to them for quite a long time....A bit too long if you ask me. But you know me, ""Mr. Cool and Sane and Not Crazy or Obsessive or anything near it Because that wouldn't make me look good.""

And the band's on hiatus now. My head feels like it's been ripped off my shoulders, trampled upon, shot at, and then eaten with a delectable hot sauce that makes you want to shoot fire comically from your ears while screaming ""Yeowza!"" I can't think straight, let alone memorize songs and write lyrics. And my personalized Hawk is still sitting on the guitar stand...doing nothing. 

Nostalgia hits and I become a fucking moody piece of garbage, excuse my language. Or you know what? Don't excuse it. I feel the need to fucking cuss out every fucking word out of my fucking system, just to clear my head. Or maybe it's the Thought Riot listening doing this to me? Nah, it can't be. It's never Thought Riot. They're just too good.

"event","<font style=""font-size: 11px"">I swear, I've to have to most boring, quality-lacking live journal in existence. And for good reason, too. Or maybe not good reason. Apathy's gotten to me like a fucking disease that just won't go away. I know I'm feeling lazy and not wanting to do anything, but over the past few days I really haven't done anything for the equality cause, nor for the band and it's taking it's toll on me. It seems I've gone back to the sleep-run-eat schedule of days past. It's killin' me though. And then there's still that whole ""OMG-I-HAVE-NO-REASON-TO-WAKE-UP-ANYMORE-CAUSE-NOTHING-WILL-CHANGE"" thing, but that's actually not so bad, considering sleep has been my best friend recently. 

Then there's the whole love problem I've experienced all too well lately. As I had mentioned in posts' past, there is such a gaping hole right now, which is most likely the largest cause of my lack of motivation and apathy. I just wish I'd have been rejected at least once back in the old days, that way this wouldn't hurt so fucking much.

And I've been listening to Thought Riot for 26 hours straight, even through every hour of school. I've gone through four battery changes in my CD player already, too. The Gibson Hawk has yet to even be used, but it most likely won't be anyway. It'll sit there and remind why I do what I do. Although I'm technically not doing it now. Can I ever have a post without problems?"

"event","<font style=""font-size: 11px"">Another wasted day, another wasted chance at doing something good for myself or someone else. Meh. Football playoff season has still been keeping me indulged, and now basketball season is really heating up, and my beloved T-Wolves are doing exceptional. 

Beyond all that sports talk though, my message of equality still remains one of lackluster quality, yet continues to enumerate in people by the day. Others are now realizing the goodness in people and attempting to lend a helping hand in ending all the hate and whatnot in the world. Idealist is such a perfect title for me now. And the band things continues to grow better by the day. I've completely shut out almost all other hobby distractions and the like, and video games and anime have taken a backseat to my cause. Could I sound like more of an idiot right now? I doubt it, but I sure as hell don't feel like one.

"event","<font color=""#000000"" style=""font-size: 11px"">Wow. Yet another lame-ass day. And yet I bother to make another lame-ass entry. Well, band thing is still charging forward, and somehow taking my mind off my love-less state, which has left a void in my personality worse than the plague. Hopefully that won't last too long though, 'cause I'm just such a little emotional sweetie waiting for another chance sometime. Although that'd be quite hard with your past two relationships living thousands of miles away. But life deals me that hand once again, and after tossing out queen for my royal flush chance, I get instead an eight and end up with two fucking pair. And yet again with my detailed analogies. That one didn't even sound right, either. Just some rambling about a lost card game. But I guess that's just what my life is. A lost card game. (He shoots for a good ending metaphor....and he scores!)

"event","<font style=""font-size: 11px"" color=""#000000"">It seems I have officially become an idealist, wannabe activist hippie-fag. Or at least according to those always-right skateboarders harassing some kids today I am. Hah. Equality has suddenly become an ideal and no longer a possibility. The masses can't seem to keep their hands off the controversy. Oh well. I'm supposed to be the whole ""I-don't-care-I'm-so-punk type, so I guess I shouldn't be caring. Problem is, I do. New Years seems to have changed me for the better, the band thing's going well, and now we're using it as a method of promoting equality now. The very local single ""Stop the Hate"" seems to actually be spreading just a bit too, which is a good thing also. The days seem numbered and the skies seem far too black in the coming weeks, so I guess that means when this bastard returns to school, some jocks will snap him out of his ""idealistic wannabe activist hippie-fag"" stage.</font>"

Betcha didn't see that one comin'! Didja?! Didja?!?!?! I have got to get off the kool-aid sometime soon. It's killin' more brain cells than that time my brother repeatedly slapped me with a picture frame. But I'll save that erotic story for yet another day. My body aches now and I feel incredibly sick, which would be the first time in months, possibly even years. Coughing and sneezing and getting incredibly hot. Well, that last one has always cursed me. Anyway, I type in complete sickness looking at a moon that I really don't desire to see. Uh oh. My moody and emotional side seems to be slipping through the cracks in the side of my arm once again. 

But seriously folks, life isn't too great now. I never knew how much ""feelin' down"" could suck. But then again, I'm just a whiner.</font>"

Well, today sucked. The day before that sucked also, but today did more by a small margin considering my Vikings lost. And in the most sickening display I have ever seen. On a 4th and 25. With 5 seconds left. Against the 2nd worst team in the NFL. And the catch is made in the corner of the endzone. After two flawless sacks. Wow, I can't help but feel that the Vikings should have won that game hands down, so much so that I'm prompted to rant on it here. Anyway, I now have a firm disliking for football after that and I'll have to start gettin' back to the whole band thing. You know what that means. Ladies will be all over me once again.</font>"

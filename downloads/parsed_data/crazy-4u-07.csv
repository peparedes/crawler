Its horriable like for some reason yesterday and the day before i was a real bitch to alot of people and yes i appoligize. I just wish i could figure out whats the matter with me so i could be happy again. But i think i know one reason why im sad. I think its cause Curt isnt in school right now and he always makes my days 10X better. Well without him its so much harder to go on. There probablly multiple reasons to why i am down right now but i cant put it a name too it. I just cant wait till this week is over with ya know.
But anyways right now im trying to think of a method to get me through the week in one peice. I almost was about to break down last night but i got through it. Thats all i feel like talking about.

"event","Hmmm where to start. Well first off this week has personally been the best for me. I mean i cant even begin to explain how good it has been. But dont get me wrong it hasnt been all that wonderful though. Your always going to have someone or something ruining yout great mood! Yeah well this week has been just so drama filled. I have no idea either. Alot of it has to deal with cheerleading. Blahhhhh....
Well ok let me start so as most of you know theres competitve conditiong well some of the girl are going to that because there intrested in that team. No biggie right? Well our sideline team isnt even over yet and it seems like the girls that are going to that team are already throwing in the towel and giving up. I mean i have or had so much faith in that team and it seems like there letting the girls who arent going to competitve down. (thanks ladies. NOT) Another problem is one of my friends not mentioning names was telling me one of the girls on my team are already getting a big head about competitve and baisclly assuming that shes going to make it.  She also told me that was she saying mean things about my other friend. Apperntaly shes been having problems at school to and than what she said didnt make it any better. So i had told my friend what was being said about her since it dealt with her and there were i belive 3 other girls around at the time. So this girl heard the rumor and came up to me at the game yesterday and started asking me why i was saying this stuff about her. I tryed explaing it to her but it seemed like everything i was saying she was taking the complete and uter oppisite so i asked her to stay after so i could talk to her and of course she didnt. Well anyways today we had practice and she was ignoring me and such. So i wanted to appoligize to her for w/e was wrong. Plus life is to short to hold grudges against everyone. So i tryed talking to her and she blew me completly off. Finally i went up to her and she baisclly didnt even give me the time of day to listen to what i had to say. Which i think is so rude. Shes being a lil bitch to everyone, even the coaches. Shes just taking everything way over board. She doesnt even want to come to the banquet because its the first comeptive practice. when people who were also there were telling her the coaches said they could miss practice. so shes baisiclly assuming shes going to make it. So today i just broke down and cried at practice. Not over this girl but just because all this drama.
Honestly im just so sick and tired of this. All i want is it to end. Wheres the team that i used to love? Beacause i know its there. I just want to make the last game the best because i may not be on a team w/some of the girls for the rest of my time here. I dont know but i just want one fucking week to be good and not just one damn day. I just dont know anymore. I just dont and thats pathetic....

Oh and whos ever telling that shit to you know who needs to stop. Because obusiouly i dont trust you anymore and im not going to be confiding in you so you just need to grow up. Ok? thanks

Curt Joseph Rogers Yeah im in love with you.

"event","Yeah so lets see i havn't updated in a really long time. Hm school today was very stressful! It stills makes me upset just to think about it. I honestly have no idea whats wrong with me lately. Im just so emotional, like all the time i feel like i want to break down and cry for the stupidest reasons. I dont tell my friends or my significant others my probelms because i dont want to bore them w/my problems. Im just ready to give up all togeather, call it quits. School is deff. paying its toll on me and its giving me so much problems.

Im just glad that i do have my wonderful boyfriend here for me. He's always there when i need to vent. I love him very much for that. He's such an amazing person ecspically as a b/f. I dont know how he could put up w/all my shit, but he does. Words just cant even explain how much im greatful that were going out or how much he does for me. Curt i adore you more than life itself babe.

He makes me smile like non stop and I just know i can always trust him no matter what. I know im in love. Theres just no better explenation for the way i feel for him. And i love it. 
Next off Alex as you all now still loves me. And to be honest hes so fucking dumb. Its very clear that im going out with Curt but he just doesnt get it and i dont want to be mean and yell at him because i do want to be friends with him. But he just doesnt get it.
I joined JV recently and i absloutly leave it. specially my stunt group. Maddy, shorty, and jen! You girls are awsome. Well so is the rest of the team to but i specially love them girls though.

"event","Ok so lately i've noticed that everyone always talks down about there boyfriends. I mean i just don't understand it. You say you love someone than you have the nerve to talk shit about them. I mean no guy is perfect, no matter how sweet or nice they are. No guy is perfect. But instead of complaining about how you want this perfect guy to come along and sweep you off your feet, you just have to take the imperfect guy make him perfect. And another thing that bothers me, is when you have a boyfriend that you say you love your not supposed to look at other guys. Its just wrong and if you really loved your boyfriend you wouldn't look at other guys.
I mean i love my boyfriend, he's absloutly amazing. Noone sersiously could compare to him. He's great. Hes always there for me and i couldn't ask for any better.
Anyways my parents finally agreed to let me get my lesince right after i take segement 2 if i want too. Im like holy crap what's wrong with my parents?!? And than today i came home and my mom bought me a whole bunch of things. Im like wow this is weird. well i don't really know what else to talk about. Lata Gangstas

"event","So i havn't really updated in a while so i'll update now while i have the time. Well lately it seems like everyone is ""depressed"". I just don't understand it can't anyone just be happy. Everyone just mopes around and complains how much life sucks and how they don't know where they want to go in life. Im just sick of hearing it. I'm sorry people but life is too short so GET OVER IT! 
Another thing is lately i've really found out who really cares about me and who are truly my friends and who aren't my friends. I mean i just can't wait for summer, its going to be GREAT! Someone that i'm really greatful that's in my life is Curt. He's always there for me and he supports me in what i want to do. Hopefully were togeather for a while, i mean i know i say that alot but somethings diffrent about him. I mean theres just so many things i feel for him i just can't put it into words and maybe thats somesort of sign. Some other loves that have made me happy are N.C cross, kay, angie, d-tri, lemony,Heather,John and many many more.
I really don't know what else to talk about. I mean life's pretty good, my job is fun i guess met LOTS of new people. People i actualy like (elise, trish, marcus, chris, james) i also filled out an app to Forever 21 maybe i'll get an interview there. That would be pretty cool. Hmmmm well i'm fresh out Gangsters. Love you all

Well ::clears throat:: first of all we had a team sleep over at alania's house, which was totally awsome. We all had so much fun and we all bonded. It was great, i couldn't of asked for a better cheer team in the world. I love you ladies. I wont forget people writing all over everyone, and the lovely singing at 4:30 in the morning, and calling boys all night. 
Second i guess now were taking over varsity's postion and we get to go to districts and cheer. So our season isn't exactlly over yet.
Last but not least, i've learned Justin is down right awful, hes a stupid skank bag and i think he deserves to be treated like one. And i've moved on. I already have my eye on a few people. But you know what do u expect when Justin acts gay he gets exactlly what he deserves.

""I love you, i am who i am because of you. You are every reason, every hope, and every dream I've ever had, and no matter what happens to us in the future, everyday we are to togeather is the greatest day of my life. I will always be yours.
And darling you will always be mine.""

""I am yours, my queen, my timeless beauty. You are and always have been, the best thing in my life.""

"event","""Poets often describe love as in emotion that we can't control, one that overwhelms logic and common sense. That's what it was like for me. I didn't plan on falling in love with you, and i doubt if you planned in falling in love with me. But once we met, it was clear that neither of us could control what was happening to us. We fell in love, despite our diffrences, and once we did, something rare and beautiful was created. For me love like that has happened only once, and that's why every minute we spent togeather has been in my memory. I'll never forget a single moment of it.""

"event","Well this week is break so i dont have to see school until wedensday. YES!! Yesterday was quite funny. We as in the cheerleaders were sitting on the bus waiting for all of the basketball players to get on when all of a sudden to guys from Dearborn got on the bus and started telling us there numbers and and s/ns and telling us to memorize them. All of us were shouting for them to get off of the bus but instead they were opening up all of the windows. Eventually they got off the bus. But it was extremly funny.
Other than that  3 months for me and Justin was Thursday. You know i couldn't have asked for a better boyfriend. He's absloutly wonderful, and i love him so much. I wouldn't trade in the past 3 months for anything. I hope were togeather for a long time. I bet your jelous that i got the best boyfriend ever.

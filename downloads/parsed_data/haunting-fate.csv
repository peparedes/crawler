"event","lets see i wake up late to only rush out the door forgetting everything i need...on the bus look at my phone it says ""1 new voice mail"" so i listened to it...its britt saying she wants to talk to me about something....my stomach turned over... got to school and ran to her locker to catch her...i catch her put my hand on her hip and lean into to kiss her and she says no....so i ask her what she wanted to talk about she hesittated and got nervous then says i need space, some time to figure shit out...dont worry i still love you and theres no one else i just need time...she hugged me and left.

so the rest of the day was me holding back tears thinking of all the fun shit...realizing i had no money for lunch no snack and i had work so i still havent eaten...it just feels so horrible to have all these feelings for no one now...its like turning on a flashlight when the lights are on

i got homework to do and shit to think about

i dont feel like typing it again so im going to show the message i hhad with a friend of mine so justlook for the parts i wrote (KillHateandDie16)

KillHateandDie16: well it srated when we went to warped tour...at the end brittany got a ciggarette from joey and started smoking and it surprised and grossed me out and tyhen she said she was sorry but her life is super streesed out right now which it is. then like a week later she came to see me at work and she reiked like that gross cig smell and i told her and she got all upset and cryed and apologized and said she'd quit. so like a week and a half later we were hangin out and talkin and she slipped and reveialed she still was and then i got upset because she lied and broke a promise and she said she was down to five and that was it....and i told her that i had full faith in her and then it was good she wrote me this letter that said how she was stopping she doesnt want to do anything that upsets me....then tonight we were on the phone and her mom left and she lit up another one and i could hear it and i was like are you? and she said no and kept deniing it and then i told her i couldnt beleive she was lieing to my face and she confessed
KillHateandDie16: then there was silence and she asked why i was upset and i told her because i felt betrayed and heart broken 
KillHateandDie16: then she hung up on me
KillHateandDie16: so i called her back like 13 times crying on her answering machine how sorry i was and stuff
StarIffer: im srry but what a btch im pissed she lied o ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
KillHateandDie16: and then i called one last time and caity (fitzpatrick) picked up and said britts not talking she needs time to vent and how im wrong because i need to accept what shes doing
StarIffer: i hate caity
KillHateandDie16: dont say that
StarIffer: oo this makes me mad!!!

KillHateandDie16: so jenn uhm what should i do....be pissed because she lied or me sorry because i made her upset
KillHateandDie16: because im feeling both
KillHateandDie16: and im getting really dizzy
StarIffer: no dont be srry she lied!!!
KillHateandDie16: i shouldnt have told you because now i broke a promise but i had to talk to some one
KillHateandDie16: ....now im more upset
StarIffer: promise?
KillHateandDie16: im gonna be sick
StarIffer: dont be sick...plez
KillHateandDie16: yeah she made me promise i wouldnt tell anyone

I have such strong feelings for brittany that makes it semm unreal, its something from a disney movie but better and everyone wants to rip it apart its not right at all........i support everyone with their relationships but when i ask for i get crap............sounds awesome right?

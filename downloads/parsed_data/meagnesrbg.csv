"event","In the last 2 years I'd lost friends that had been really important to me in my first year here.  Either through distance or douchebaggary, they weren't there for me, or the people I'd been friends with.  And it made me really sad.  I think part of my post-break-up-break-down had to do with the fact that I felt like I was losing a lot of people in my Halifax life.  I even wrote a letter to my one friend (not one of the above mentioned) and explained to her why I was sad and that I missed her.  And things got better for a bit, but they quickly returned to what they were, so I washed my hands of her.  But lately, I've gotten 2 friends back.  One is going to take a lot more time to really have back, and tonight I feel like I made a lot of progress in the right direction, but I'm on the right path.  And it makes me really happy."

"event","You know those agreements people make: ""If we're not married by the time we're 40, we'll marry each other"".  Denis told me his (our) friend's ex said that to him (our friend, not Denis) and our friend pretty much told his ex to fuck off.  It got me thinking, why do people make these agreements?  Why do they propose such things?  Marriage is forever, and I would hope not something you settle into.  Perhaps it is my post-break up mind that is wondering this, but I've always hoped for myself that I wouldn't settle.  And in making this agreement, you have decided that you won't be able to find someone in that amount of time that will make you truly happy.  So you decide that spending forever with this other person that you like just enough will be better than trying to find this person about whom you are passionate.  In my friend's situation, he had dated this girl.  Clearly something happened that they are no longer dating.  And if that's the case, their relationship must not work.  So why would they make a date to confine themselves to that unworking relationship for as long as they both shall live?  Just seems strange to me.  And not a life I would want.  I'd rather be on my own and fulfill my life in other ways than have a husband who is alright I guess.  What kind of life is that?"

"event","I went to a part on Friday.  My friend Holly graduated.  So she was the only one that I knew at this party, and because of that, Denis didn't come.  It was good.  We ended up at someone else's place and at the end of the night I was standing on the balcony with just this guy, Kevin.  We were just sitting talking, he asked me a question and said ""Wait, I have to do something."" And he walked over, he took my hands in his face, and he kissed me.  I didn't know what to do.  I just sat there for a second just kind of like, ummm what just happened?!  It was an amazing kiss.  He said, ""Ok, continue"" and I answered the question.  And then we made out.  

And then Denis came and picked me up.

The next day, I didn't feel guilty.  Which made me think that perhaps I shouldn't be in this relationship anymore.  And I thought about it more and I talked about it with a couple of people and really decided that I wasn't happy.  I don't think I've been happy for a while, to be honest.  We were bickering a lot.  I was barely off the plane when I got home from Cuba and I was annoyed with him.  We're just so different.  Kevin is basically the complete opposite of Denis.  He's social, and forward and decisive.  It wasn't Kevin himself, but the idea of Kevin, that someone like that exists, it showed me that what I want is out there.

So on Tuesday, I broke up with Denis.  It was really sad.  We both cried. I'd always told him that he loved me more than I loved him and I think he thought it was a joke, but I was serious. After he left he sent me a message and said that he was sorry he failed as a boyfriend.  I told him he didn't fail.  And he said that he tried as hard as he could but it wasn't good enough.  That broke my heart.  So I cried all night, drank everything I had in the house (2 strongbows, 1 screwdriver), sent some texts - the replies to which made me cry even more, and went to bed.

On Wednesday I still felt like poo so I went to my friend Laura's house.  She basically made me laugh for 2 hours straight, which was exactly what I needed.  And I started to feel better.  Wednesday night he sent me a text saying that he thinks he's done being sad, can we be friends now?  I said yes, but I'm not sure if he's really going to be ok.  I guess there's only one way to find out.

I think that we were kidding ourselves thinking we could make it to August, shake hands and be on our way.  It's too hard to date when you have a set end date.  It was like I was expiration dating.  And I just couldn't do it anymore.  Kevin was just a catalyst for something that was inevitable."

"event","I'm so full of rage right now.

First, a little back story.  Denis has only had one other girlfriend.  And she cheated on him and broke his heart.  Her name is Shea.

Though she broke his heart, he has for some reason remained friends with her.  She is on his facebook.  She messages him and chats to him and they discuss everything in their lives.  

Including me and his and my relationship.

It bothers me to no end.  

Every time they talk, I find out about it somehow.  First I would see notifications of her posting on his wall, then eventually, I would look for history of their chats.  I know it's not right to snoop, but he knows that it bothers me, but still keeps it from me.  Every time I find out it becomes a huge fight.

Tonight I went on his computer after he'd gone to bed and his facebook was open, so I just looked to see if they'd chatted.  If her name isn't in the drop down, then I'm satisfied that they haven't spoken and I log out of his and into mine.  That's the only place I look.  Her name was there tonight.  So I clicked on it, and it took me a sweet lifetime to get to the start of the conversation.  And some of the stuff that was said in the conversation, it really hurt me.  And they talked about his and my relationship and I hate that.  I didn't even get to the end of the conversation before Denis got up and came out.  I only had time to click on a new tab, so he saw what I was reading.  He got so angry that I'd gone through his stuff and I got angry that he did it.  I know that she messages him every time, but he knows how much it bothers me. As far as I'm concerned, all he has to do is say ""You know what, it really bothers Meaghan when we talk, so I think it's best if we don't"" And that would be it.  But he hasn't done that, and we've had this fight no less than 4 times.  It's not that I'm jealous of her or anything, and I know he would never do anything with her.  It's the simple fact that she treated him like shit, but he still speaks to her and talks to her about all manner of things.  

So I left.  Denis isn't good with words, so I was just waiting for him to speak.  It's really hard to have a fight with him, but that's besides the point.  He finally said that he wanted to be alone and I left.  But leaving made me so angry.  It feels like he thinks he's the only injured party. It really doesn't seem like he gets how I feel about it.  As if the fact that she messages him makes all the difference.  Since he doesn't initiate the conversation, that makes it ok.  He may not start it, but he doesn't have to continue it."

I've been texting him, and he's been telling me how he's been loving every single minute of it.  I'm really happy for him, but I'm kind of jealous at the same time. I'm jealous he gets to move there soon and I still have to be here.  So many people I know are graduating this year and the closer April gets, the more frustrated I am that I'm not.  And it isn't as if I effed up and have to stay another year, I'm only in third year, and 4 years is how long it takes.  But I am really thinking about how my degree panned out and it's left me wishing I'd done so much differently.  I know it's all hindsight, and some of the stuff I legit had no way of knowing at the time that there would have been a better path, but some stuff I really should have done better, and maybe that would have led to the other stuff."

"event","One day last term Denis asked me if I actually like math.  He says I complain about it all the time, so it's hard to tell if I actually like it.  I've found myself wondering lately.  It's barely 2 weeks into this term and I really can't wait for it to be over.  I'm just not interested in any of my classes (except 1, game theory you are making my life right now).  I'm in this graph theory class that seems to just be an extension of my 2135 class that I hated but with a few graphs sprinkled in.  The prof is a dick and the text is so hard to read (it basically says mathmathmathmathmathmathmath). I'm thinking about dropping it, but I need 8 3000 level or higher classes.  Right now I have 2, and am taking 2 more this term.  If I drop this one, I'd have to take 5 next year, and that doesn't give me a lot of breathing room.  Also, there are a fair number of classes that I am not interested in and some I can't take because I don't have the pre-reqs. I look at some people in my life like Denis or Tierney and they love love LOVE their degrees.  I only like parts of mine, and just complain about the rest.  Denis keeps asking me what I'm going to take next year and I keep telling him that I have to wait and see what's offered.  Which is partly true.  But I partly don't know how I'm going to find another 4 classes."

"event","I'm getting really sick of people judging my relationship.  

I was speaking to my mom the other day and she referred to it as a friendship, and I was like, Mom, we're dating.  And she was like, yes but you keep saying it isn't going anywhere, and I said yes, but we've been dating for a year.  He is my boyfriend for realsies.  You can call it that.  And she was so awkward about it! Last weekend I had a conversation with my sister as well.  Denis had gone to Montreal and Kim asked what he was doing there.  I said Montreal things, and he was checking out McGill and Concordia because he's applying to grad school there.  And she said something and I said that we aren't likely to do long distance, and she was like, "".....so...you'll move to Montreal?""  I was like, no, we'll break up.  And after I told her why, like how we want completely different things in life, she kept going on about how she and her husband were like that, and here they are nearly 20 years later. And while I was on the receiving end of this passive aggressive lecture, I just thought, ""You only married Trevor because you were pregnant, and your marriage barely scraped through at certain times, why on earth would I want that for myself?""

I know Denis loves me, and he'd be happy with me, he tells me that.  But I know I wouldn't be happy with him forever.  And I think he'd resent me for denying him things that he wants in life.  But why can't we just date now and just be?  Why can't we just enjoy this happy time we're having and not have everyone look at our relationship with judgment, scorn and disbelief? It's so frustrating to have to justify it over and over again, when the details and aspects of our relationship is no one's business but ours."

One guy became an engineer and thus boy poison and has slowly inflicted his vile girlfriend on us more and more.  Another guy started going to Dal just for the look of it and basically brags about how poorly he does.  And a third is just so black and white about everything and very unwavering, and it's really hard to speak to him because he has no middle ground.

"event","Last year, I became fast friends with this girl at my work called Catherine.&nbsp; She was super cool, and we had a lot in common, and we just generally enjoyed each other.&nbsp; She'd met this guy online that lived in Edmonton and was all swoony over him.&nbsp; Eventually, they met in Toronto, he came back to Halifax, went back to Alberta, then came back to NS to spend the summer here before she ended up moving to Edmonton to be with him.

When I&nbsp;met him, he seemed really self absorbed.&nbsp; When he came out to stay the second time, he was always on her msn, and he wouldn't let me talk to her, she never replied to my fb messages or text messages, and then she had a going away party when my parents were here, so I&nbsp;never saw her before she moved. &nbsp;

When she moved to Edmonton, she basically built her life around Matt.&nbsp; I&nbsp;didn't like the person she'd become, so I&nbsp;didn't really make much of an effort to talk to her.&nbsp; Today, she posted these pictures on facebook from her night out last night.&nbsp; She looked amazing.&nbsp; She'd lost weight, she'd done her hair all pretty, and she looked happy.&nbsp; So I&nbsp;sent her a text saying she looked smokin, and I asked how she was and how Matt was.&nbsp; She messaged me back that she was good, and that she hoped he was shitty because they broke up a few weeks ago.&nbsp; So, I told her how I&nbsp;didn't like him, I&nbsp;didn't like who he made her become, and I was really sad about the way she just kind of stopped talking to me when he came onto the scene. She told me that when she moved out to Edmonton, her entire life was centered around him.&nbsp; She had no friends of her own, and she even had less self esteem.&nbsp; So when she broke up with him, she hit a really low point, because she literally had nothing. She said she had started to see a therapist and that she was making a solid effort to meet new people.&nbsp; So I'm proud of her for that.

I'm glad that we're speaking again.&nbsp; Not that we were ever really not speaking, but I&nbsp;just didn't have anything to say to the person she was.&nbsp; I think she's on her way back to being the person she was.&nbsp; I'm also glad that she's seeing a therapist.&nbsp; Her following Matt west is the second time she's made a huge life decision for a boy that turned out to bite her in the ass.&nbsp; I think she just gets so wrapped up in romantic ideas and doesn't actually think about practicalities or evaluate the strength of her relationships.&nbsp; I really hope she gets some strength from this.&nbsp; And I'm really glad to hopefully get her back in some form."

The final grades were just posted.

I got a B- in the class.&nbsp; Based on the grading, I could have actually failed the final.&nbsp; I knew I did terribly on it.&nbsp; I'd started the term out so good, but the stuff at the end, I&nbsp;just didn't get, and I don't know if it put me off, but this entire exam period I've been so unable to concentrate.&nbsp; It took me nearly the entire 3 hours to write the exam, and there was stuff that I&nbsp;should have known that I&nbsp;just crapped out on.&nbsp; I really don't know what happened. &nbsp;

1. Montreal
I had applied the day the applications went up to spend 5 weeks in Montreal doing French and getting credit for it.&nbsp; I've waited and waited for applications to close, and since there were no listed qualifications (other than Canadian citizen, in post secondary education, over 18), I&nbsp;really had no idea what my chances were.&nbsp; Turns out, not good.&nbsp; I checked the site today and my status changed from eligible to wait list.&nbsp; I'm not really sure what that means, I&nbsp;just know that I'm not in the first round, and so even if I&nbsp;do eventually make it, I&nbsp;probably won't get the bursary, in which case I&nbsp;won't be able to go, because I&nbsp;won't have the money.

2. Vancouver
Tara is moving to Vancouver.&nbsp; The date she is going is getting more and more vague however.&nbsp; Which is fair enough because she's just doing temp work, and if she gets a job that goes into mid May, it makes sense for her to stay in Tbay and do the work.&nbsp; I had planned to go at the start of June, but had actively not booked a flight because she didn't have firm plans, and well, it didn't make sense to buy a ticket to see a friend when she's not even in that city.&nbsp; So while I&nbsp;hope to still go, I'm not sure if or when I'll be able to.&nbsp; Since I'm not going to be going to Vancouver anymore, I'm going to apply for temp jobs, in which case I wouldn't be able to go in July or anything like that.&nbsp; I&nbsp;would be able to go at the start of September, unless Shaun gets married, and then I'd have to go home for his wedding.&nbsp; And they aren't very good at making firm plans, so god only knows what's going to happen there.

Because I'm not going to Montreal, I won't have the pre-req for the French class that I wanted to take next year, and I&nbsp;also won't have the credit that would allow me to just take 4 classes each term until the end of school.&nbsp; So I've just registered for a French class next year.&nbsp; It's so disappointing for so many different reasons.&nbsp; I was really excited to spend that time in Montreal, and it was so much closer to home so I could have gone, and/or people could have come up."

Maybe it's just the stress of exams and the end of term building up, but I'm getting frustrated really easily with him.&nbsp; I'm not sure I'm ready to bring him home. &nbsp;I really want to go though, so I&nbsp;basically have to decide by the end of the day tomorrow, because that's when the seat sales end.&nbsp; Sigh."

"event","Sometimes I doubt the truthfulness of some of the things Tierney tells me.&nbsp; She and her friend Trent rent this condo from this guy called David Tam.&nbsp; A few months ago, she told me that David Tam called her and told her that he was going to be kicking Trent out because he hadn't paid his rent for a few months and was just sick of it.&nbsp; But he was going to let her stay.&nbsp; So I initially thought that was pretty terrible, but then nothing happened.&nbsp; She said he was going to get served with papers, and would have to leave within 15 days.&nbsp; But nothing ever happened.&nbsp; She said her mom was going to help her out with the rent until her friend moved in in April sometime.&nbsp; But Trent never got served.&nbsp; So I asked her a few times what was going on, and she told me that Trent had giving David Tam a bunch of money, so he was going to let him stay, but not renew.&nbsp; A few days before the 1st, she told me Trent was going to get his notice on Friday, since he only had to be given 30 days.&nbsp; That didn't happen either.&nbsp; So Tierney just told me that David Tam wanted him to move out.&nbsp; Trent said that he was going to try to smooth it over with David Tam, but Tierney managed to talk him out of it.&nbsp; There just seems to be a lot of inconsistencies in the story.&nbsp; She also told me once that her and her bf were going to adopt an Asian baby because they both have Autism in their family (they do both have autism in their family), so the likelihood of them producing an autistic child was quite high.&nbsp; Then a few months later I&nbsp;mentioned how I&nbsp;don't want kids but Denis does and she started saying that she doesn't want kids either and blah blah blah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

And where she wants to live keeps changing as well.&nbsp; She said that she and Brenden (her bf) were going to live in Ottawa because he wants to get into CSIS.&nbsp; Then she wanted to live in Boston (she told me she made a power point presentation to Brenden to convince him to move there with her).&nbsp; Then she said Toronto, and then back to&nbsp;Ottawa.&nbsp; I&nbsp;get that people change their future plans, but it just seems...inconsistent. &nbsp;

Last week when I was doing math, she texted me and asked if I wanted to go over to watch Degrassi because she was feeling like shit. &nbsp;I called her and she told me that she was coming off anti-depressants and was basically having every withdrawal symptom.&nbsp; Which could very well be true, and I really don't want to question the validity of that, but she's one of the most consistently happy people I've ever known in my life.&nbsp; She said one of the symptoms was lack of sex drive, but she's always telling me stories about her and Brenden doing it.&nbsp; 

It all just makes me cautious about what I&nbsp;believe her say.&nbsp; I&nbsp;do really like her as a person, but more questions are raised then answered with some of her stores, so it makes me wonder."

The course schedule for next year got posted and that class is cyclic, so it isn't offered next year.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have to wait until 4th year for it now.

Denis is taking a math class right now called game theory.&nbsp; I was really excited to take that class as well, and I thought about taking it this term, but I was worried that he'd think I was just taking it so that we could work together, so I&nbsp;opted to wait until next year (it's a third year course). It is also a cyclic course, so I&nbsp;have to wait to take it as well. &nbsp;

I had no idea what I&nbsp;was going to take. &nbsp;The two courses I&nbsp;was most excited about not being offered were a huge blow.&nbsp; I think I&nbsp;have it sorted out now, but i've got 4 math classes in the fall and two in the winter.&nbsp; I think I'm going to stick with 4 each term.&nbsp; I'm not sure if I'll only get half a credit for Montreal this summer or if I'll get a full one.&nbsp; I'm sure it's enough hours to get a full one.&nbsp; That would be extremely helpful if it's a full one.&nbsp; I'll just have to wait and see.&nbsp; Well, I'll have to wait and see if I&nbsp;get into Montreal and also pass Algebra, the two are dependent on each other."

Two minutes later, I told him about my plan. Blerg.

I&nbsp;thought I'd get him an Acadian flag.&nbsp; He often talks about how he'd pimp his car out with Acadian type stuff when he had to change his NB plates or moves out to the 'loo for grad school.&nbsp; I found a flag store (thanks random lady at superstore!) and I had told Denis that I&nbsp;was going to have to travel to the depths of Dartmouth to get it.&nbsp; So today, we were talking, and I&nbsp;said about Dartmouth and he said &quot;Burnside?&quot; (which is really depths) and I&nbsp;said no, just main street, but that was deep enough.&nbsp; He said, &quot;The flag store?&quot; and I said, &quot;No, why would I&nbsp;go there?&nbsp;Well, to buy a flag, obviously.&quot; He said it would be weird.&nbsp; I said, &quot;Oh well I guess I&nbsp;could get you an Acadian flag&quot; &quot;I already have one&quot;&nbsp; Two minutes later I told him I&nbsp;was going to get him an Acaidan flag. 

He genuinely felt bad that he kept ruining my plans.&nbsp; He told me to get him the coffee maker, but I told him that I&nbsp;wasn't going to buy him something that he didn't want, wouldn't use and wouldn't like.&nbsp; Up until 10 minutes ago I&nbsp;had absolutely NO&nbsp;FUCKING&nbsp;IDEA what I&nbsp;was going to do. &nbsp; And I&nbsp;know its still a month away, but its going to get into exams soon, and I really want to get all this stuff done as soon as I&nbsp;can.

So instead of listening in my jazz class, I&nbsp;went on thinkgeek.com and got him some awesome zombie themed things.&nbsp; I am very proud of this idea.&nbsp; He and our friend Mitch had like, a 10 minute conversation about how to survive a zombie attack.&nbsp; Out of all of my movies to watch, he chose Shaun of the Dead.&nbsp; Admittedly I don't have that many movies, but you take my point.&nbsp; I hope he likes it.&nbsp; I'm not sure I&nbsp;can return it if he doesn't..."

Yesterday, I&nbsp;went to the lady parts doctor and it did not go well.&nbsp; My last pap came back abnormal, so I&nbsp;basically, this whole process is starting over again.&nbsp; They did another pap, and they took something to biopsy (which REALLY&nbsp;fucking hurt) and I&nbsp;have to go back in 8-12 weeks.&nbsp; If the one I&nbsp;had yesterday comes back abnormal, then I&nbsp;have to go for other tests.&nbsp; Its really frustrating because I&nbsp;thought this was done.&nbsp; No one even called me about the test results, so I had no idea when I went in that any of that was going to happen.&nbsp; This appointment was basically a just to be on the safe side appointment.&nbsp; So I just felt shit after it.&nbsp; 

I was texting Denis about how it was shit and how I felt shit and just how it was all shit. &nbsp;I was making dinner and I decided to have a drink, because I was really upset about it all.&nbsp; So we were texting and I said that I wouldn't say no to a drinking buddy, so he came up to my apartment.&nbsp; When he got off the bus he gave me a hug, and that was nice, I&nbsp;needed it.&nbsp; We went to the liquor store (where we both got IDed!) and then came back to my house.&nbsp; Where I&nbsp;proceeded to get shit faced. &nbsp;It was really embarrassing how drunk I was.&nbsp; Anyway, I&nbsp;had gone to the bathroom and I was washing my hands and I fell over.&nbsp; Into the tub.&nbsp; Denis heard me, and came to the door and asked if I was ok, and I was (I&nbsp;have a bump on the side of my head) so when I came out of the bathroom, I&nbsp;kind of had my head hanging because I'm an idiot and he hugged me.

And then we kissed.

And it wasn't just like a little kiss, it was a full on snog.&nbsp; The time line after that isn't completely clear (I told you, shit faced), but I&nbsp;ran around my apartment a lot, kept sliding on the floor, which made me fall over more, kissed Denis more, was generally a drunken idiot.&nbsp; He said though that he knew that it was going to happen when he came up.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was like, how's that then? and he said well, we were going to be alone, in your apartment and drinking.&nbsp; He didn't stay, which was a good decision because I&nbsp;was a mess, and I'm embarrassed enough about the way I&nbsp;behaved, I&nbsp;don't need him to have been witness to how sick I got. &nbsp;

We were texting today and I asked him what happens now and he said we could talk about it and I said it probably wasn't a conversation for text messages and he agreed.&nbsp; I asked him if he was glad it happened, and he said yes and asked if I was, and I said ya, I&nbsp;just wish the circumstances surrounding it were different.&nbsp; Luckily he wasn't as drunk as I was and there was some sense somewhere in this apartment, because lord knows I&nbsp;didn't have any. &nbsp;

But the thing is, I don't know what I&nbsp;want. 7 months ago he wouldn't date me, but now we're making out.&nbsp; If anything is going to happen though, I&nbsp;want it to go slowly.&nbsp; With all the business going on with my lady parts, I'm in no rush for things to happen there, and he and I are good friends, so I&nbsp;don't want us rushing into something that either of us might regret. &nbsp;"

This kid is the weirdest kid.&nbsp; I&nbsp;can't understand how Cat swoons at the mere mention of his name. &nbsp;He doesn't look you in the eye when he talks to you, he's kind of shifty and really pretentious.&nbsp; And is 19.&nbsp; But Cat is uprooting her entire life for him.&nbsp; She's found a place in Edmonton and is moving out there instead of going to school.&nbsp; After he came out the first time, they decided he would just stay for the summer when he came out for the summer.&nbsp; And since then, she's disappeared of the planet.&nbsp; She never texts me back, she's never even on her own msn.&nbsp; If it says she's online, its him.&nbsp; I've messaged her at least 5 times and its always been him.&nbsp; Why doesn't he go on his own msn?!&nbsp; Anyway, I leave town in a week and a half and I&nbsp;don't think I'll be able to see her before I&nbsp;go, and she'll be gone by the time I get back.&nbsp; And I really don't mind.&nbsp; It does make me sad, because she used to be cool, but she's apparently the kind of girl that just chases boys and changes to be the girl they want her to be. &nbsp;"

I&nbsp;texted him and told him and said, &quot;You well?&quot;&nbsp; 

He texted back and said &quot;Are you serious?&nbsp;that song needs to be written.&nbsp; I'm doing about the same as the last time you spoke to me.&nbsp; Hope you're better&quot;

 To which I&nbsp;replied, &quot;I&nbsp;feel like you might remember me as some sad little girl.&nbsp; Which I&nbsp;really hope is not the case.&nbsp; I'm doing well. &nbsp;School is going well and I&nbsp;have my own place out here.&nbsp; Home in two weeks!&nbsp; You still working in Markham?&quot; That was on Tuesday and hadn't heard back from him, so I thought it was done.&nbsp; 

Then I&nbsp;got this text last night:&nbsp; &quot;I&nbsp;hoped you were doing better than I am...That's all.&nbsp; I am still in Markham, different position though&quot;

Now,&nbsp;I like Denis.&nbsp; We're friends. &nbsp;The last couple of days, I've enjoyed being with him more then usual.&nbsp; He's been funnier, and less awkward.&nbsp; He waited for me after the exam, and I didn't feel awesome about it, and he made me forget all about it, and just made me laugh. &nbsp;Tonight he came over to fill up his water and hung out for a bit.&nbsp; On the way to the car I&nbsp;laughed so much, and just sitting on my couch with him was pleasant. &nbsp;And as he left he said, &quot;Well, I'd love to stay longer, but I've gotta start driving&quot;&nbsp; 250km is a lot.&nbsp;

I got a 75, thus giving me a B in the class (the final grades aren't posted yet but I&nbsp;just did the math).

I also got a B in 1060 (my first year class).&nbsp; These two classes, along with my stupid chem class (that I&nbsp;took just for kicks!&nbsp; Dammit past Meaghan, why are you such an idiot?!) in which I got a B- bring my average down and make me angry I&nbsp;took them. &nbsp;

I'm not entirely sure I&nbsp;trust that I&nbsp;got a 75 on the exam either.&nbsp; On the second midterm, he added up my page totals wrong and I&nbsp;should have had a higher mark.

She sent me another text on Sunday, but see the above mentioned not wanting to be brought down business.

On Monday, she sent me more texts saying she didn't want to hold grudges like our mom and aunt, and that I&nbsp;still hadn't apologized for being rude.&nbsp; I&nbsp;didn't think that I&nbsp;had been rude, and honestly didn't think that I&nbsp;had anything to apologize for.&nbsp; It got sorted in the end, but she kept texting, and I was just sick of it.&nbsp; But I&nbsp;couldn't not respond, because that would just re-instigate the dramaz.&nbsp; So now she's trying harder to keep in touch, which is great, but I'm having a really hard time caring.&nbsp; I've never cared about her alpacas.&nbsp; EVER.&nbsp; One's sick and she's been sending me all these updates, and I&nbsp;have to pretend to care. &nbsp;

The thing is, she's not the same person that I used to be close to.&nbsp; I&nbsp;used to say that when I got married, I&nbsp;would be happy to just have Kim stand for me. &nbsp;Now that's not the case.&nbsp; I don't know what happened in this last year, but she's not the same person.&nbsp; Part of me wonders if this is all to do with meeting her birth father's family and all her half brothers and sisters on that side.&nbsp; But it feels like since she got her new family, her old family doesn't matter so much anymore."

I couldn't really understand why he would drive me all that way just to see a silly (and by silly I mean totally awesome) lobster.&nbsp; So I kind of let that sit for a bit.&nbsp; But tomorrow is the last day of class, and save for the exam, I won't see Denis for a while, and even if I&nbsp;do see him next year, it'll be very sporadic.&nbsp; So I&nbsp;kind of wanted to do this thing and well, I&nbsp;don't know what it would be, or what would come of it.

I&nbsp;had wanted to ask him on the walk to the bus, but I&nbsp;couldn't work up the nerve, and things were weird.&nbsp; Quiet, but not the comfortable quiet.&nbsp; Tonight, I&nbsp;sent him a text asking him a question about our calc exam, and after a few texts he told me he was in a physics review session and welcomed my texts.&nbsp; Two hours later, I&nbsp;said, &quot;Were you serious about going to Shediac?&quot; and he said sure, why not?&nbsp; And I said, let's go then.&nbsp; Break up your crazy (but highly effective) studying habits a bit.&nbsp; So we're going.

A little while a go I&nbsp;emailed him for some life advice, and he said he was the wrong person to ask, but pointed me in the direction of some excellent people to ask. &nbsp;So I did, and have next year sorted at least.&nbsp; Today he gave us the outline for the exam, but there was no true/false section (traditionally a Barger staple) so I&nbsp;emailed him to see if this was indeed correct.&nbsp; He emailed me back and said it was.&nbsp; I&nbsp;emailed him back and told him that it had been a pleasure being in his class this year.&nbsp; He thanked me and then asked me if I'd sorted myself out.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was so pleased that he'd remembered and cared enough to follow up.&nbsp; I&nbsp;just told him that I'd met with Dr. Brown and he'd given me some great advice and told me some classes to take, which I am doing, and that taking a bunch of classes next year is the only way I'll know.&nbsp;

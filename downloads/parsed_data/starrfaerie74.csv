"event","I am sitting here researching Gastric Bypass surgery..... My sister has been bringing it up alot and was talking about me getting the lap band surgery instead of the other but either way they both have negative side effects that could happen. I am not saying that I would not love to lose all the extra weight I am carring around on me... Because I would love to lose all of it and doing  it quickly so that I would feel better and be able do things that I can now.  But I dont know if I am willing to take that risk.  I want so much to look and feel normal again.  And I know it would make a huge change in my life and me being so scared of my hubby finding someone better.. It's funny I am a great person, I have a good personality, I am smart, I have a great sense of humor, not ugly by any means except for being over weight and he loves me for me, yet I still have that in the back of my head that he will find someone better looking, or just better sometimes.  I would never tell him this of course but I just feel this way sometimes and now with my sister bringing up this surgery all of the time I am feeling it even more.  You know I dont like looking the way I do and I am currently eating right and getting exercise but I still have not lost much weight and I just feel like I will never get it off and feel good about my self agian.. I am not wanting to be skinny... i would love to be around 150 thats it and at that weight I have been told that I would look way to skinny.  Anyway i dont know why I keep going on about it... I am looking into my insurance and how much they pay towards the surgery.. .Who knows I may do it and feel great and be a whole new person.. Well on the outside that is.. I dont want to be a new person on the inside.... I like me just fine the way I am there....


I guess what I need are opionions.......................


Love, luck and lollipops.

"event","We have almost all of our stuff in the new house. I normally can't stand change but this time I think it is going to be great.  I love my new house and the fact that I no longer have to live under my dads roof.  We are finished with all of that even though I am sure he wont ever let me live it down. He will be here on the 1st for good. Moving back into his house. So that should be fun I am so glad he is moving back becuase my kids might get to know him but at the same time I am not sure how much time I want them to spend with him. But anyway I guess we will just have to see what a jerk he is when he gets back.  I will be alot better after Thursday and we have paid our first full months rent.  It is crazy in the last two weeks we have spen over 1,300 dollars to move into this place with deposits and rent and stuff and then we have to turn right around and pay rent on Thursday again and we dont even have all of it.  But we will make it we always do.  We are having a huge garage sale next weekend so hopefully we will make enough money for Christmas!!!!!!! I cant wait until we have our house warming party. I have missed having people over so much and hopefully this will at least be a fun night for everyone.  And I could use the night of relaxing. LOL

On a happy note we had a great Thanksgiving with my family.  Everyone was there even my sisters hubby (which is rare).. And of course she brought my Katiebug!  I held Kaitlyn most of the night stoping only to eat dinner.  She is so cute and sweet. Found out that she has to have surgery in Feb. She has a spot on her neck that they have to go in and remove some kind of tube that didnt close up when she was born and the doctor said if they didnt go in a remove it that it could get infected and make her sooo sick.  I am so worried but the doctor said that it wasnt a major surgery. To me any time they have to put someone to sleep it is a big deal.  But I am not going to worry becuase she will be just fine. I really wish we lived closer to them so I could see her and Sean more often.  He is over here this weekend spending some time with Brian.... I wish all my siblings lived close enough for me to get to know my neices and nephews.  But sometimes life doesnt work out that way.  But I am trying to keep in touch with all of them. :) Hopefully we can keep that going huh sis! LOL...

Okay guys I have rambled on and on long enough. I need to get back to getting my house in order.  Now that we have moved my hubby said I can start decorating how ever I want. As soon as we get the money. I didnt do alot to the other house because I knew we were looking to move and I didnt want to buy a bunch of stuff that might not have fit into a smaller house. I told my hubby that I wanted picture frames and candles and stuff like that for Christmas. Anyway girlies...I miss you guys and hope that your had a great Thanksgiving with your familys and friends!!

Love,
Starr"

"event","Things seem so strange thinking back to this time last year. I had alot of great friends who I dearly loved. But who turned out to be not so great.  Alot of which I no longer see or talk to. And this year I  have some new friend but not many that I do much with. I am so happy with my life just miss hanging out.  Having people to talk to. And of course I write on this thing once in a blue moon and no one even reads it but me.. LOL... I would seem like a waste of time except for it gives me a place to vent.  I dont know maybe I am just down.  Alot has been going on around here.  Alot of changes and I dont do well with change.  I am comfortable with my life and like the way things were going and bam it has to change. (maybe it is just coming at the wrong time of the year ,with Nov. 6th being 12 years since my mother was killed in a car accident, I always get down this time of year ) But we are moving into a rent house on the 15th, Brian will be 13 in two weeks, we have so much going on with work, cheerleading, Brian's choir, Peyton is sick at the moment and of course the money issues that come with all of those things.. And to top it off my ex told me sunday that him and his girlfriend that breaks up with him every other week are going to have a baby and are getting married. UGH!!! It wouldnt be so bad if she wasnt just turned 20 and already had a 1 year old that isnt his, and on top of that he has our two kidos, and another from his last girlfriend. And now the new one is pg... FUN TIMES!!! LOL...Anyway sorry just had to get that all out...

On the happy side of things, we are getting ready for Brian's birthday/ halloween party Sat night at 7:00pm... Which should be alot of fun we have games and food stuff like that and the house looks awesome.  We found a great house to move into at a pretty good price for out here. It is a three bedroom, two bath house with an extra room that was added on, a fireplace, two car garage, nice back yard with a privacy fence and a storage building we are turning into a play room for the kids. And it is in a great neighborhood where there are lots of kids and it is only $850 a month which is great for outhere. I have a job which I love so much. I start school in Spring if all goes well with my test and me and my hubby are getting along great (for as much stress at we are under you would think we would be killing each other)... LOL...I recently got to spend the day with my lil sis bjerk919 which was awesome and I really hope that I get to spend more time with her and keep in touch with her and my nephew (who is too cute might I add) also my dad is moving back by Thanksgiving (which I am not sure if it is a good thing but maybe he will spend time with my kidos). He just makes me annoyed at him becuase I have three kids, not to meantion all the other kids and grandkids he doesnt see and all of a sudden my neice should be born in about a week or so and he cant wait to get back down here so he can see her born and be here for her...Which dont get me wrong I think it is great but he doesnt need to leave out the other grandkids he has. But I am so excited about her being born because I get to be in there when she is born and be one of the first people who gets to hold her...So life is really going good I am just being a whinning little brat tonight. I really love my life I have a great family who loves me, a good job that I love and I do have friends at work and out of work I just miss having friends who come around and hang out.. I am so thankful for all that I do have....


Anyway now that I have bored any of the few that might be reading this and made myself out to be a whining brat I should go. 



Love, Luck and Lollipops,

"event","Figured I would drop in and update.... As of today we find out if we get approved for a house :).. Very nervous and scared. If we dont get approved we will have to find a place to rent and we dont want to rent. But I have to be positive and think we are going to get approved. 

 Aulora had her first practice for cheerleading last night.. It was fun to see all the girls from last year and it keeps us busy like we needed any help with that...LOL>.. Things are getting busy around here with me starting the new job on monday and the kids getting ready to go back to school and stuff. 


 Tim and I sat down the other day and talked about everything we had going on with the move, school, work, cheerleading and I have decided to wait a year to go to school.. Might as well I have waited 12 already what is one more year. Things would be too crazy if I went this semester. I would have work all week, cheerleading on tue and thurs as well as every sat, and then I would have to go to night school mon and wed, and then still try to have time to do online classes and have a life.....So I am bumed about that but i will go next semester or in the fall of next year so it isnt that long and then things will have died down some....

Things with Tim and I are goood.. We went on a date the other night.. I droped off the boys I am keeping during the week and Peyton wanted to stay with them for the night so I called Tim and he met me in town.  We went to eat at a little mexican restraunt on the square and then went to see Charlie and the Chocolate factory... I loved the movie.. Of course it is Johnny Depp and Tim Burton... Cant go wrong with either of them. Anywho.. It was fun to get out of the house with the husband with out the kiddos.... :)


Okay I have rambled on long enough... I need to get to setting up my new journal boutique_aulora..  I am going to try out what my lil sis does.. And see if maybe I can reach some people on here that might want to buy some of my stuff.... Because ebay is sucking ass at the moment.. I am pretty much giving my stuff away... And I cant afford to do that at the moment....



Got to go for now...

"event","Hey I dont know if anyone reads this anymore... But I am going to post anyway.  My life has been a bit stressful these last two weeks.  I had a huge fight with a girl at work (a b***h)and it got ugly but I stayed. She walked out and with her my friend Morgan (my bosses daughter)walked out.  Well needless to say I am learning the hard way that there are no real friends out there anymore.  Anyway so a week and a half passed by and then my boss comes to me the next friday at close and tells me that she has to let me go becuase of it.. Which freaking sucks becuase I really loved my job. I have never been fired before and it couldnt come at a worse time.. Hubby and I are looking to buy a house in the next month or so. And I just got a new car two months ago and that payment is pretty big.. The good thing is that I have a great new job that starts on the 8th of August.  Which my boss knew about and I think had alot to do with her letting me go.  Anyway so I lost a job, and a friend... And a bunch of kidos that I love very much... Anyway life goes on... This all would be alot better if I hadnt stoped taking my pills two weeks ago. They are costing me $50 bucks a month so I stoped taking them.... They would be great to have right now.. Anyway we were suppose to go on vacation this week to corpus to see my friend Christy but it got cancled due to needing money right now.  My new job starts Aug. 8th.. I am the new Teacher's Aid in the Early Childhood/PPCD class at the elementry school my little ones go to... It pays alot better and it will go towards my college credits.  Speaking of I have freshman orintation at Weatherford on Aug 2 & 3.. It is called Fish Camp.. Yeah Fun.. But then I get to registar my classes on the 3rd which rocks.. Then I will be a full time college student, full time teacher's aid, wife, mother and I am still sewing for EBay... Which I love to do... Finally after all this time my life is finally going the way I had planned in the first place...

Took me long enough!!

The kids are great.. Peyton will be 6 in 9 days and going to first grade, Aulora is 7 and just a lovely and awnry as ever and will be in the 3rd grade as well as starting cheerleading on Aug 2nd for her second year, and then I have Brian who is 12 going on 20 I think sometimes he will be starting middle school this year and we are very excited....They are so wonderful and are enjoying the fact that they dont have to go back to that day care ever again... And they are loving the fact that we are looking for a house...

And then we have me and my baby... Well anyone who doesnt belive that there is a soul mate out there for everone well they are wrong.. Becuase they are out there and when you find them you will know.. Things are not perfect all the time but they are wonderful.  We are getting along so well and it is nice to be married to my best friend and someone who stands behind me no matter what happens... It is nice to have someone who belives in me and makes me feel like someone special !!!  I know it sounds cheesy but I guess it is the newly wed thing... We have been together over two years and married for over a year and things are still good... I am truely lucky.. I never thought I would find this...Anyway enough mushy stuff..


I guess that is all for now... We are having a garage sale for the next three days so I need to get some sleep.. 7 comes way to early...

Things are going great around here even though it is so hectic with trying to get ready for the wedding recption on Friday.  I have no idea how many people are coming to the reception. Just glad that we decided to have just us at the wedding.  Getting married at the Park is going to be great as long as this rain stops.  Pretty much everything is done except for me finding a shirt to wear with my jeans.  Not complaining though at least it is not a damn wedding dress.  We both decided from day one that we were not going to dress up.  Going to be jeans so that we are both comfy. LOL.. Anyway I am really excited yet very nervous.  I really hope that Firefly makes it as well as the rest of our friends and family.  Hope firefly isnt to peeved at me about the party on friday.  Ended up just being Christy, and then my ex husband coming out and him and Tim shot pool and drank for a few hours. Well girls I got to run.  Have to go for a conference wtih my oldest sons teacher.  And then come back home and finish getting the house ready for the reception.  My future inlaws are going to be here tomorrow afternoon so I will finally get to meet them.  Hope things are going great with you GeckoWolf and with Firefly.  I miss my Moon baby and my Firefly!!!!  Take care.

Everyones lives are so crazy right now.  Today is mine and Tim's 6 month offical ann. Even though things are for the most part great we have had a few problems.  We had a really hard time yesterday.  Pretty much i have trust issues and he has issues with being open.  He was alone for 6 years so he has not had to share anything with anyone for a long time.  and i have been fucked over so much that i am very cautious about him being so closed with stuff.  But we talked and we really think that what we have is worth it so we are going to work at it.  The kidos are doing great.  So for the most part other than very little drama... Life is good.. Hope everyone is going good.  Hope to see you soon Firefly.. I miss you and my Moon.

"event","Tim and I had a wonderful weekend. Well all except for Sunday night and today. I have been really really sick. The kids had it on saturday and then of course i get it. But feeling better today. A little. Still scared to eat. But that will come in time.  Friday we went to lunch at the Rice Garden.. Then took the two oldest kidos to my ex's house for the weekend.  Then we took the little one and went running around.  We to the Adult Toy shop also.  I sat in the car because we did have my youngest one with me.  But he came out with me a new toy *dances a jig* and some really neat Cinnamon warming oil.  Which we can't use because the goof forgot I was alergic to Cinnamon (tried it on my arm and broke out so thinking it wouldnt be a good idea to use it other places).  But none the less the toy is awsome.  Anyway back on track to the story.  We spent Friday and Saturday together and most of the day sunday but then it was back off to work for him.  Well he brought up moving in again.  He pretty much lives here anyway just not offical.  He doesnt have all his stuff here but he has spent the night here every night for the last three months. But he thinks he is ready to make that step and I think we are also.  So we have decided that he is going to move in.  He talked to his roomates and they are both happy for us and said it would not be any problem at all.  Got to love Courtney and Sarah. Pretty much everyone we have told were happy for us.  But they were the first to really know and they asked him if he was sure that we were ready for it and he told them we were really happy together and they told him that they were happy for us. Told Firefly today.  Had to share that with her. Haven't told my family yet but I am going to. He started bringing his stuff over here today. Feel very strange. But I really think it will be no different then him staying here at night. Other than he wont have to get up and go to his house to check his mail and stuff.  And I won't feel bad because he has all this stuff that he never gets to use.  I mean we had to bring Zues over here just so that he got played with. Zues is Tim's red tail boa.  We brought him over here about two months ago.  So now we are just doing all the trying to figure out where to put his stuff with mine.  God we are going to have two computer desk and two computers in this room along with everything else. Not to mention we now have two more dressers I have no idea where to put them and his huge thing that hold all of his Albums. But we will figure it out. 
Anyway. Just wanted to share. But i have a ton of cleaning to do.
And still moving funiture around so that i can get his stuff into this room and the rest of the house.  Night girls...


Love, Luck and Lollipops...

"event","I haven't posted in a little while so I am just going to go through and do a really quick update. I have a massive headache and dont feel much like doing anything but I figured I would post.  Firefly mostly this is for you since we havent been getting to talk much.  Okay I think I told you that a little over a week ago Jon got into contact with me.  Funny I always figured it would make my heart want him back if we did talk.  But since I found Tim I dont.  I miss him like crazy dont get me wrong. And part of me will always love him.  But Tim has my heart now.  So anyway.  He contacted me the first time and I told you about that well about a week later he IMd me again.  I have both conversations saved if you want to read them let me know I will send them to you.  They are very ummm Wow!  I have some of it I will put in here for you to read but for the most part I will just have to let you read the whole thing.  He is married now and has been unable to share the things with his wife that he use to share with me. Like being romantic and stuff.  And this turns out is my fault.  But since we talked he is better he now has been lifted out from under this guilt he has carried around and feelings he has carried around since me.  *scary huh* LOL.. Sorry...This all came as a huge shock to me. I knew he had feelings for me then but I had no idea that he would have carried them this long. It has been 7 years since the last time I saw him.  Anyway I will put the part of the second IM up for you to read. Then I will get to the other stuff going on in my life.  Like my Tim! yeah!!! Anyway now that I am a big dork.  Here it is!

jon: life is strange..we may not talk for awhile..but do not write us off...I believe in fate..why else would I out of the blue look for you
me: I know.. me to
me: I told you no matter what i always run back into you.
me: I dont ever have to try.. It just happens.
me: Like the Cure concert..
jon: yes...
jon: i saw an article about a man that married his hihschool sweetheart when he was like 90
me: lol...
jon: it could happen!!!!!!
me: yeah it could..
jon: I feel better...
me: I am glad..
jon: glad we have got to talk
me: So do I...
me: I have missed you and think about you often.
jon: me too


And here is more!

jon: i have been there but I am trying to get over you....
me: still.
me: figured you would have a long time ago.
jon: do you remember how much of a romantic I use to be...
me: yes.
jon: well after you I was with two other woman that broke my heart too and I have not been romantic in 5 years...not like I was then
jon: over  5 years
me: That is sad.. you are to wonderful...
me: You know that I was stupid not to date you... But fate had other plans for us...
jon: well that is the reason I had to find you.. it was like someone dying right after you had a fight..I had to reconcile my feelings
me: well i am really glad you did.


more.............

me: we would have been great together...
jon: I do too and if it were not for the children i would leave my wife for you......I love her more than you but i am more passionate about you...that is a reason I had to talk to you...I had to release those feelings for you so I could concetrate on her...
me: It is just not our time...
me: I love Tim so much and I have the passion with him also..
me: He is the only person to ever treat me the way you did.
jon: one day I will write a book and the main charactes are going to be tina and izaak, when you read it it will be the life we should have had
me: promise me to send me a copy..
jon: I will at least let you know about it!
me: no you have to sign me a copy.
jon: ok
me: promise..
jon: promise
me: becuase i will hold you to it..
jon: ok..but how will I explain that tina in the book is not you?
me: you dont have to tell anyone..
me: just sign one and send it to me... 
jon: ok
me: i wish i would just run into you...
me: i know you dont..
me: but i do..
me: to see.. you again.. hug you...
me: I am so happy now...
me: but i still feel the void that our friendship left.
jon: if I saw you I would want you...I cannot do that ...not again...I cannot see you and not have you...when I saw your profile I cried...Yes I am still sentimentile
me: Did you really cry..

Okay getting close to the end of what I am going to put in here!!!

jon: I love you,  but in a way I will never be able to describe,  but now I must concentrate on keri andme,....I may never be able to talk to you again but you will be with me forever...You are the only thing that has kept me from enjoying my wife.
jon: fate will find us,,,,,,,we are soul mates,,,,,,,,,always will be,,,,,,,,do not lie to anyone else and tell them that
me: I have never
jon: not even your husband should you marry
Jon: life is like a painting....there are many points of view..........and many interpretations.....what the other people see is what we want them to see.......what you see is my heart.........love always........jon........until i see you again


Okay that is enough for now.  Those are kinda the High points in the conversation.  Can you see where that could be just a little overwhelming. I mean he pops in my life again after 7 years and then out again just as quick. Well it sucks ass.  But he needs to concentrate on his wife.  And I am all for that becuase I am not willing to give up my life with Tim for him either.  I love Tim and for the first time in my life I am so sure of that.  Very scary I have had feelings for people before but never anything that compare to the way I feel for Tim.  And Jon talks alot about fate but I know that fate is what lead me to Tim. And what kept me from dating Jon all the times I could have. Even though if we would have dated we would have been very happy together. It just was not meant to be. Anyway.  This weekend is at a close and it has sucked. Tim has been sick all freaking weekend. And the kids have been crazy little people all weekend.  I am so ready for them to go back to school tomorrow.  Tues and thurs i have JR. Drill team for my girl and then she has a preformance on friday before the football game. It is kind of a little camp thing were she goes for a few days and then they have a preformance.  Not sure what the point of two days and 30 dollars was but she wanted to do it so here we go.  Anyway other than that the kids are doing great and as soon as Tim gets better I will be so happy.  Firefly I will call you tomorrow and fill you in on the rest of the Jon thing.  And find out how oyu and my baby moon are doing.  I miss you guys like crazy.  My headache has not gone away so I am going to get off here and try to sleep.

Gecko say Hi every once in awhile!!!!!

Love you girls.

"event","Just wanted to pop in and say Hey to Firefly and Gecko!  Not alot going on at the house today. I am going to break down and apply at Walmart tomorrow.  The good thing is BF works there but at night.  He is thinking about transfering to another dept so that he can work the same hours as me.  Yeah!!!  That would be great because we could ride to work together and be home at the same time.  But that is if i get this job. I went on an interview last week and she said she would call by the end of the week and it draws near and no call.  But it is okay because I am not sure how well it would have worked out anyway.  But you guys please keep your fingers crossed on the Walmart thing. Firefly I really hope you get to make it out on Sat.  We might have a pool table again by Sat. Yeah!!!!! BF is going to buy one. Not as big as our other one was but it will be nice to have one again.  We again have a really cool game room though.  He has been working on it all week trying to get it ready for this weekend.  Hung the speakers on the wall in the corners, hung album covers all over the walls, we still have the dart board, our couch and chair is still out there, the snakes are out there or well at least two of them and then we might be getting a pool table.  So glad we are finally getting to that wanting to have people over again stage.  You will have such a great time if you come out this weekend.  If not I do understand why. I have to see if my grandma can keep my kido's if not then they are off to bed and I just wont drink all that much....Oh i was going to tell you that if you need a ride let me know.  I can come and get you.  But you would have to stay the night because I can't do the drinking and driving thing.  If my grandma keeps the kids then I will have to go and pick them up kind of early and I could take you home then. Just let me know. I have to do a bunch of running around tomorrow, my check should be here and I have to go to ft worth to get little ones birth cert. so i can put him in school.. So happy becuase they will work on his speech with him... Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!  Anyway girls I am going to get off of here and take a shower and then club BF on the head and drag him off to bed...LOL  Hope things are going okay with you guys.  


Firefly:  Give the babies kisses and Vandy one also!!!!!;)

"event","Okay does anyone else ever feel like the would like to be anyone else for just a few hours.  I am soooooo bored.  I am tired of sitting in the house all the time.  BF works all weekend and then durring the week I have the kids.  I just want to freaking scream.  I need a night out with no kids.  With firefly or BF either one.  Don't even have to go anywhere big just need to get away.  Would love to go and get drunk off my ass.  Hell maybe on Sat. It will be at the house but at least we will have people out and I can get soooo drunk and not have to worry about driving home.  Maybe Firefly will get that sitter for Moon. *fingers crossed*  Oh Firefly about the problem that I was having.  Symtoms are still here but it was a big NO!  Which I guess was really good becuase it would have prob turned out to be in the tube anyway.  So we talked and BF is very relieved becuase he didnt want anything to happen that could hurt me.  And the other option is still open for us.  Maybe next year we will have the surgery done and then I will be calling you with a big YES! :)  My luck as soon as we move! LOL.  We are still looking into Tenn. or Ohio for the move.  At least in Tenn we can still swim in the summer and have snow in the winter.  Best of both worlds and I will be out of this HOT ASS HELLHOLE!  I have spent my whole life in Texas and I am just ready to get out and see more of the world.  Can't wait to meet his family.  I mean I talk to his brother all the time but I want to really meet the rest of them before I move out of state.  That way I will know what to expect.  He says they will love me.  I really hope so. He has a huge family and mine isnt that big.  We have talked alot about getting married also.  So getting to know them will be a must.  My family like him.  And my kids love him. Anyway. I am just rambling on and on now.  Sorry. Guess I really should get off of here for now anyway.  BF is suppose to call on his lunch break. And for some reason I always miss his call by 5 mins when I am on here. So I am getting off of here for awhile.  Have to put the kids to bed and all that other good Mommy stuff I do everynight.  Goodnight!


Love and Kisses,

"event","First off just want to say my bf is back in town and has been for almost a week now. Yeah!!!!  We have been spending lots of time together but he had to go back to work last night so I am again with free time on my hands.  Anyway now onto other stuff.  Me and firefly had a very interesting/wow  conversation on the phone a little bit ago. And girl anytime you want to get drunk and have a good time just let me know.  I am always up for you coming and hanging out. We do still need to go out for the night.  But we are having a party out here next weekend and you are more than welcome to come out and get drunk and just leave your worries behind you.  BF will be late getting home becuase of work but we can have a great time before he gets here and after.  I know he would enjoy getting to hang out with us together. He will get a big kick out of us together just like Vandy does. :) We are crazy like that.  Just wanted you to know that you took my mind off my little problem for a bit and i thank you for that.  You will be the first person I call when i find out.  Anyway i just wanted to update this thing.  Trying to keep up with it and not go months in between.  BF and I have been catching up on the important things like spending time together in and out of bed.  *mostly in*  Nothing beats being in love and having a healthy sex life.  Normally i just get stuck with some guy that sucks in bed and in the relationship.. So this is a very nice change.  Hope everything is going okay in your life Gecko.  I have been keeping up with your journal.... Or trying to..  Well I am off to get the house picked up and maybe get started on a movie before bf gets off work.. Also have to get into the shower... So goodnight to everyone.. 

Firefly:  Give my Moon kisses and Vandy my love!
Gecko:  Say Hello every once in awhile!

That way I can get some really good time in with the BF! ;)  Ya know!  Anyway got woke up to Firefly calling me becuase she had left her headlights on and her battery was dead..LOL.. But I loved it because it gave me a chance to talk to her.  Which I always enjoy. Anyway.. Firefly we dont have to worry about my ex being at the party on sunday.. His girlfriend fixed that.  She made an apointment for sunday at 1 to have their little boys pictures made.  An hour before the party.. I decided to ask him why he has never had the kids pics made before with their brother.  He said that his girlfriend was paying for it and she just wanted one of their baby.  So stupid.. Anyway.. We wont go into that one.  But my daughter will have a kick ass birthday anyway.  I am going to swing by after I drop them off Firefly... I will call and let you know what time.... Okay girls well i am off to clean and get ready to try to get some sleep.... Love ya Firefly and Gecko hope you are doing okay also....

    Just sitting here relaxing.  The kids are in bed which is such a relief. Nice to have a little break. I have been working on a Pinata for my daughters b day.. She wanted one so I told her we could make one. I know that is cheesy but she wanted one and I dont have the money to buy one. She is happy though we have to paint it tomorrow.  Anyway.. My bf called and told me that he is going to try his hardest to be home on Sunday.. So he will get to be at the party.. That makes me happy.. Becuase after the party he is so getting jumped... Miss him so much.  We are talking about moving to Tennessee again... He really wants to and I want out of this state... I would miss my fam like crazy and Firefly and my baby moon... But we could visit and call and write... And of course talk on here... I dont know.. This is the first time I would have ever lived out of state... I think it would be a great move for us and the kids... But I still dont know....Anyway.. I so have to try to get some sleep tonight... Have a great night girls...


Firefly it was nice to talk today.. Miss you. and Love you lots...

Gotta make some extra money.  Trying to get a car of my own.  My kids go back to school in a little over a week so I am going to try to go to work then.  Keep your fingers crossed that I find some kind of work.  The kids are playing video games and watching DVDs so I get some free time to take pic for ebay and get on here and update my journal.  My roomate came home last night and we got a chance to hang out and watch moives. It was nice.  I have been so starved for human contact since bf went out of town.  Roomate is a pretty good guy.  He has alot going on in his life right now also. He is in love with the one girl he is seeing but she has a bf so he cant see her all that often and then he has this other girl who is in love with him but he doenst look at her that way.  So to fill the void of the one he loves he has been hanging out with the other chic.  I told him to be careful due to she is really in love with him and she will do pretty much anything to get him to date her.  Crazy.. But hey she knows he is just spending time with her because he needs that type of contact so i guess it is her own fault if she gets hurt.  Anyway his life is going a little more exciting then mine.  Thank god for that.. A few months ago mine was freaking crazy as crap.  With me and ex bf breaking up and fighting all the time and me and current bf trying to figure out how we felt and stuff.. Anyway long drawn out story.  So anyone else having one of those really boring sundays?  I have been playing that pc game ALICE ... and another one called UNDYING... They came in a two pack at walmart and they seem to be pretty good.. The graphics on them are well worth the 10 bucks i paid for them.  Anyway girls i will quit boring you guys with my Sunday. Have fun... Gecko I hope we got everything fixed...  And Firefly I love ya and miss ya like crazy girl.. Call me when you get a chance.  Want to come see you and my Moonbaby....

And most of my friends have so much other stuff going on it their lives right now.  Anyway.. I did talk to BF today and it cheered me up for a little while.  He will be home in a week and a half so I guess that should be something to look forward too...He is having a good time and visiting with his family and friends he hasnt seen in a long time.  I am glad he is having a good time.  I need to get out of the house more often.. Firefly we so need a girls night out.  Scary that we have been friends for so long and when you lived out of state we always talked about how much time we would spend together when you moved back and now we live just 30 mins away and still never see each other.  I promise when I get working that I will have the gas money to come and hang out with you more often.. And maybe even get a babysitter for the kidos and run off for a weekend or something.  That would be great to take a road trip...We could take Moon and Pey Pey... They would have a blast.  My big ones could go to dads and then it is off to where ever our hearts desire... Thats it when i start working I am saving up for just a girls weekend.  Anyway... Roomate just got home.. He has been gone for days... But I think maybe he might be staying here tonight....Yeah.. Human contact...Gecko it was nice to talk to you the other night... We dont do that much anymore. Anyway girls I am off to visit with the roomate and maybe get some sleep sometime tonight... Be glad when BF gets home so I can sleep again.....

"event","Okay I have written in this thing several times but only Gekowolf and Firefly could read it.  But I think I am just going to start making it public and maybe get a little feedback when I need it... I am just sitting here on a Wen night missing my bf.  He is on vacation with out me. He is on his way to Tennessee at the moment and will be there for a week and then he will be in ohio for a week. So I am going with out for a little while...LOL...This is the first time since we have been dating that he has been gone for more than a day or so... But it is good. I am spending time with my kidos and it gives me a chance to miss him....My life has calmed down alot since we started dating.  Just to get everyone who may read this up to speed... Current BF use to be a friend of mine and my ex BF... Yeah... Big fun that was.  We started having feelings for each other in Dec of last year and didnt really know what to do about them.  Well as we spent more time together the feelings grew and to make a long story short we did alot of the heavy making out behind my ex bf back. (Not proud of it but sometimes feelings get out of control) Anyway.  I decided that I didnt want to be with my ex and so we broke up. That was total hell for everyone involved. He went nuts.  And that is putting it mild. Anyway. So now current bf and I are doing great and ex bf and I are trying to some what be friends. Which would work alot better if he could stop being a freak. But I understand that he is upset and that is something which  we are both trying to work through and get our friendship of 13 years back.  We were friends for 11 and a half years and dated for the other 1 and a half. Okay now that this is out of the way.  I know I prob sound like a bitch and I wish I could go into detail so everyone that doesnt know me could understand.. Maybe Gecko and Firefly can fill you guys in a litte and make you understand some what better.  I have never been really good with words. I promise I am not a selfish bitch.  Anyway so back to current events.  BF is out of town (hell out of state) and I am very lonely.  And never fails I get online and no one is there to talk to.  Sucks.  But I have been staying busy.  The kids go back to school in two weeks and my daughters b day is 3 days before they start school so i have a b day party to get ready for also.  So i stay busy.. I miss you Firefly.. I need to come up and visit this weekend while the kids are at their dads.  Anyway.. I will stop going on and on for now. I promise I do have days where this thing might be worth reading for someone.  My life isn't a really good story but hey at least it is mine.

"event","Okay this is my first entry so please bare with me.  I am sitting home on a Friday night with nothing to do and no one to talk to.  My boyfriend is at work unitl 1 or whenever they get done so I sit all alone. My kids are in bed sleeping like little angels.  My life is looking up for the first time in a long time. I have a great boyfriend, my kids are happy and healthy, and I have my friends.  Alot better than a year and a half ago when I thought that it would never get better and I would not make it this long.  I was in a very bad relationship with my youngest son's father.  He was a very mean man that use to beat on me. I thank God that he never hit my children.  But they were very unhappy little ones.  But now they love the man that I am dateing now and they are forgetting all of the terrible things they have seen, heard and have had to deal with.  Kids never seem to stop amazing me.  They go through so much and still come out happy and full of life. The only downfall is that my youngest doesnt now will he get to ever know his real father.  I know that he is young and doesnt know now (He has taken my current boyfriend on as Daddy) but one day I will have to tell him that this wonderful man in his life is'nt his father but he is his Daddy.  It takes much more than sperm to be a Daddy.  But he will always wonder why his real dad didnt want to have anything to do with him. He hasnt called or tried to help or see him since the day we left. ( Anyway I was really worried I wouldnt know what to write but turns out this makes a great way to get things out.) Anyway now my son has a man who loves him as well as my other children. He would never hurt any of us and is my Best Friend in the world. He knows everything about me yet he still loves me anyway.  It takes alot to  know someone as well as we do and still look past all of the imperfections and faults and still love them.  I have old friends in my life as well as some really great new ones.  It is not a perfect life and we all have our problems but it is wonderful for me. Anyway I hope this isnt too boring.. But hey they will get more interesting.. Next time I will write a little more about me and not so much about my life.

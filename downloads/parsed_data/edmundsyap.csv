You love to flirt, so much so that it gets you in trouble.
In almost any situation, you find yourself flirting - even when it's inappropriate.
You tend to embrace all flirting styles too.. from coy to sexy to playful to serious.
And if someone flirts back, you'll crank it up even more!</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatkindofflirtareyouquiz/"">What Kind of Flirt Are You?</a></div>"

"event","Things are starting to settle down after last weekends fiasco.  A calm before the storm.  Far from over?  No, I don't think so.  One thing is for certain though after all of this - everyone is even more confused than when we started.  The problem herein lies with the lack of proof.  Maybe its because people are so busy pointing fingers at and trying to kill each other that they forgot to ask the right questions.

As in why did people march to Edsa on the eve of the anniversary of one of our most historical moments?  Why did Gloria decide to declare a state of emergency?  Why did the marines in Fort Bonifacio stage that fiasco of a rebellion?  Why did people go there on the whim of an attention-grabbing colonel?  Why do Filipinos insist on being mindless drones?  Why do we put known rebels in the senate and congress?  Why do we give to the poor only when it suits us?  Why do the poor blame the rich?  Why do the rich blame the poor?  Why do we let the church dictate political decisions and policy?  Why do we go up a feet only to pull ourselves down five more?  Why?  Why?  Why?

If anyone can start answering these and other questions, maybe this country will actually get somewhere."

"event","Coup plots, rallies, state of emergency, martial law.  It's the same old shit.  When will people learn that once was already too much?  And when will the self-righteous idiots realize that the 'masses' are just a bunch of cow being paid to do the work of the political leftists with taxpayer money?  And when will the media actually report real news? (ok, maybe this is hoping too much)

In the last 20 years since we so-called 'proud Filipinos' won our democracy through 'people power', we've actually degenerated into self-pitying, grandstylizing, abusive complaining little media whores.  Yes, the stampede was a horrible accident.  Yes, the leyte tragedy was a disaster.  And yes, Gloria is an idiot (along with everyone else in government).  So what do we do about it?  We commit economic suicide by protesting and holding up the traffic for an entire day, effectively disabling our very short and not-so-prosperous lives.

This, ladies and gents is what we call a conundrum.  I call it shit.  So your life is shitty.  So you don't have work.  So you don't have a house.  So your wife looks like a dogs ass.  Well guess what?  Nobody gives a fuck.  You think people who try to help you give a rats ass what your life is like?  No. All they care about is how good you make them look.  You think your life will improve if you change presidents like you do your underwear? (provided you do have a change of underwear)  No.  Nobody gives a bloody fucking shit.  Deal with it.  If you can't then go kill yourself and stop bothering people who actually try to live."

You fill every waking moment with activity.
You are a shy, idealistic person who does not find it easy to have relationships, especially intimate ones.
You are affectionate, passionate, expressive, and future-oriented.
You are a talkative person, maybe even a busybody!

here's something they never taught in bible class</a><br>
<br>
i especially like this passage from the bible<br>
<br>
""While they were enjoying themselves, the men of the city, a perverse
lot, surrounded the house, and started pounding on the door. They said
to the old man, the master of the house, ""Bring out the man who came
into your house, so that we may have intercourse with him."" And the
man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, ""No,
my brothers, do not act so wickedly. Since this man is my guest, do not
do this vile thing. Here are my virgin daughter and his concubine; let
me bring them out now. Ravish them and do whatever you want to them;
but against this man do not do such a vile thing."" But the men would
not listen to him. So the man seized his concubine, and put her out to
them. They wantonly raped her, and abused her all through the night
until the morning. And as the dawn began to break, they let her go. As
morning appeared, the woman came and fell down at the door of the man's
house where her master was, until it was light.<br>

In the morning her master got up, opened the doors of the hourse, and
when he went out to go on his way, there was his concubine lying at the
door of the house, with her hands on the threshold. ""Get up,"" he said
to her, ""we are going."" But there was no answer. Then he put her on the
donkey, and the man set out for his home. When he had entered his
house, he took a knife, and grasping his concubine he cut her into 12
pieces, limb by limb, and sent her pieces throughout all the territory
of Israel."" --Judges 19:22-29<br>
<br>
would have made a great movie<br>

Looting spiraled so out of control that Mayor Ray Nagin ordered virtually the entire police force to abandon search-and-rescue efforts and focus on the brazen packs of thieves who have turned increasingly hostile.

there's something to be said about catastrophes here in the Philippines.  it's that you rarely see and hear about this stuff here.  if there's one thing to be proud of being a Filipino, it's that when there's a catastrophe, we always try to help (that or we know enough to protect our property from possible looters).  hmm...maybe we need more catastrophes here, then the rallyists would stop causing traffic."

"event","After being drunk for a whole week my nerves are shot and my body is trying to shut down.  I think i'm coming down with something.  Hope it's temporary cause i wanna go diving this weekend.

I suffered an epiphany last week amidst my drunken stupor.  I felt a time of change must come.  So i went out early on Sunday morning, walked into a church (for the first time in many years), and prayed.  Religion still baffles me, but there is one thing that i'm certain of at the moment - there is a God.  

I can't fully explain how this reasoning came about, it's like one of those telegrams that you receive in the  middle of the day that says - God is here. Stop.  Change your life. Stop.  Hmm...maybe i'm still drunk, who knows?

Maybe it's all the karma coming back to haunt me.  Ah well, life moves on and i'm still dumb enough not to notice."

"event","""I'm givin' it all shes got Cap'n, I can'na give ya no more!""  If this sounds familiar to you, then you should realize this is a famous line from the engineer in the classic tv series Star Trek.  Yes, Scotty is dead, he died in his sleep last night at age 85.  I don't know about you guys, but he was my favorite character in Star Trek, only cause he had that cool fake scottish accent.

If you are a Harry Potter fan (or even if you weren't), book 6 'The Half-Blood Prince' is a must-read.  Of course, you'd have to have been following the previous 3 books before it because the story really begins there.  The series is finally coming full-circle and those of you who wondered about the unanswered questions or the tiny details that you thought were unimpressive since 'The Sorcerer's Stone' will come to slowly realize that J.K Rowling had perhaps the entire storyline all thought out till the end.

We all knew that the series was getting more mature as it went along and the characters grew older year-by-year, and the 6th installation doesn't fail expectations.  It is perhaps the most emotional of all the books, building up to the climax that is book 7.  Without giving out too much for those that haven't read it yet, Harrys all grown-up and he realizes after all, that he never should have been a child to begin with.

I can't wait to get my hands on the last book!"

"event","Dating is such a mundane task.  First, you have to set up the date, talk about random stuff, feel out the person as you trudgingly go through the date and then think about the 2nd date (if there is one) in almost the same manner.

One thing that I realized though after having gone through alot of trial and error, is that a 3rd person point of view is always a good way to learn from your mishaps.  Its probably best not to overanalyze your date though, as these things tend to backfire.  As such, the concept of dating could be, simply put, go with what works for you and just forget about the trash."

"event","Mondays.  I detest Mondays.  We should all take a break on Monday so we don't have to put up with the anxiety it provides every week.  Somehow the grand universe has conspired in order to make Monday the crappiest day of the week.  I guess it fits in the principle of alchemy, that once you take something you must give back in equal amounts.  Party on Friday and Saturday night and chillax on Sunday, then comes Monday.  Shitty Monday."

"event","I haven't had much to type about these past couple of weeks, nothing interesting is really happening.  Aside from sitting in the office and watching too many videos on my pc, scratching my ass from time to time and wondering what the hell I'm gonna be cooking for dinner, life is just peachy.

Outside the world is going the same way it has been for the last millenia or so - political turmoil, economic downtrend, mass murder, terrorism (which in the old days were either called the crusades or the final solution to the jewish question), and of course my favorite, metro manila traffic.

It makes me wonder if we, as a species, have come full-circle at long last - from idiots to masters of the world back to idiots.  I know, I know, it's harsh but evolution really must have been high when it decided to put human beings on top of the food chain.

At this point, the only sure way we can save ourselves is to put every new born babe on an isolated island, leave robots to teach them about history and everything else and hope they don't turn out like us.

And the world turns..."

"event","A writer can write, a genius can create.  This is what Stephen King has done in his Dark Tower series - a society with its own terms which, for lack of a better word, seem to sound and mean better than our own.  Take this sentence for example: ""I can be your friend if it does ya."", which sounds more noble than ""I can be your friend if it's ok."", which sounds a bit pathetic.

This is the consequence of reading a novel that sucks you in.  Eventually, you speak like that in real life and people go ""wha...?"".  Anyway, if you haven't read the Dark Tower series yet, I highly recommend it."

"event","I added a new LJ that will link off my website instead of this one, that will be an art blog only.  If you don't want to see alot of personal stuff, memes, etc... and just the art and the process of creating art, you should friend that one instead. <lj user=""v-champion"">

By the way, no one ever comments on this journal anyway, so I am shutting it down. If you want to read my new blog, go to my website, here's a shortcut link. Have fun everyone.

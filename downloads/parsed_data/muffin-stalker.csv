"event","tee hee... i almost died laughing, probably because i am very tired but still... 



Ever since Aaron was poisoned, Mtv has been begging to put his house on
""Cribs"".  But since Aaron lives in a heavily fortified bunker in Caracas,
they decided to pass.  So, they came crawling to me, the sweet Sister who
happens to be second in command.

I love Mtv Cribs because it lets regular people see how sad and desperate
their lives are.  They get to see mansions and wealth they will never
achieve.  I've always felt Mtv should do a show where they go to the slums
of Cite Soleil, Mumbai, and Bangalore. That way people could feel good about
their crappy rundown homes.
But I digress.

When the Mtv crew came to my house I was hoping they would send superstar VJ
John Sencio.  But apparently he's moved on to infomercials selling food
rehydrators, and transvestite workout tapes.  I'm just kidding.  He actually
works in my stable, and no I don't own any horses.

Instead, Mtv sent one of those new darling, interchangeable hosts of
indeterminate age, sex, and national origin.  They were very sweet but
overly hip.  After the third unwarranted use of the term ""crunked"", I ended
up beating him/her to death with a tire iron.  I don't know if they'll show
it in the episode because just as I landed the killing blow, my boob slipped
out of my halter top.  We all had a good laugh.

My house is kind of like the Playboy mansion, but with hotter chicks.  And
unlike Hef, I don't need to be lead by the hand around the grounds in a
stupor.  I also don't spend my days drooling, dressed in a tattered bathrobe
loosely slung over a pair of soiled Depends.  I don't allow girls with
breast implants on my property.  If they wander on, their implants are
forcibly removed and nailed to the wall as a warning to the next bimbo.
When they show this wall on '""Cribs"" it's so covered with implants, it looks
like a sheet of bubble wrap.

The tour of the kitchen is unremarkable since my fridge is almost empty.
That's because I prefer to have all of my food prepared fresh.
Specifically, I want to watch it die before I eat it.  Nothing makes a meal
more memorable than thinking about that moment, the look on the animal's
face as the cold blade touches their neck for the first time.   Never has
a piece of veal tasted so sweet.  I love my eggs really fresh, so my staff
has to try and coax the hens to lay while dangling them over a pot of
boiling water.  Sometimes I end up with hardboiled eggs, and sometimes it
turns out to be chicken soup.  Either way it's hard to beat.

The Mtv crew was surprised I didn't have bottles of Cristal in my fridge,
but suitably impressed that I do use it in my bidet.  We filmed a lot of
footage in my bedroom which apparently can only be legally broadcast in
Thailand.  I guess they were disappointed by my garage and my 1989 Ford
Escort, in spite of the horn which plays, ""When The Levee Breaks"" and
the fact that it sports a killer set of rims.

In the end, they offered me my own reality show but I think I'm going to
pass.  I do want to do an episode of Punk'd that will feature Ashton Kutcher
sucking off Diddy for a gram of coke, while Demi is lead around in just
heels and a dog collar to service his posse.  I know it doesn't sound like
much of a prank, but I already have the footage so it seems like a shame not
to use it?"

I hate cats.

(Well, what did you think the title meant? You should know by now I'm not above an obvious pun.)

Cats are a glaring, ugly, annoying waste of space, and they should be dragged out to the street one by one and beaten to death with a tire iron. There are two types of people: cat people and dog people. Dog people are intelligent, thoughtful beings, and cat people should be launched out of a cannon wearing their asshole as a helmet.


 
The seven reasons I hate cats, in no particular order:

1. They are ugly. Seriously, have you ever seen a cute cat? Kittens are cute, you say? You say wrong. Kittens are just like babies. Babies are not cute. They are pudgy and ugly and smell like the men's room at a gay bar. Kittens are even worse.

2. Cats think they are the shit. Seriously, if you ignore a dog, the dog comes after you and sniffs your crotch until you've got an erection and the phone number of a qualified therapist. A cat ignores YOU. Well, what the fuck? Who feeds you, asshole?

3. Cats are lazy. Can you play fetch with a cat? No, they lie around the house all day like friggin' Mexicans. Contributing nothing to society but pooping indoors. Just like Mexicans.

4. Litter boxes. I hate when people tell me cats are better because a cat is capable of dropping a deuce indoors. But let me get this straight, not only are you more than happy to let your pet drop some brown in the house, you'll allow them to play with it, and save it for later like a leftover calzone? What kind of logic is that? At least a dog knows his place.

5. Cats make shitty actors. I've seen a lot of great dog performances in my day: Old Yeller, Lassie, Benji, Shadow, Hooch, Puffy. Name one great cat performance? You can't. Cats are the Ashton Kutcher of animals: if you see them on a movie poster, you can pretty much attest the movie will suck.

6. Cats play with yarn. Isn't that a little fruity? Have you ever seen dog toys? Giant bones and rubber bouncy things. That's fun shit. I've bought myself a couple of dog toys that I play with constantly. Not like that. Perverts.

7. I'm allergic, so technically, they started it.

Cats. What gay animals."

"event","ugh i have not updated in a long time...
recap of today:
got up at 3:00 pm
showered, dressed
ready at 3:12 (which, in my opinion, is damn impressive)
left at 3:20
was in emerg at the General with my daddy until 7:45 (his tube-thingy in his side draining the infection from his gallbladder had become un-stitched, and was excruciatingly painful, he had to go have it re-stitched so that it would stop moving around)
my parents dropped me off at christie;s at 8 for camille's b-day party
which was okay
until about 20 minutes in
at which time people started bashing on one of my friends...totally not cool, put me in a crappy mood
and i was not in myuch of a party mood to begin with
so i felt rather awkward and uncomfortable....and left at 9:45
i felt like a giant black hole...draining fun and happiness b/c i sort of sat in a corner and felt all antisocial
but honestly
i hate it
like ABSOLUTELY FUCKIN HATE IT
when people talk shit about their friends behind their backs
and dont even have the fucking guts to say it to their faces
...
okay
i suppose i'm done ranting
after all i cant really say much
considering that i know who'll read this
so yeah
take a hint
you fucker."

"event","update: i showered.

haha i have discovered that rabbits do not like hair dryers.  at all.

i have also discovered that the plug is too far away from my mirror, so i can't quite see me while i dry my hair...which resulted in me hitting myself in the face with my hair dryer numerous times....haha who am i kidding, i always hit myself with it. it has nothign to do with the stupid cair dryer cord nto being long enough.

you know when you have one of those days when you're getting ready to leave your house, and you're like, ""crap! today is going to suck,"" and you know, through some instinctive...thing...that it is going to suck because your underwear clashes with your socks?
today is one of those days....*sigh* orange and pink=not good. it makes me sad.

maybe i shouldn't wear halloween socks."

"event","you know what two GREAT words are? ""fine"" and ""nothing""

for example:
how are you? ""fine"".      the person answering is most likely NOT fine, they are probably nowhere NEAR being fine. the great thing is, the word just seems to discourage further conversation, almost as if it is saying, ""i am crappy, but i do not want to talk about it, so go away.""

another example:
what happened?  ""nothing.""      it is obvious that something happened.  the person would not have been asking if it were not extremely obvious that something had happened. the answer, however, says something like, ""lots of stuff happened, none of which i am prepared to talk about, least of all with YOU. screw off and leave me alone, please.""

happy reading.


Finally, all of you, the masses of flesh and obedient slaves, subjective or objective, with no difference, you can feel the effect of tiding up modern arts on the Balkans. Every possibility of creative expression has been prohibited or at least made senseless because of general financial ignorance, useless because it is unprofitable. But when social-political conditions push creative art to the senseless, this is how I raise my own individual rebellion. 

No, we don't have idealistic approach suitable to neosatanist, who justify their behaviour explaining that they are big creator's kids who are destroying old to make new, the one who makes/changes by destroying... We don't want to create anything. We are destroying just to destroy. We are destroying 'cause we've been pushed to senselessness and we are trying to get out of it by destroying. Nothing can be changed. This is the end. And changing the flag won't save you. We don't have ideology and you cannot adjust to us. We are even between ourselves against one another.
We are destroying to destroy. We are destroying 'cause we are enjoying destroying. We tread by treading, we will trample you down by treading: You and your impotent ""art"" with national, regional or religious ""values"". 

Everyone, who would again expose pissoirs calling them fountains, or recite poetry with no existing words- he is called Repeating. He is commercializing and glorifying the senseless in senselessness. So, that's why I spit on your impotent ""art"" with national, regional of religious ""values"". 

















grace campbell had worked at the Burger Bust from over 13 years. Her promotion was coming up soon and she felt she had a shot. ""Thirteen years!"" she said. ""They've gotta know what it takes to smell like recycled grease for thirteen years. I'm going to make assistant manager this time, I know it"". She was confident that her movie career would take off any week now. From then on she would act as if Burger Bust never existed. All her friends she met working there, like Lydia, the widow. Frankie, the 20-something with down syndrome. Marl, the closet cowboy. She would abandon them all. After all, when she was a movie star, she could afford to buy another Frankie. 
The night went on and she decided to make another journal entry. 

""June 17, 1987"", she wrote. ""I'm going in early for my promotion tomorrow. If I don't get it, then there really is no reason to ever hope for a better life."" She felt hot and covered in pins again. ""You don't cry Grace,"" she told herself. ""you save that for the movies"". It was too late. She had crested the mountain of holding in her emotions and came rolling down the other side in a wheelbarrow of depression. She cried for a quarter of an hour and closed her journal for the night. ""maybe TV might make me..."" she thought. She walked into the den and flipped the lights. Her body froze for a tenth of a second, expecting someone else in there. There was no one. She knew there would be no one. ""there never is..."". Sitting down in the birds nest of a chair she bought from Pier One she tried to make herself comfortable, shifting this way, leaning that way. She finally got comfortable and dug the remote out from under her bony ass. The high pitched noise that came from the set let her know that the TV was on. She waited for the tube to warm up. She waited longer. Still longer. No picture. 

""Goddamn TV, you lasted me through the mom and dad's divorce, through high school"", though her failed engagement she thought ""and you want to start F##king up now?"" 

She left the den of her apartment to fix a drink. It crossed her mind that she had thought about having a drink all day while at work. Before that even. Booze was on her mind from the moment she woke up to the last wheezing breath she took while conscious. ""my author can't spell worth a damn,"" she though. ""And his prose is pretentious, inconsistent at best."" 

A shattering of glass hit cut though the air like a Lacey little Peterson. She dropped the Seagrams bottle she was holding, startled with fear

""What just happened?"" she thought. ""Did I just become aware of my own fictious existence?"" She was in trouble now. Suddenly she felt nauseated, like a rag of chloroform on the face had been forced upon her. She saw the TV screen glowing but it was too blurry to make anything out... She dropped to her knees, then her head hit the floor. She lay there, amidst the broken glass for a few seconds... then, nothing... 

Someone else take it now. I'm tired. But then she suddenly rose to the sky and looked up, and what did she see.....I'll tell you....that she saw...."

okay....went to melanie's halloween party, it was fun although we did not stay for the whole thing
then we went to dinner at nickels, where i did not eat anything. i do not like eating in restaurants, i go for the company. i was cold though, due to my halloween costume.

haha speaking of my costume...when i was standing at my busstop this morning, there was a guy there who i had never seen before. when i got outside he started talking to me about how i must be freezing, because it was verrrrry cold and i was in a dress that was not made with alot of material. i am happy, as i have never before been spoken to by a hot random (or at least not one who was not professing a hatred for me). i doubt it would have happened if i had been wearing more clothing, though.

i brought my whip to mel's, it was difficult to abstain from whipping the dog. not that i dont like the dog....i just reeally wanted to see what would happen haha

i am tired, i want to go to bed. i am staying up to watch the daily show, though.  happy news--i do not think i failed the physics test. yay. i'm  hungry, i have discovered that regardless of what i eat i will never be not hungry.

i had my pitchfork at school, i went around forking people. i love forking people, although being forked is equally, possibly more, enjoyable."

then again, she also insulted my philosophizing...she read an (extremely crappy) entry in my philosophy journal that i wrote in french class, and told me that u was very good at making up bullshit. i chose to take that as a compliment, and not a negative comment on my philosophizing.

<P>i also have discovered about myself that, although it takes a very long time for me to become friends with people, when i am friends with them i will have a sort of unshakable loyalty to them and a very strong need/desire to protect my friends from any sort of harm....and another thing i figured out is that i am helpless when my friends cry. i'm not saying i cant listen when people need someone to talk to, just that i don't do too well around tears...so when i am talking to someone, and they are upset about someone else, to the point where they cry...well, i am stuck with the helpless feeling of not knowing what to do to help my friend, and the overwhelming desire to find the bastard who did that and tear out his throat with my bare hands. its really not a good thing, i got a sort of nervous twitch today after seeing, several times, someone who i would love to take a hatchet to.</P>
<P>on a slightly more optimistic note, i feel like crap and am currently wallowing in a state of despair and misery, and it truly feels as though my life has gone to shit. i know i will feel more reasonable later, so do not bother commenting on my horrible mood...</P>
<P>also.....i will not be in school tomorrow (this is in no way connected to my crappy mood, by the way...i would not take a day off school just because i was in a bad mood. well,&nbsp; at least not often.), so i will see/talk to y'all on wednesday.</P>"

WHY do we need a drum set? <BR>not even a <EM>complete</EM> drum set-it's missing one of the cymbals. the lack of a cymbal is <STRONG>more</STRONG> than made up for, however, by the fact that my father also brought home an electric guitar. needless to say, i was rather surprised to open a box that i believed to contain drums, only to pull out a guitar. my dad was a bit shocked as well, when i told him.</P>
<P>i truly think that my father is the only person capable of making such a mistake-forgetting a cymbal but replacing it with a spare guitar.</P>
<P>not that i'm complaining, as he said that we can keep it for quite a while before he needs to return it to work, so i am going to attempt to learn to play it. i'm thinking that lessons are the best way to go about doing it.</P>

<P>oh, and i have also decided that i need a pet. my parents have told me that the only pet i am allowed to get is either a rabbit or a guinea pig, so i have decided on a rabbit. i was rather upset when my father strictly forbade me from getting a llama.</P>

it was actually rather painful at first, as i was mentally cringing at his choice of music. haha for once i was one of those annoying people who blast rap music with the windows down. he shut it off after a minute, for which i thanked him and we began discussing music. i learned that there are practically no punk-ish people at Gloucester, because they are all expelled, transferred, or suspended for fighting with the homie-rap people. we also discussed how he knew mike, and i was a little surprised that he knew where i lived.

<P>okay, imagine something you want, something that would make you happy. reeeeeeally happy. not the sort of permanent happiness or inner peace, but the kind of instant-gratification happiness that you know, you <EM>know,</EM> is just a temporary thing, but the fact that it won't last forever just makes it better instead of making you feel sorry it has to end, almost like you're resigned to the fact that it will end and you're trying to make the most of it while it's there.</P>
<P>k, now see yourself with that thing, that whatever it is that makes you happy, so happy you're practically going into shock because you just can't imagine yourself in such close proximity to.....this.</P>
<P>now, to be fair, you also have to realize that there are nine people watching your every move, and waiting, judging you, seeing if you're smart and strong and resourceful enough to pull it off and do what you're expected to.&nbsp; (so no pressure)</P>
<P>and i have to be honest, i was a little distracted by the, erm, big tall manly muscular scantily clad very wet 'distraction' that i was&nbsp;thrusting up against a wall with my body, so i failed to complete my task, and i had to admit defeat and remove one hand from under this 'distraction', and one hand from this 'distraction's' 18-year-old-that-looks-like-a-25-year-old chest.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>i just remembered why i swim</P>

<P>holy fuck this has been a great day</P>"

"event","went to cottage w/ nancy...tired...arms hurt from kneeskiing
nancy stood up on the kneeboard about 7 times (longest was 5 mins 10), which is amazing and i am in awe of her knee-board-standing abilities, as you should be.

we went to the merrickville fair (yay). it was alright, the rides were actually pretty good, nancy of course got sick after riding this odd contraption where you lie on your stomach and are pinned down with metal bars, then spur in circles and up and down, etc.

oddly enough, the music was, well, almost good. not quite, but almost. they played some songs from bands that don't suck, which made me like them-but i didn't start loving them (as i do now) until they played a song and the lead singer had to have a guy sitting onstage with him, holding up a page with the lyrics on it. after the song he apologized for its crappiness and explained that he had practiced for it by listening to it 3 times in the car on the way there, and had never heard it at all before that.  they also played A Decade Under the Influence, only they butchered it because though the music was alright, they missed about half of the lyrics. 

i only saw 4 frogs the entire weekend, and we only caught one. we kept him in a bucket and if not for my dad, he would still be there now. haha i'd have liked to see what a frog looks like after spending a week in a bucket. probably not too good.
on the bright side, i now have a frog magnet. it is very special.


sadly, my watch battery has now died. there are no more numbers showing, which means that i am wearing an entirely useless watch. meh, we have, uh, deep emotional bonds. haha, bondage. 

there was more stuff i was going to write, but i'm too tired and i forgot most of it."

"event","<P>arg, today was horrible. if i had been doing ACTUAL rescues i would have killed my victims about seven times over-each. im not exaggerating-i was actually terrible. still, despite that, for some very odd reason, i am in a good mood. possibly because i like swimming, and it is not often that i spend a week doing something that i actually enjoy.</P>
<P>also, my good mood may have something to do with the chocolate i consumed on the bus ride home. mmmmmmmmmm, energy food.</P>
<P>or perhaps i am happy because i got home and mike is not here, which is usually enough to put me in a good mood for a whole day, or at least until he gets home.</P>
<P>*sigh* this weekend i will have to force nancy to play dead at my cottage in order to practice spinals on an 'unconscious' victim. or i could just kill her. meh works either way.</P>"

"event","today as i was packing my stuff into my bag and preparing to leave the pool, a child was being dried off by tis mother, and it looked at me and went, ""you have boobies?""  and its mother got all embarrassed as i gave sort of a nervous laugh and looked away, and the mother was explaining to it that that's not the kind of things you say in public, then int turns to me, looks at my chest, and says it again. i smiled at the mother and tried to go faster as i was intent on leaving as soon as possible, and the mother is explaining yet again that we dont say things like that to strangers, when the kid says it a THIRD time. this time i just grabbed my bag and ran, terrified of this sick minded child (who was like 5).

i also had my arm yanked out of its socket by the people who were supposed to be rescuing me. i was to fake a dislocated shoulder and they were to attempt to get me out of the water, and they decided the best way to go about doing this would be to yank me out by the other arm. they were wrong. unfortunately, they dropped me back in, and i was laughing so hard that i almost DID drown."

"event","<P>i just remembered something else about swimming, only this is a horrible thing and puts me in a fairly crappy mood. we did the 24 lengths which must be done in under 18 minutes, and i did it in 14 minutes 36 seconds. that must *sound* good, as i finished well under the time limit. ITS NOT. it is terrible. i felt disgustingly out of shape, because that is a horribly long time and i am failry sure that i was better before. i suppose i could be satisfied (not wuite HAPPY, but satisfied) with 14 minutes or under, but i am annoyed and rather angry that i took so long.</P>
<P>also, the pretty boy i mentioned, i know this is entirely useless but i feel i must add that i passed him somewhere around lap #20/21. it is, of course, entirely possible that he had already gone several laps ahead of me and was simply slowing down to catch his breath or something, but i doubt that as i also finished before him. i finished second. grr</P>"

"event","<P>soo, today i got up EARLY to go to swimming... but its actually very interesting, the teacher is very muscular and has a very pretty body, so i often when he is explaining something to the class, i become distracted by his attractive body, which is very unfortunate.<BR>there is also a very pretty boy in the class, i dont remember his name, possibly mark. he is pretty. veeeeeeery pretty. and you know when people dive into water, they usually crouch down a bit to get more power, or something? well when he dives his bathing suit stretches very nicely over his backside...and they say im too distracted. psssh.<BR>it is even worse, however, when the pretty teacher uses the pretty boy to demonstrate how to properly do something, because then it is entirely hopeless and there is no chance in hell that i would possibly pay attention to the actions, when the view is so good and all.</P>
<P>i also managed to make an ass of myself by bleeding all over, as i gouged a hole in my toe on something, not sure what. i had to sit out so as to have time to deal with the major bleeding.</P>
<P>there is also a teaching assistant, who is very drill-sergeant-ish, but has a very pretty face and a body that rivals that of thte instructor himself.&nbsp; i only remember him because as i was waiting to catch the bus to blair, he rode his bike past me and he said bye. again, not sure why, as i am not one of those people one usually, well, REMEMBERS or anything,. meh.</P>
<P>oh, and also, as i was leaving, i needed to use the ladies room; however, there were only 3 washrooms in the changeroom, one was broken, and there were about 50 screaming children in the changeroom, most of them waiting in line for the bathroom.&nbsp; i decided to use the ones outside, not the ones in the changeroom, but much to my dismay there was another child there. I know it was a child because of the screaming and giggling coming from behind the locked door (that, and there was a camp counsellor or something standing outside yelling ""Amanda, are you okay? Are you having trouble? Do you need HELP?"") and myself being the impaitent person that i am, decided to use the mens room. it was very dirty.<BR>And, of course, by the time i emerged from the less-than-clean bathroom, the ladies room was free. grr.</P>
<P>you know, all of this (except, of course, the bathroom thing), almost makes it WORTH it to get up so damned early...i may even start to look forward to this. eww.</P>
<P>also, if i pass this *fingers crossed*,&nbsp; there is an NLS class august 22nd to 27th, from 9am to 6pm, which is disgusting to swim for that long. still, even though i swam for 3 hours on only 40 minutes of sleep (i did not fall asleep until 6:20, and i woke up [and by woke up i mena mike dragged my lazy ass out of bed] at 7), i am so...happy, oddly enough. i love swimming, it is the only thing i find truly fun at the moment...alot of other moments, too.</P>
<P>also, VERY sadly, my watch has died. i know that absolutely no one cares but me, but i have strong emotional ties with that watch. i love that watch. i never remove it, EVER. not even to shower. i cant remember the last time i took it off-and today i learned the consequences of removing it, although in all fairness it was not me who took it off (i was attempting to pull an unconscious person out of the water, and i was having difficulty grasping her arm properly because of my watch, only if i used my other hand to remove it i would drop her. my purdy teacher fixed it by coming over, taking my arm, and removing my watch. this was a good thing at the time as i successfully did not kill my victim...BUT, it no longer works. this makes me unbelievably sad.</P>"

The cow said, ""Thats kind of a tough life you want me to live for 60 years. Let me have 20 years and I'll give back the the other 40."" And God agreed.
On the second day, God created the dog. God said, ""Sit all day by the door of your house and bark at anyone who comes in or walks past. I will give you a life span of 20 years.""
The dog said, ""Thats to long to be barking. Give me 10 years and I'll give back the other 10."" So God agreed.
On the third day, God created the monkey. God said, ""Entertain people, do monkey tricks, make them laugh. I'll give you a 20 year life span.""
The monkey said, ""How boring. Monkey tricks for 20 years? I dont think so. Dog gave back 10, so that's what I'll do too, OK?""  and God agreed again.
On the fourth day, God created man. God said, 'Eat, sleep, play, have sex, enjoy doing nothing, just enjoy, enjoy. I'll give you a life span of 20 years.""
Man said. ""What? Only 20 years? No way, man. Tell you what I'll take my 20, and the 40 Cow gave back, and the 10 Dog gave back and the 10 Monkey gave back. That makes 80, OK?""
""OK,"" said God. ""You've got a deal.""
So that is why for the first 20 years we eat, sleep, play, have sex, enjoy doing nothing. For the next 40 years we slave in the sun to support our family. For the next 10 years, we do monkey tricks to entertain our grandchildren and for the last 10 years, we sit around the house and bark at everybody.

All too rarely, airline attendants make an effort to make the in-flight safety lecture"" and their other announcements a bit more entertaining. 

Here are some real examples that have been heard or reported: 

On a Continental Flight with a very ""senior"" flight attendant staff, the old pilot said, ""Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached cruising altitude and I'll be turning down the cabin lights. This is for your comfort and to enhance the appearance of your flight attendants."" 

----------------------------------------------------------------

""Thank you for flying Delta Business Express. We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride."" 

----------------------------------------------------------------

After a particularly rough landing during thunderstorms in Memphis, a flight attendant on a Northwest flight announced, ""Please take care when opening the overhead compartments because, after a landing like that, sure as hell, everything has shifted."" 

----------------------------------------------------------------

From a Southwest Airlines employee: ""Welcome aboard Southwest Flight XXX to: YYY. To operate your seat belt, insert the metal tab into the buckle, and pull tight. It works just like every other seat belt; and, if you don't know how to operate one, you probably shouldn't be out in public un-supervised."" 

---------------------------------------------------------------

""In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, masks will descend from the ceiling. Stop screaming, grab the mask, and pull it over your face. If you have a small child traveling with you, secure your mask before assisting with theirs. If you are traveling with more than one small child, pick your favorite."" 

---------------------------------------------------------------

""The weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken clouds, but we'll try to have them fixed before we arrive. Thank you, and remember, nobody loves you, or your money, more than Southwest Airlines."" 

---------------------------------------------------------------

""Your seat cushions can be used for flotation; and in the event of an emergency water landing, please paddle to shore and take them with our compliments."" 

----------------------------------------------------------------

And from the pilot during his welcome message: ""Delta Airlines is pleased to have some of the best flight attendants in the industry. Unfortunately, none of them are on this flight!"" 

----------------------------------------------------------------

On Southwest Airlines just after a very hard landing in Salt Lake City, the flight attendant came on the intercom and said, ""That was quite a bump, and I know what ya'll are thinking. You're thinking that I'm here to tell you it wasn't the airline's fault, it wasn't the pilot's fault, it wasn't the flight attendant's fault ... it was the asphalt!"" 

--------------------------------------------------------------

Another flight attendant's comment on a less than perfect landing: ""We ask you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the terminal."" 

----------------------------------------------------------------

An airline pilot had hammered his ship into the runway really hard. The airline had a policy which required him to stand at the door, smile, and give the passengers a ""Thanks for flying XYZ airline,"" while they exited. In light of his bad landing, he had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye, thinking that someone would have a smart comment. 

Finally everyone had gotten off except for a little old lady walking with a cane. She said, ""Sonny, mind if I ask you a question?"" 

""Why no Ma'am,"" said the pilot. ""What is it?"" 

The little old lady said, ""Did we land or were we shot down?"" 

----------------------------------------------------------------

After a real crusher of a landing in Phoenix, the Flight Attendant came on with, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, please remain in your seats until Captain Crash and the crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt against the gate And once the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are silenced, we ll open the door and you can pick your way through the wreckage to the terminal."" 

----------------------------------------------------------------

Part of a flight attendant's arrival announcement: ""We'd like to thank you folks for flying with us today. And the next time you get the insane urge to go blasting through the skies in a pressurized metal tube, we hope you'll think of US Airways."" 

----------------------------------------------------------------

A plane was taking off from Kennedy Airport. After it reached a comfortable cruising altitude, the captain made an announcement over the intercom: ""Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Welcome to Flight Number 293, nonstop from New York to Los Angeles. The weather ahead is good and, therefore, we should have a smooth and uneventful flight. Now sit back and relax - OH, MY GOD!"" 

Silence followed and after a few minutes, the captain came back on the intercom and said, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, I am so sorry if I scared you earlier, but, while I was talking, the flight attendant brought me a cup of coffee and spilled the hot coffee in my lap. You should see the front of my pants!"" 

A passenger in Coach was heard to reply, ""That's nothing. He should see the back of mine!"""

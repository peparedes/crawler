"event","Well, here we are, another Christmas over and now my attention turns to tonight.

Me and Sally are meeting up with alot of our friends in town for a big night out on the tiles.
Thing is, round here (and I don't know if this is the same anywhere else) Boxing night is traditionally fancy dress night.
Pretty much everyone who ventures out tonight will be in fancy dress (except my bro cos hes a party pooper LOL).

So, what should I go as?????

A pair of Speedos and some goggles - hey presto, Duncan Goodhew LOL

Not really, I've been told that if I went as anyone but Papa Lazarou it just would not be right.

So, off to get drunk in my mischief costume......

How much fun can you have when you're in disguise???

The answer is one hell of alot !!!!

Heres the full list of all of us so far :
Papa Lazarou, policeman, schoolgirl, schoolboy, drag queen, fallen angel, cave girl plus many more to be confirmed !!!!!!!

Should be another great night but I'm not looking forward to it too much in case I over hype it in my mind and then have one of those let-down experiences when you build something up in your mind too much.

Anyways - gotta go, it appears from the smell that dejeuner is nearly ready."

<h2>You Are a Perfect Lay!</h2>
All sorts of girls long to hook up with you, but your standards are set high.<br>
You don't just give it up to anyone, but when you do...they can't get enough of you!<br>
You have a knack for pleasing and receiving, and sex with you is never boring.<br>
Only problem is ~ they all seem to be falling in love with you...

Been having a hell of alot of fun with my mate Sally which is great.
We've started getting along really well again and we're having such a cool time I've got a permanent smile on my face.
Same old stuff done - gigs, clubs, dancing like a loon, going out in wigs etc etc - nothing out of the ordinary !!!!

Anyways, two days of employment left and then I think that there will be alot more frequent updates on here LOL"

I really don't know what I'm gonna do when its time to finally leave but as long as I can have some fun I'm not really concerned.
I'm sure something will come up......

Just sat in my room, pretty bored waiting to start work at twelve.
Hoping someone will appear on msn soon cos the wiganmusic message board is far too quiet at the moment.
Ah well, think I'll pop off for a brew and hope that theres something exciting to do when I get back :)"

"event","So, once again I'm sat in my room with a little too much time on my hands wondering what the purpose of it all is.....
I've been having a difficult time recently (well, I say recently but who am i trying to kid - I always have a difficult time!!)
Trouble is, the reason things are so hard for me at the moment is because I just don't listen to whats being said to me, instead choosing to believe my own version of events.
My life seems to revolve around me getting things totally wrong, and it appears that that is never going to change.
I can be such an arse when i want to be but I was really trying hard not to get like this again but unfortunately my vicious tongue reared its ugly head once more.
Why is it that i find it so easy to be truly horrible to people who i think the world of?
Is it like that for everyone or is it just me ?
Anyways, had a lot too much to drink last night but luckily managed not to be offensive to anyone.
Trouble is, Aftershock was involved which is always a recipe for disaster where I'm concerned. It only takes a couple of shots when I'm drunk to start me crying for some bizarre reason and seeing as how i thought (in my infinite wisdom) that having ten was a great idea you can begin to imagine how much i cried !!!!
Luckily I managed to save it until I got in, well luckily for saving my embarrasment today that is - but not so lucky for my best mate who (once again) had to endure a severe mood swing courtesy of yours truly.....
You'd think I'd learn really, but unfortunately the only thing I've learnt is that i never learn !!!!
Anyways, off i go in search of an adventure for the evening...."

"event","Well, only three and a bit weeks left at work now. I'm really looking forward to when it finishes although I still don't know what I'm going to do......

Last night was the first meeting to discuss the bid for funding that we (the Wigan Music Collective) are going to put in for next years Haigh Festival.
Last year was such a success but the lady from the Leisure Trust who managed the co-ordination of events last year isn't able to do it due to other commitments so theres a vacant role of Project Manager to be filled.
Without someone in this role the festival might only go ahead as a music festival instead of under the ""Arts in the Park"" banner.
Thing is that would suit us just fine seeing as all everyone comes to the festival for is the music and we know how to organise all of the music side of things. They're just worried that they may not be able to organise all of the other events that they had on last year but to be honest I didn't even see anything except the bands last year so it would be no great loss to us....
One of my mates is in the process of seeing if work will let him have more time off so that he can fill the role but in the meantime it seems we're not sure exactly what form the festival will take.
Next meeting in 3 weeks and no doubt nothing will have been sorted by then.

On a totally different note, I'm happy to say that I'm still in love with the same girl although I've made it ever so complicated for us both by causing arguments between us when I really should learn to keep my big mouth shut. I only try to let her know how I feel but it always ends up coming out all wrong and culminates with an argument. Well - not always, sometimes she likes me being nice to her LOL
Anyways - waffle waffle etc etc 

Enough from me for now :D"

Completely out of the blue, one of my mates told me that his mum and dad are opening a bar ib the South of France in March and that theres a job for me there if I want it.

I've always wanted to live in France and seeing as I've just quit my job and don't really have many ties to keep me here this seems like the ideal opportunity.
I'm still thinking about it because obviously I won't be able to see my kids as often as I do now.
Theres someone else who I'd miss a great deal too if I went.....

This could be the change I've been looking for, but then again it could be the thing that makes me realise just how much I do actually have to keep me here.
Ah well, a couple of months to mull it over anyway......"

Got a few bills to pay and then the rest of the week is free to do as I please.
Wednesday is going to be a trip into manchester to watch The V.C's ( http://www.thevcs.com ) and that should be another fantastic gig. The band play kinda alternative surf rock, and they use a theremin to fantastic effect.

Had a good laugh but the club was a bit boring as most people left when the bands had finished.
Maybe we need to find somewhere different to go because I think its too much going to the same place all the time.....

I have a financial review at 12pm today and I've already written my notice out ready. Not because my review will be bad but just because I've really had enough of this line of work and I'm ready for change......
Six weeks notice and then I can take time off for Christmas and then get a new job for the new year.

I'm feeling so much happier at the thought of leaving that i think it has to be done.

Also, I'm not sure why, but i feel alot happier in general. I know really that its down to what one person has done for my confidence even though she doesn't realise it.
I've been thinking about it over the past couple of days because she asked me what she does that makes me think so much of her, and apart from the fact that shes funny, intelligent, gorgeous and the best company in the world, I sussed what it is.
I've realised that if someone so great can care so much about me then maybe I'm not that bad after all.
It's funny how moods change but at the moment I really do feel fantastic and I'm doing everything I can to make sure my mate feels great too - after all, its because of her that I feel good about myself and actually feel that I have the strength to leave this shitty job..."

"event","Well, I'm back. 
Not really been getting online over the last few weeks cos I've not been staying at home. The thing is I fell inlove with this beautiful girl and I've spent all of my spare time with her.
Of course, it being my life, she doesn't feel the same way about me. I got it so wrong. I really thought that she really loved me and the way she acted said that she did but it turns out that she just loves to spend time with me but doesn't love me enough to be with me.
I'm incredibly down about the entire thing and I'm finding it very hard without seeing her but its the only way I can deal with it.
I did promise her that we'd be friends forever and I won't break that promise because promises mean alot to me. At the moment though its breaking my heart to be with her because even though we have so much fun together I just keep thinking how it would be if we were together.
I anticipate alot of writing about it on here to try and sort it all out in my head cos I really find it hard to talk to my friends about it without breaking down.
I'd love to be able to end this with a comment about how something else is going great in my life to compensate for the fact that I got this so wrong but unfortunately everything is shit at the moment.
Ah well, things will start to look up soon I'm sure.
I don't care what she says, for the last twelve weeks she's been my girlfriend despite the fact that she said she wasn't. And the last twelve weeks have been some of the happiest of my life but then I had to go and ruin it with my constant pressuring.
I miss her terribly but I'll get over it. I just hope that she's happy now, but I know she'll be missing me too."

Ahhh the dilemma of choice.
Why is it I find it so difficult to make my mind up about things that I can have a decision on but yet so easy to make choices that could affect me forever yet which aren't really affected by the decision I make on the subject....

You might think your sex appeal peaks and dips depending on your mood - in fact, you're pretty irresistible any day. It's the fact that you're so uncontrived that makes men notice you. Some nights you might glam yourself up, other times you go as you are. Oddly enough, it's the times when you don't make an effort that you're at your most alluring. Men treat you as an equal and know they can have a laugh with you - then, just as they've got you labelled as a mate, they realise they're falling hook, line and sinker. 

Boost your sex appeal by: enhancing your good points. Using your excellent flirting skills - you're playful and teasing rather than off-putting. Just be yourself.

I'll start with the really crappy bit thats stressing me out and driving me to the brink of nervous breakdown :

Work has been an absolute nightmare this week, I don't even remember if I've already posted this but writing on here helps me to sort things out in my head a little so here goes.

Monday - complete schizophrenic lunatic goes beserk at me and being the manager of a store I had to stand there and take it. Fucking lunatic, she's lucky she never got chinned the way she spoke to me (although obviously I would never do that but thats how I felt :( )
By Wednesday, I was firmly back in the bad books with the area manager who only two days previous had told me I was fantastic - he's as schizo as the woman on Monday.
Anyway - I tried to explain that the reason I feel that I can't get my head back into work was that I've been having a hard time since nearly dying the other week.....
His reply ""well I'm not having it, thats no excuse, sort yourself out man and get your head back into it""

FUCKING PRICK.

Anyway today has also been another nightmare as the controller fpr all the tills went down and I've been totally stressed to fucking high heaven.

Its fixed now but I hate my job so badly I'm gonna quit if it gets any worse as I thought my head was going to explode today.
Wonder if I have a case for constructive dismissal against him if I say how stressed I was and he said that and put pressure on me so I felt I had to quit.......

If this is a ""light concussion"" I'd hate to have a proper one.
And how do you get a proper one if a motorbike hitting you at 70mph doesn't give you one ?? I dread to think.....

At least i haven't thrown up today and there were no bad dreams last night.
And I actually managed some food even if it has made me feel a bit funny - at least I've eaten.
Think I'll go out tonight - might even get drunk although that may not be a great idea, but I'll try it and find out anyway !!

Just how good are The Misfits ??
two full days of them now and I'm still punking it up !!!!!
They rawk !"

I keep forgetting everything, I've just locked the back door then walked out of the room and told my brother to lock the back door....

If this doesn't end I think I could be classed as insane - the doctors diagnosis of ""you need some paracetamol"" doesn't seem very accurate to me"

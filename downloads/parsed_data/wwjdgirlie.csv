"event","lol I haven't made an entry since April! That's pretty gosh darn sad! Ok let's see what's been going on in my life:

1. I just got my permit! heck yah!

2. All of my really good school friends are leaving me for public schools.

3. School is officially over and I am officially bored.

4. And the highlight of my life: there are absolutely no guys that I like right now, which is pretty amazing considering the fact that I usually like about 3 or 4 guys at once. 

 I have nothing else to say right now, but being that it's summer I'll probably get bored and come up with something."

It's pretty clean being that cussing in any way shape or form gets your account frozen.  So I suggest that if you haven't made an account with them that you do and then go ahead and look of white_wolf06 and say hi. :)"

"event","Last night was a blast!  We wound up ordering 10 pizzas (2 mushroom, 3 pepperoni, 2 sausage, and 3 cheeses) from american pie pizza.  Then we voted for what movies we were going to watch.  Up stair we watched the sum of all fears, then the rookie.  Downstairs we watched a walk to remember, and the count of monte cristo.  I watched the sum of all fears and the count of monte cristo.  Then this morning, at church, my parents became members of Village 7 Presbyterian church, which is a part of PCA (presbyterian church of america).  So yeah that was fun.  Then in Sunday school (we only have like 8 kids in our class) we got a new teacher.  He is 18, a high school senior, and sooooo HOT!!  *wow* ok I'm done."

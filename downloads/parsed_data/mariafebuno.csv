But it sucks big time, because I don&#39;t get anything done. I watch TV all day, think about ... yes, him. And wonder if the other guy will really look my way.

The truth is I still love him.
The sad part is I&#39;m hoping that the other guy will wait for me.

Him. Navyguy.
Other guy. ArtistaLookalike.

As much as I want to move on, I can&#39;t just forget that I love him. And I can&#39;t redirect this love to the other guy because he deserves something more than this. If we are to be together, we deserve something more.

1. Listen to Maroon 5

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <i>And when the daylight comes I have to go, but tonight I&#39;m gonna hold you so close</i>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>I never knew perfection until I heard you speak</i>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i> Better that we break? :(</i>

2. Watch Pitch Perfect... over and over and over and over

&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Since you&#39;ve been gone I can breath for the first time</i>

3. Listen to some Lenka too

&nbsp; &nbsp;  <i>Don&#39;t let me fall</i>

4. Keep busy

&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Ward na lang ako forever please? Ward-SICU lang ako. Kahit sliding.</i>

5. Prettify yourself

 <i> Buy face powder. Check. Wear BB cream as regular as I can. Check. Need to buy new BB cream. Suggestions?</i>




How not to get over? Get a new love life. Meet someone new. Bad ideas!


I had my first love. I now I have my greatest love. I hope the next one&#39;s my true love. I&#39;m always hopeful like that. But this is too great to let go just like that. Someday, I&#39;ll get over and move on. Someday, I&#39;ll be fine. Someday, I&#39;ll be better. When that time comes, I hope my true love is ready too."

I wasn&#39;t able to talk to you. But I hope all the things that I did for you was worth it. I hope I am helpful enough. I know I&#39;m not your favorite and never will be and I guess I don&#39;t have to try. You are entitled to your own, as I am entitled to mine.

I realized it too late. And thank you, Twinx, for making me realize how wrong I was in your very own subtle way. Seriously, I needed that. I know.

But as I said, kulitin nyo lang ako, di ako magagalit. Kailangan nyo ng tulong ko. Forever. I guess, hindi pala tayo nakapag-usap. Di ko pala kayo nasabihan ng mga bagay na dapat natin gawin. Na-toxic agad ako e :)

Ibig sabihin ba nun totoo ung nararamdaman ko? Na... Mahal nga kita?<br /><br />Hindi kita mahal. Ayan. May katuturan na. Nakikita ko ung kahulugan nya. Hindi kita mahal. Parang kapag pinapa-ulit-ulit ko siyang isipin, alam kong sa puso ko un ung totoo. &#39;Yun ang nararamdaman ko.<br /><br />Subalit nasasaktan ako. Kapag naiisip kita, gusto kitang makasama. Gusto ko nandiyan ka. Gusto ko nandiyan ako sa tabi mo. Sana nasa tabi kita. &#39;Yung ikaw ung una kong sasabihan ng mga bagay na naiiisip ko kahit na ano pang mangyari. &#39;Yung tipong shet di ko mabitawan ang kapit ko. &#39;Yung tipong....sasabihan ko ng.... sana ako na lang. Sana ako.<br /><br />Masama mang tignan dahil mukhang pinagsisiksikan ko ang sarili ko sa isang masikip na lugar. Parang kapag sasakay ng jeep at ako ung huling pasahero. Ung tipong 1/4 na lang pwet ung nakaupo. Mahirap pero pinipilit. Pero mas ok pa ata ung sa jeep kasi alam ko may baba o alam kong baba din naman ako mamaya. Sa&#39;yo? Di ko alam kung may aalis. At di ko din alam kung kaya kong umalis.<br /><br />Paano ako aalis? Paano ako bibitaw? Iniisip ko pa lang na kailangan kong bumitaw, lalong humihigpit ang kapit ko. Lalong hindi ako makabitaw. Mahal nga ba kita?<br /><br />Mababaw lamang ang mga luha sa aking mata. Mababaw lang ang hapdi sa aking puso. Sumasakit lang ang ulo ko kapag iniisip kita. At nanghihina ang mga tuhod ko sa posibilidad pa lang na makita kita. Iniisip ko pa lang na hindi na kita makikita kahit kailan, gusto ko nang matulog habang buhay at hindi na lang gumising. Gusto ko na lang humilata sa kama at matulog...at managinip...baka sakali nandun ka. Alam kong nandun ka. Nandun ung halakhak mo. Nandun ung ngiti mo. Nandun ung HHWW. Nandun ung halik mo. Nandun ung yakap mo. At higit sa lahat....nandun (sana) ang pag-ibig mo.&nbsp;<br />Pero alam kong hindi kita mahal.<br /><br />Iniibig kita.<br /><br />Alam ko na!<br />Iniibig kita.<br /><br />Nandyan na ang pag-agos ng luha. Nandyan na ang malalim na sugat ng puso. Nandiyan na ang hindi mawari ng ulirat. Nandyan na ang panghihina ng buong katawan.</p><p>Ngunit hanggang dyan lang. Hanggang dyan na lamang.</p><br /><lj-embed id=""65""/><br />"

Basta&#39;t mahal kita.<br /><br />This is one of those good days even though I remember things about him...It&#39;s one of those days that memories of him are not painful. On our last night together, I said that he&#39;s lucky because he&#39;s got so many girls...and one of them is a doctor. He laughed. It&#39;s kind of a nervous laugh. But he knows what I mean... I think.<br /><br />&quot;Love is a battlefield&quot;, anyways.<br /><br />The proverb does not only apply to father but also to a certain co-intern and to a certain military guy. And maybe up to a certain point, for a certain seafarer. But alas (whoa!), good things come to an end. And it ends up with me disappointing myself. Always coming short of that one thing I dreamed of, wanted, sometimes need.<br /><br /><b>Lesson #4:</b>Never assume. Yes, even though he teases you all the time, he takes special time with you, calms you down when you&#39;re stressed, replies to your messages, hears your every whine, even complies to your every whim, maybe even adores you and thinks your cute, until he says that he like likes you, he DOES NOT LIKE you. Even if your friends tell you he might and looks like he likes you.&nbsp;Well, maybe unless your pretty or beautiful then you are sure he would say he likes you too. But yes, I am not even close to being cute, let alone pretty and even beautiful, so us mere mortals have to wait for our knight in shining armor or prince charming to rescue us and profess their undying love and even slay the dragon until we&#39;ll have our happily ever after... unless the witch or evil stepmother or stepsisters got to him first. Too bad for us because we might be ending up with ogres who don&#39;t deserve us or not even close to a gentlemen as Shrek is.<br />"

There will be times when you want to stop and go back to where you started. Times when relapse is the only choice. Times when you want to cry and you know he is the only one who can comfort you. Really. But be strong like a rock. You will come to a better place. Better than you expected it to be. Especially if thru this road, you&#39;ll learn more about yourself. And how strong you really are.<br /><br />And yes, it may seem that your heart has hardened. That you feel you won&#39;t love anymore. That you don&#39;t know how to love anymore.<br /><br />It isn&#39;t. You aren&#39;t. You are strong. You are a rock that you can depend on. You can depend on yourself.<br /><br /><b>Lesson #3:</b>There will be good days and bad days. And it&#39;s up to you to choose them. Bad days may come but it&#39;s up to you to change it into a good one. No one, nobody, is trying to make the day bad for you, reminding you of the sad stuff. It&#39;s just coincidence. Sometimes, it&#39;s the Lord&#39;s way of saying this is how far you&#39;ve come, or testing you to let you know how much you&#39;ve gone ahead in this moving on/letting go. There&#39;s a rainbow after the rain. And there&#39;s a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Bad days may come. Rainy days are inevitable. But there are also good days to help you get through. Your life isn&#39;t that-place-where-Bella-Swan-and-Edward-Cullen-lives-where-it&#39;s-dark-more-than-half-of-the-year. It is your life. Yours given by the Lord.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","&nbsp;I love knowing that you're in my heart... and you'll always be wherever you are, whatever happens, whenever distance separates us.
I hate knowing that you never realize these things... and when I take you for granted despite promising that I'll never leave you.

I love dreaming that when I come home everyday, you'll be the one waiting for me... even though we'll be both tired, a smile and a hug will make everything alright.
I hate it when the time comes that reality hits you hard... you're gone and you never really know.

I hate it when I'm guarded... and you give me all the space I want. No, don't give me all the space I want.

Love comes in unexpected places, in unexpected ways.
I wish. I hope.
Come back and stay."

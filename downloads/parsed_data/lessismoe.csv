"event","From this corner of the morning,
I sip on my cup of liquid smoke
     hoping to light myself on fire
And watch the sun burn a hole in the darkness.

While you were staring at the clouds
I was digging the foundation, deep
      and sturdier than you suspected
And now we can stand on this tower.

But what about the vantage points we've abandoned
Or rather, did they abandon us,
      Partner in Turmoil?
Will we ever see those sunrises again?

There is a pattern to this landscape
Though I know you cannot see it
      but believe me, I can see it
And I know that this valley cradling us is Good.

You are destined to Run, Ponderous One.
Why contemplate the mountain for decades
      when it waits to be inhabited
For what use is a mountain view without an observer?

Sunlight touches the crest of the peaks
      and my tower is too small for us both.
Lest you dream yourself into oblivion, Hamlet, 
Kick at the darkness until it bleeds daylight."

"event","My ex-boyfriend in college asked me to accompany him to ""a light opera"". Lovely gesture, eh? 

He arrives to pick me up. As we walk to the car, he says, ""Great, now you'll get to meet Jane!"" Jane is his new girlfriend, and this is the first time I'm hearing about this.

Ok, I can be the third wheel, I don't mind.

As we arrive at the car, I see that there are three people in the car. John and Katie, a couple the ex-boyfriend knew, were also going along.

Ok, fifth wheel. *sigh*

""We're meeting up with my mother at the theater,"" the ex tells me.

*groan* Greeeeat. Now I'm your MOM'S date...

Nothing against his mom. She's a sweet, nice lady, head of all the church groups and 4-H activities.

As we pull onto the highway, he mentions ""Oh, and we're seeing a reinterpretation of 'Cabaret'.""

********

Somewhere between the half-naked hip thrusting by German prostitutes and the men engaged in heavy petting on stage, I remember hearing his mom make a little sqeaking noise. I couldn't tell you what the sweet Christian woman looked like because FOR. THE. LOVE. OF. GOD. I. DID. NOT. WANT. TO. MAKE. EYE. CONTACT!

And you know how people usually like to talk about a performance afterwards? Not a word was said. We had had to park really far away, and we spent 20 minutes walking back to the car in COMPLETE SILENCE."

"event","Keeping my eyes on them as I lowered myself into the passenger seat, I realized that the string between them might as well have been tangible.  

Every time she rocked from one foot to the other, swaying her long hair, his eyelids were pulled to her.  Every time her head cocked back in laughter, his was pulled in closer to her.  Her smile always precipitated a flash of his straight white teeth, and every time she toyed with the strand of pearls around her neck, his hand went up to straighten his collar.

I looked down at the pendant he gave me for an anniversary.  Then I heard their footsteps: his to the car, hers away on the sidewalk.

I always knew.  Some things you can know without admitting them to yourself.  You weave a fantasy to protect yourself from reality, and you tell yourself that you are happy that way.

But there she goes, pulling the string, pulling his eyes to the rear view mirror as we drive past.  I hold my pendant in my fist and look away to the side mirror.  As we turn, I catch one last glance of her, flouncing her hair as she walks, trailing all of those strings behind her."

"event","A tangible shot of electricity radiates from your spine, to your scalp, and all the way down your skin as you break the water.  The mix of air and water at the transition between surface and sea gives way to an ineffable abyss, and you realize that now, the mix of air and water is that of ocean and your breath.  You may look up to watch the glistening bubbles dance upwards, towards the world you belong in.

And then you look down.

Chances are, you won't see the bottom.  Chances are, you'll be surrounded by the vibrant green of an algae bloom, surrounded in a bath of the microscopic, photosynthetic cells that produce most of the world's oxygen and support most of the ocean's food chain.  If you keep looking down, you won't be able to see where you are descending to, but you'll know you're going down because your breath bubbles are still going up and your ears will be aching with the added pressure.

You'll hold your nose and blow to clear your ears, and then continue your descent, reaching up to clear your ears again and again.  If you weren't so conscientious about clearing your ears and were looking below, you might notice that the intial, shocking cold has been replaced with a gentle coolness around the openings of your wetsuit, and your body core is actually quite warm.

Your fins touch down on sand.  You'd better look for your buddy and signal that you're ok.

The visibility is much better down here.  Algae prefers to be closer to the surface, where sunlight is plentiful and the proximity of air makes photosynthesis easier.  Air, oh yeah, you should try to slow down your breathing.  It's hard to control your lungs when your heart is buzzing with excitement, but you'll need to conserve your air if you want to stay down for any length of time.

Slow, deep breaths.  A small, constant stream of exhalant bubbles.

Where will you go?  If you dropped to the sand, you might see enough to want to stay.  Perhaps an anemone is stretching its tentacles out of the sand.  Perhaps a crab is hiding under that shell.

But just beyond your field of sight, maybe that elusive, ancient sea bass is waiting to lock gazes with you.  Maybe you'll surprise a school of smelt, and be treated to the sight of cormerants diving underwater, trailing breath bubbles of their own.

Or maybe you'll just enjoy the silence and the freedom.  Neutrally buoyant, hovering a foot or so above the sand and gliding angel-like over the abodes of millions of creatures you may not even spot, the only sounds you will hear will be the hissing of your regulator as you inhale, the whoosh of bubbles as you exhale, and the distant clicking of shrimp hiding in the sea grass.

What will you think about as you fly through this foreign world?  Will you be fascinated with the intricacies of the alien lifestyles you will encounter?  Will you reach out and touch all of the beautiful things you see, only to have the fragile flesh recoil, and be left holding a shell?  Will you even spare a thought to the volatile world some 60 feet above you?

Will you ever be the same again?"

If you are obviously a native English speaker, and you have:

* Disregarded the 12 boldface, orange-colored signs around the post office indicating that the branch neither carries mailing materials nor has ample space/time for you to fill out the forms required for insured mail at the desk

* ""Messed up"" on two consequtive attempts to fill out said paperwork

and

* Taken at least one full minute to find your wallet in your big-ass backpack

... then you had better be ready for me to glare at you, and be DAMN glad I don't follow you out the door!  Me, and the 12 other people who waited 10 minutes in a stagnant line in a sweltering, un-air-conditioned Post Office Outlet.

"event","We didn't go snorkeling today.  There was a death in our household.

Milo was a gentle soul.  He was very good at hiding, adorable to watch, and an all-and-all great fish.  He loved to eat mealworms out of my hand, and he would make a loud sucking noise at the surface of the water when he was really excited to eat.  In the course of his time with us, he grew from a 3 inch baby to an 8 inch king-of-the tank.  What I will always remember the most about Milo was that, when he was feeding and the other, smaller fish in the tank tried to pick at the food from the corners of his mouth, he would always be very careful not to accidentally bite them.

Milo succumbed to a fish disease this morning.  We will sorely miss him.

We have decided to take the tank down.  It's not the same without my Milo."

"event","So, I covered the desks at work with this paper called ""No Bugs M'lady (TM)"".  It is actually intended to line kitchen shelves and such to kill cockroaches and ants if they try to infest.  I'm using it because I work with fruit flies, and any errant escapees are potential contaminants for the 12,000 pure-breeding strains of mutants I take care of.  Glamorous job, I know.

The fly paper looks just like butcher paper, so I initially liked it because it gave the old, scratched-up surfaces of the desks a clean look.  But, it had an unintended effect.  The plain white paper was a blank canvas, and my assistants started scribbling thoughts down on it as they worked.

""Prodigy 4 life!""

""Favorite Simpsons quotes....""

""What the heck is Bush thinking....""

Now, my desks are filled with wonderful, stream-of-conscience graffiti.  Isn't it wonderful to peek into the minds of others, if only for a second?  

I started writing on the fly paper too.  As my thoughts float this way and that during the dull hours of the workday, I give them an outlet on the paper.  I even started writing a little bit of poetry again, something I haven't really done for months (or arguably, years).  I guess I really needed a journal.

About every 2 or 3 weeks, we replace the crinkled, worn paper. We put fresh, empty sheets of insect paper out, to capture flies and momentary fancies."

"event","There are so many stories in the world that need to be told, but not all of them have a beginning.  Who is to say when the downward spiral of an alcoholic began, or when the first glimmer of potential blessed a child with a bright future.  No, introductory paragraphs and prologues are constructs for minds that love discreet units, discreet packages.

But life is non-discreet.  A woman who eats poorly in her youth can doom her as-yet un-conceived fetus to a life of obesity.  Domestic abuse can have roots in multiple preceding generations...

We have little left to do but to tell the stories we have to tell as best we can, with what limited information we have.  And so, even as we narrate our own stories, we are unwittingly limited narrators; never fully understanding the rich past that parented the present, we cannot possibly know the full context in which we live, nor the implications of our current actions.

In other words, this journal will inevitably leave a lot of important information out-- it may be confusing.  But you see, I'm in the middle of trying to figure it out myself."

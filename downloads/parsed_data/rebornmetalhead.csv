I think I'm scaring someone with my commitment, so I'm backing off for a bit and will just enjoy every moment instead of worrying about the next...

So, I need a car.
My schedule has changed.

Wake up at 6:30, bus, work, lunch, bus, school, bus home, get here at 10-10:30, sleep, repeat.

It's hard. I have a hard time staying awake in school.

I changed so much about what I am. I went from being a big jobless bum, to a hardcore worker/student. Part of the reason why I did that was because I couldn't show I was interested in her before having put my life back in order. I needed to work on myself in order to be... presentable.

I still don't know what to think or feel right now. Some days I get with her and it's amazing, others we barely talk over msn and the interest is just.. gone.

I cannot wait to finish school.. but that's in March 2007. 35 hours of school every week, it's pretty hard combined with work.
I cannot wait to have my career started, to earn money and start preparing to live on my own, have a special someone with me, etc...   I thought I'd have a life with school started, and I guess I do because my weekdays are so busy, but I'm not happy like I was the first week it all started..

Maybe I'm just depressed tonight. I'm listening to this song by Embodyment and it's fucking depressing. Time to turn on some Throwdown."

Friends aren't always friends.
One-sided friendships suck.
We always want what we can't have.

Nothings going on over here. The only person I talk to in Montreal is my buddy Brad.
I'm starting school monday. (18 month welding program)
I need a life, hopefully school will help with that. I'll try to be friendly this year.

That's all you need to know.

"event","Now I know, I really do like her...
At first I was worried about her concerning a few things, but I never gave up, I looked past the things that might have bothered me (which really don't anymore). Today, I saw how she was with kids, and now I know that she's the one I want to be with.

I'm going to wait till I have my license, car, and job before I talk to her about this... I need to show responsibility and that I'm not a lazy jobless musician. Besides, I don't think she needs a relationship right now, but this friendship of ours is one of the best things that has happened to me in a long time. I can't expect anything... so I'm hoping...

On a side note, Charlie and the chocolate factory was a pretty good movie! Except for the Oompa Loompas, I thought they were really gay. But the rest of the movie was great.

I'll have to accomplish something tomorow... because I'm wasting my summer!"

"event","Jeeze, everytime I come back to type an update, I read back on what I wrote and realise how depressed I was.
Well I still have the same struggle but I wont hate myself over it.

I went to a Hamadryad concert (progressive) with Jenna (good friend, don't see her often) and Brad (close friend). I must admit I'm falling for Jenna. A few things about her worried me, but I had a talk with her and all is good. I really hope this is going somewhere... but if not it's ok, she's a great friend and I plan on keeping that friendship. Anyway we had a great time, apart from when she just blacked out and fell back like a stick, that was scary as hell

I'm slowly starting to read the Bible again. What made me start today was when I was jamming in the basement and we lost power, it just freaked me out because I started thinking about stories I had heard, so I ran upstairs, grabbed a knife, and started reading. The power was out for the whole afternoon so I read a lot.

This morning I had an odd note from my dad saying I'm too smart to go into welding and that I should aim for an easier job with same pay. First of all, I'm not that smart. I learn quickly, but I don't retain information. Second of all, that just made me even more insecure and doubtful of my decision. I'm already unstable as it is, I didn't need this extra doubt. But when he came home from work we had a talk and he said he wrote this in a hurry thinking ""shit, what if he hates it? he's going to waste money and 2 years!"" so he meant it in a good way, he meant to say ""you should work in different areas, find out what you like, then go to school"" which makes sense. But I'm already signed up for the welding course and I'm still interested.

The band thing isn't working out either, they wanted to play soft stuff, which I don't necessarily enjoy... I like playing it if it's creative, but this was just getting so boring, so I backed out of it. I'm planning on starting a band with other people, I just need to hear a friend play guitar to see if I'd like to play with him. Apparently he's very good, and plays some Zao at church in between 2 worship songs. And my friend Brad can sing pretty well (now if only he could scream =D), we'd still need a bassist and drummer...

Anywho I think that's it for now. Next update will probably be in a month or two =P  Rock on brothers and sisters."

This struggle has fucked me up enough already, but it still has to haunt me back and I still have to give in every single fucking time.

Why have I left Him?
Why do I willfully sin against Him when I'm completly aware of what I do?

"event","First of all I'd like to apologize to everybody for the following
things : bitterness, anger, frustration, jealousy, doubt, lack of
knowledge and wisdom, and saying things without taking time to think
about it.
Since this summer (must be 6 months now?) I've been searching. It
started out good. Then I took things out of context. I missunderstood
things. I became angry at God. Then it got worse. I started
deconstructing the past, without constructing a new path.
All this was supposed to happen. It is part of the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">transition</span>.
1- Happy with everything, but things start to feel wrong. 2-
Deconstructing the past. Denying everything. Going on about how
insupportable and inhumane it is. 3- Stepping into the new paradigm,
discovering the new. 4- Living in the new era of faith.<br>
<br>
I never thought phase 2 would last so long.<br>
Tonight I watched the third LOTR, then I read a bit in my room, and
then I took a shower. For some reason I just felt like part of me was
dying, and I was crying out to God (I seldom cry when talking to God).
I'm relieved. For the longest time I felt abandonned, and letting this
part of me die was very painful... but it is done...<br>
<br>
Thanks to all my friends for your patience and love.<br>
I love you all.<br>"

"event","Update.

I'm chewing on a pink guitar pick.
I'm holding my new guitar.
I'm on my new computer.

It's great that I have all these things. But none of it compares to beeing close to God, which is what I still lack in.
The same struggle has haunted me for 4 years now. I have tried every trick, method, program... you name it I tried it.
I don't even have the motivation to read the Bible because as I start reading I feel ""damn this is boring"".
I don't get anything out of it anymore. I hate what I have become.

Careers - still not sure. I'm thinking of working 5 hours a day at my current job, in the morning. And then go to school in the afternoon/evening (welding course). It'll keep me busy for a year and a half... then I'll have enough money (I hope) to buy a car before I finish school.... which will make things easier if I get a job as a welder (as welding jobs aren't common in the subburbs)

Musicly, I don't know what's going on either. It's so hard to get something off the ground. We all need to spend time writing stuff together, but that's not possible with my job. Everything is at the last minute. Plus, my cousin's f-ed up shoulder is worrying me.

Blah. Why must I feel shitty all the time?"

As I read back on past logs, I think ""holy shit that's depressing"".

So what's going on with Mr.Joel?
Well... I now work for a catering company, I don't love my job, but it'll do for now.
I just bought a custom made computer, been waiting for it for 3 weeks, I'm getting it thursday evening.
Oh and I already have HL2, UT2004, and Vampire bloodlines : the masquerade.

I still have a hard time deciding for a career, but for now I'm thinking of going to college into fine arts for 2 years, it'll give me time to think (and get better at drawing). Then either NAD center (16500$) for the 3D animation program for gaming... or maybe have a full time band? Who knows.

About chicks, yep they're evil. But I'm starting to fall for one. Although I haven't seen her since the end of august, I've been talking to her on msn a lot. Mostly about my whole faith-shift, camp experiences, life in general, and she has gone through the same things. It is weird because she was once a person I was too shy to even approach, but decided to get balls and to start talking to her. Now we talk a lot, which I need because I don't have many friends around here. Funny thing, she and my best friend went out for a month or two, (puppy love, stupid thing, happens all the time). But yeah.

Who knows where this is heading. I don't.

Life is good. Could be better. But could be much worst (eastern-africa/asian tragedy).

Somebody talk to me! msn, email, anything."

"event","I still don't know what to do.

I had the army idea in mind for the past 2 weeks, and was totally going to do it.
So I decided to spend all the money I had so that I could have a bit of fun before leaving into this hellish life.

As I bought stuff, I had like a vision of just me working, earning money, and buying stuff with it. Earning for a car. Earning for a guitar. Not that I can't earn for that kind of stuff in the army.

As I was watching the Dream Theater DVD I bought, I thought ""that's me."" I can't cross music out of my life.

Music is what I do, it's what makes me who I am. I mean, I don't have anything against the army, except for the fact that I'd have to stop playing/writting music with my cousin, even just playing music by myself.

Besides music, I'd be fine to just pack my things and leave.

Hard decisions... I'm still willing to do it... but it's not easy.. specially telling my cousin I can't start a band with him or even write music.

Still need to think. Gotta make a decision by next week."

"event","I got ""hired"" at this ""place"" which will basicly send me anywhere (I'll be going from factory to factory) to work either on  lines or loading trucks.

I so regret going there, I thought the place I went to was for the actual job, but it's just an agency.

And so now, I'm awaiting the phone call just to tell the guy I wont be able to do anything with them.

While I was signing up, I had a mental image of me signing up for the army at the recruiting office. But I look around - no soldiers, twas all in my head. Then I was starting to wish that I was joining the army. Heck I have nothing to live for. No girlfriend, no projects, no goals, etc. It's just that... I'd learn so much more than just welding school. It'd take only a few months more, and I'd learn everything about wood, textile, plastics, metals and alloys, and of course, all types of welding - beeing paid from day one. Which includes the training - kept in shape and healthy, given GOOD controlled food necessary for the body's needs...

Seems that the advantages outweight the bad sides. So I'll become one of them, what makes me ""me"" (long hair, music, clothes, the way I act) will no longer be. I wont lose who I am, off duty I'll be the same person, but... it's a bit scary that I'd have to conform to a standard model just so that there wont be any discrimination, which is completly understandable...

I'll have to talk to my parents and ask them if I can NOT work for a few months and spend all my time exercising instead. I biked 4km on a stationnary bike an hour ago, and walked 13km this morning. Which is INSANE, but I didn't know which bus to take to come back home, so I walked it.

Anywho, not sure what's going on with me. Opinions are welcomed (but if you're an american then you can't really give me advice since the US army and Canadian army are different)"

"event","Last night I had a big fight with my parents.
Basicly, my brother is beeing an ass. He provokes me beyond belief. I tell him to spend more time on math (because he doesn't spend any) and he refuses to just because he ""doesn't like math"". Level 4 math is the most important math to have because it's what's going to decide what he'll be able to do in future studies. Then he keeps saying ""you're getting angry for no reason"". Now, I am the one who tries the hardest not to get angry and to stay patient. If you don't know me, well, to tell me I'm getting angry is discouraging, and eventually pisses me off and makes me angry. I'd say ""no, I'm not angry, I'm trying to help you here"" and he'd just roll his eyes like a fucktard and always make these faces till I did get angry but tried not to, I just got up, and he'd keep rolling his eyes or making faces, and my dad would say ""Joel look at yourself! You're getting pissed for no reason!""  so they just kept adding up and adding up... I picked up my bowl full of soup and was about to smash it against the table, but then I just put it back on the table and walked into my room, having lost all appetite.

Of course then I was crying because I was close to decking both my brother and my dad, and I hate feeling hatred for family members.

30min later he walked into my room and opened the lights, saw tears running down my face (I was lying in bed), and he's like ""hey man it's ok, don't worry about it"" then ""is everything alright?"" so I just told him ""no. everything is NOT alright, I'm going through stuff, I have lots of things going through my mind, I have to make decisions about what to do with my life, I'm trying to do as much as I can for now""  (of course I didn't tell him about everything, like chick problems or spiritual struggles or whatever). So he asked ""what is it"" so I replied ""I'd rather not talk about this, you guys are not the people I could talk to about this kind of stuff"". So he was kind of angry because I tell people I don't even know on the internet about stuff I'm going through, yet wont even talk to my parents about it.

Heh like my dad can help me with my problem when he has the same problem himself.
Like he can help me with spiritual stuff when he is spiritualy inactive.
Like he can help me with ANYTHING because he does not know what's going on in my mind!!!

Then later that night I thought about the army, which made me cry even more. The army is kind of a last resort, a place for me to run away from home and from my family, to be on my own and not have to deal with them.

Then I heard my dad say to my mom ""I'm not letting him or teaching him to drive my car until he gets a job and pays for the extra insurance""  which I totally understand because my parents don't have much money. But the way they say everything is so discouraging and depressing, they make me feel like a loser.

<br>
First of all, Leanna you were right. But please don't comment in this
entry. Last thing I need is a ""I told you so"" or ""don't worry we still
love you"" or even worst, ""I'll pray for you"". I hate to take pity from
people.<br>
<br>
I've been wandering in things without having a solid foundation in
Christ. I've been filling my mind with lies and conspiracies, and was a
bit too open to other things, nearly accepting every possibility in the
world, as if what I believed in was ""well it makes sense for now but it
could be anything else"".<br>
<br>
All I got from this was a bit of information about why others don't
believe in what I believe. Which helped. But the small ammount of
knowledge I gained was not worth the big ammount of dammage it caused
to my faith.<br>
<br>
I have not been close to God, yet have been studying all things other
than His word, thinking it would bring me closer to Him if I understood
other things. Everything I need is in there. Wether it is all correct
or not, I don't care how many errors or mistakes there are, there's a
message that is given to us.<br>
<br>
I deleted everything that had a bad influence on me. Opeth music,
although I love the band because of their musical abilities, their
lyrics have made me morbid and bitter. All the documents I had about
occult stuff, other religions, Bible errors, all that junk. I don't
need that stuff just now.<br>
<br>
I swear I have not gone one night without slipping with 'it' for the
past 3 weeks. Notice the ""mood"". Neauseated and guilty. I'm actually
feeling sick right now, just thinking of what I'm doing and why I'm
doing it. Hell I know the feeling, I know what I will feel afterwards,
I know it only kills part of me everytime... yet it's as if I don't
remember it while I'm beeing tempted.<br>
<br>
My msn name is ""Infected mind, infested thoughts, this poisonnous gaze
lures me, watches me die"". I guess I'm going to use that in a song some
day. What I must do is clear and simple, yet far and hard to reach.<br>
<br>
I think I'm going to throw up..<br>"

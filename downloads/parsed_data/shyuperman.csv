Now I'm going to bum around NOVA until Deloitte lets me start working in August.  The two weeks of training in the ATL should be fun.  Living at home is going to be different, but I'm glad my parents are cool with everything.  

Kim and I got a really cute bunny.  It's a lionhead mix and it's awesome.  It has a cool mane and sorta acts like a puppy.  Here are a couple pictures of him: http://community.webshots.com/user/beebeth His black fur is hard to show up in pictures so they don't do a lot of justice for him.  We named him Duke and I think it's suiting him really well.

Well thats it for now."

"event","So Spring Break was kick ass.  Miami, Nassau, CocoCay, & Key West were the great places we visited on our cruise.  Nassau was kinda trashy and people kept trying to sell us weed.  But the white sand/clear water beaches in Nassau and CocoCay were amazing.  I had a great time with everyone and ate really well.  I'm definitely going on another cruise in the future.

So I've been back in the burg for 2 days now.  Kinda depressing that we gotta get back to the school routine.  Two more months till graduation, I'm sure that's going to fly by and I'm going to wish that it wasn't time to move on to a different phase in our lives.  I am excited about starting and working for Deloitte, I just hope that I get to start earlier than august.

All right, here are some pics from spring break

It's already thanksgiving... kinda wondering where did this whole semester go.  I have to say this semester has been the hardest semester in my college career.  I'm definitely a different person.  So instead of bitching about the stress I've gone through, I'll sum everything up with how are things now:

Brother of Alpha Kappa Psi
Finished my business plan
Doing well in school
Assholes need to stop hitting my car 
Gotta get my job back at sports authority for break

All of the stress/break downs/work so far has been worth it.  I've battled through them and benefited from everything.  Next semester is going to be different and I don't know how I'm going to handle it.  Just gotta keep on trucking...

So now I have to make my finals my bitch and have the best last two weeks of this semester."

"event","So we had our first official intramural basketball game last night.  And three minutes into the game, I fracture my ankle by landing wrong after getting a rebound.  I was in the hospital for about one hour, I was surprised how fast it went.  Fortunately, I had Jo with me and she was the one that took me to the hospital and situated back at my dorm.  So on my discharge sheet is says ""There is a small chip fracture in your ankle.  This fracture was caused by stretching the joint ligaments, which pulled off a small piece of bone.""  Final diagnosis: Acute flake fracture right talus.  So the doc says it's a 6 week injury.  I got crutches, an ace wrap, and an ankle stirrup splint.  So he said I should be on crutches for about two weeks and hopefully be able to walk around then.  

So I probably won't be able to play anymore games in this intramural season.  I'll be lucky if I could do anything atheletic for the next month.  So that sucks... it's just totally different going around campus on crutches.  And apparently a lot of other people are on crutches too, I think most of them are basketball related too.  So these next few weeks should be interesting..."

"event","Time really flies.  Fall semester is already over and I'm back at home.  It's been a whole semester since my last update.  The past semester was glorious, a lot of great times and memories.  So finals week was fun, I had 3 8ams and an exam on Sunday.  Had exams in all of my classes.  But I am glad to be done and at home.  Being a business major is kinda different from CS.  I enjoy it a lot better and it's more to my liking, but it is difficult as well.  5 business courses next semester so I'll be living at Showker.  So having Matthias as a roommate has been pretty fun.  We started a lot of random competitive games and just lots of fun.  It's official we're living at The Commons next year... 891J.  It's going to be great with Justin, Matthias, and Kyle.  The most diverse apartment you'll see.  Even though we got screwed over by Sunchase we got a pretty decent apartment.  

So this break is going to consist of me working at Sports Authority and relaxing.  I did work at Sports Authority during Thanksgiving break, I worked most of break so then I could keep myself busy.  This break should be interesting, hopefully I'll be able to see people from JMU and have some fun."

"event","hello there... welcome to my LJ...  I guess I haven't felt the urge to update this thing... maybe it's because I've been busy or just lazy.  Well summer is almost coming to an end.  Everything seems to go by really fast.  My life has been taken up by work.  Rec-Pac is great... I really enjoy working there.  I just wish it was longer than 6 weeks.  This week will be the last week.  I'm going to miss my co workers and the kids... they're great.  Working at Rec-Pac has it's advantages and disadvantages, but this year has made me really consider about doing it again next summer.  Hopefully it'll still be the same staff because I doubt it'll be as fun next year without them.  I'm going to miss the parties, bashing the kids, Starbucks, Zebra cakes, PIG, Andy, and everything else.  

On Saturday, the Liu's and Shyu's will be going to Disney World.  It's going to be fun, we're going to be there for 5 days, 4 nights.  It should be a lot of fun without parents.  I guess that'll be the highlight of my summer.  After we get back, I'll probably just enjoy my time before the semester starts again.

Speaking of school, at first I didn't really want to go back.  I got used of working and staying home that I didn't want to go back... I adapt pretty easily... and I guess I'll do the same once I get back to JMU.  However after some events that happened this week I want to go back.  I swap classes so the earliest I have to wake up is 9:30 am on tuesday and Thursday.  My schedule is a lot like last semesters.  I only have one friday class... and my first class on Monday Wednesday and Friday is at 12:20.  So it's going to be fun... except I don't finish until 6:30 on tuesdays and thursdays.  Since I switched majors, I really don't know what to expect with my classes.  Hopefully all of my business classes will be like GBUS.  I was kinda worried because I felt as if I was going through freshman year all over again.  New classes... having to deal with a roommie.. and being uncertain.  Well it also all changed after I found out that Matthias and I got moved to Potomac.  I was really happy after I found out because Potomac has A/C and I'm back at the Skyline area.  It's going to be sweet because a lot of my friends and old hallmates will be at C'peake... and a new Super Walmart openned up near the Skyline area.  Now I'm really excited about going back...

All right I'm out of stuff to talk about... I'll update once I get back to school... enjoy the rest of your summer.."

"event","Heres a post to make my handful of LJ readers happy.  Well recently I have been doing training for REC-PAC.  Tomorrow will be my last day of training, but tomorrow is more like a site set up day.  So far we have been attending workshops for the different situations and activities we're going to do in the camp.  It was kinda boring at times, but overall it was pretty fun.  There are a lot of great camp leaders and directors.  The McNair staff is pretty cool, I have a cool site director and three awesome camp leaders.  REC-PAC actually starts next Monday, which is going to be tight and I guess choatic since it's my first year doing it.  I'm going to have fun getting paid playing games and doing crafts with kids.  I definitely love how the government works because I'm getting paid 25.5hours this week, but we only worked like 20 hours (paid training).  Had training workshops with Justin and Alex Schad (sp?).

Well last week was kinda my off week and prep days for the start of rec-pac.  I worked a week for Shanif.  We painted and power washed a house.  It was fun and kinda difficult.  It a different type of working experience compared to a desk job.  It's sure better than applied technologies.  So thats pretty much the highlight of this month.  Just been up to with the usual stuff... chilling with friends, video games, and stuff.  I'm glad it just  stopped raining.  I guess I don't mind the hot weather... better than rain.  Well this is a pretty short entry.  I hope everyone's summer is going well.  Take care"

"event","I guess I should write an entry.  Well it's been more than a month since I've last posted.  I'm glad to see that I get more comments when I post random stuff on my LJ.  For your information: Russell Wong is cool, I found out that he a main character on a WB show.  It's sorta like a teenage kung fu mystery series.  It's interesting... it teaches some Chinese stuff.... I will be surprised if the show goes the whole summer season.

Well I've been home for over 3 weeks now.  I quickly adopted back to the home life.  I do miss all my friends and things to do back at JMU.  But it's really nice to sleep as long as I want and sit on my ass and do nothing.  Well I got a job at RECPAC, but that doesn't start until late June.  So I've decided to apply for the movie theatre.  The hours there are pretty flexible and I guess I'll try taking on two jobs once recpac starts, but I'll just quit once it becomes too much.  So... I might just end up working two weeks and giving my two weeks notice =P.  Well so far summer break has been uneventful.  I've been hanging out with friends/family, playing sports/video games, and I went to Mike's graduation earlier this month.  I got to visit good old Blacksburg again... JMU's football team will be paying them a visit next season... we're definitely going to get raped.  

Justin and I got memberships at Olympus gym, so hopefully I'll be able to continue with my lifting routine and get off my butt.  Yeah... so basically my summer is going to be made up of working... chilling... and other stuff.  It's going to be sweet in August because Mike, Alice, my sister and I are going to Disney World for 5 days.  It's going to be great with the four of us.  So I really don't have much to say.  I'm surprised I wrote this much.  Well I guess I'll write again in a month.  Have a good summer for those who are already out.  Good luck and enjoy May/Summer Session (Nelly/Jess)"

"event","Happy belated Easter, I hope everyone had a good one.  Well I finally decided to get off my lazy ass and update this thing.  Of course, a lot of things have happened since I've last updated, I guess I'll just talk about things that I can remember.  So I went home this weekend, it was nice because my professor cancelled class on friday, so I was able to go home with Mike on Thursday.  The weekend wasn't too bad.  I spent a lot of time with my friends and after hanging out with alice and linda, I know their latest gossip.  It was nice to hang out with my family.  I talked to my parents and it looks like I'm getting the camry at the end of my 2nd year.  I probably won't have enough money saved up by the start of my 3rd year to pay for a new car.  So I decided to drive around the cam and buy a better car once I get out of college.  Wow, I can't believe I have three more weeks of school.  I'm really not looking back in going back home.  JMU is a lot of fun, I just want to stay here and do nothing.  As of right now, I do not have a job lined up.  I really need a job for the summer, if I don't get a good one, I guess I'll apply for a job at the mall.  Money is money... and I need it for summer.

Well as with school, things are setting down now.  No more hell weeks, just getting ready for finals and all.  Matthias and I are going to room together next year.  It's going to be tight, for right now we're at Chandler Hall, hopefully we'll be able to go back to C'peake or Potomac.  It would be nice to have A/C but Chandler is fine with me, since 4 out of my 5 classes will be near Chandler.  Yup, I've decided to change majors.... changing to CIS.  CS didn't go to waste, I get credit for taking CS 139 and 239.  It should be fun rooming with Matthias, it's going to be different, but nothing I can't get used to.  He'll be bring down his mustang, and he said he'll teach me how to drive stick(this will be my 2nd attempt to learn since I wasn't able to practice because brandon sold his celica).  So as for the rooming situation, I'm looking forward in it.  Can't believe I'm almost done with my 1st year... crazy.  Going to miss all my JMU friends and all.

As for summer, I don't really have big plans.  Hopefully I'll be working, but the Liu's and the Shyu's are planning a trip to Disney World.  It should be a lot of fun with just us 4... no parents... 5 days... =D  Well I'm done... I'll write again in a month...."

"event","Wow... spring break is finally here.  It's been a hell of a week and I'm just glad that it's finally done.  The week before spring break is pretty much a hell week for many people.  I had 2 papers, 1 quiz, 1 midterm, 2 labs, and 1 program due this week.  Everything other than CS work wasn't really too bad.  The program was the bitch, it took me forever and I didn't even finish.  A weeks worth of code in 40+ pages and it wasn't even completed.  I dunno... CS is a lot of work and the way that things are going I might not be accepted as a CS major.  With the way my professor teaches and grades, I would be lucky with a C in CS239.  My grades are pretty poor right now, I think my highest grades are in Calc and GWrit102... In some of my classes, I didn't do so well on the tests and so far they have been my own grades.  I'm definitely going to work a lot harder and study a lot harder once I get back from break.  I actually have a good amount of hw to do during break... so I'm going to be a nerd and do it during break.  So yeah, after not being able to complete the program, Joe and I talked about the possiblity of changing majors next semester.  It's kinda scary because we aren't sure what else we would like to major in.  I wouldn't mind majoring in CIS but I have a feeling it's a BS major.  I really don't mine CS... the programming is hard, but I can do it... but the way my professor is currently teaching and grading I won't have the GPA to make it in.  So yeah... this first half of the semester has been a wake up call for me.

Well I'm kinda glad that I'm home.  Time really flies when you're in college.  I can't believe we've already gone through 7 some weeks of classes.  I am glad that I get to relax and just enjoy a week somewhat off.  It just sucked that our spring break is after UVA/Tech's.  I really don't have anything planned for spring break.  I'm probably just going to bum around at home.

Well other than my hell weeks and all the work I've been doing, I've been trying to have fun while I can.  We went to Madison Grill on Wednesday for Justin's Birthday.  It was pretty fun, I got Justin a JMU shot glass and I hope he puts it into good use by taking shots of OJ =P  Last weekend we went out for my birthday.  Basically just chilled and had fun on friday and saturday.  It was a lot of fun and I have to thank all of you guys.  I've realized that a lot of people are born in Feburary or March, it's kinda crazy.  So other than my academic life, I'm doing great.  Playing intramural softball with friends once we get back from break.  Some of the rules are kinda gay, but it should be fun.  

Well this was suppose to be a short entry, but it turned out to be pretty lengthy.  I think I'll stop here... can't really think of what else to say.  For those people who's breaks are coming to a close: I hope everyone had a good break and those people who's breaks are just beginning: I hope everyone has a safe and fun break.  Take it easy... good night"

"event","It's been a really long time since I've posted a LJ.  Last time I posted was at the start of this semester.  So yeah... back at college... getting close to the middle of the semester.  Classes are more difficult now, but I'm getting used to it.  I got over bitching about the classes, I just want to get this semester over with.  So this weekend has been pretty cool.  Kristen came to JMU for the weekend, but ended up going back to UVA due to the snow storm and her sickness.  It was a lot of fun hanging out with her and everyone else.  We ended up doing a lot of fun things.

So we had our first blizzard of the year.  It snowed a lot here, but it was nothing compared to what people got back in northern virginia.  It has been really great walking around campus in the snow.  It's just amazing to look at the landscape around campus and how cool snow makes things look.  We didn't have classes today and we're not going to have any tomorrow.  A four day weekend, it's great... but going back to class on Wednesday is going to be horrible.  I'm currently done with 2 out of my 3, back to back hell weeks.  I have a psych and cs test this week.  So those should be interesting.  Tomorrow is going to be a big study day I guess, it's good that I got some homework done on Sunday.  So life back at college has been pretty good.  Life outside of class has been pretty great.  Just trying to enjoy it as much as I can.  But sometimes I feel like something is missing, but I don't know what it is.

Spring break starts the 2nd week of March.  I don't know what I'm going to do, I was thinking about chilling with hallmates at virginia beach and p-town, but I doubt my parents are going to let me drive down there.  Spring break really isn't far away.  I'm really surprised that time is going by so fast here.  Sunday was my mom's birthday and my birthday is like two weeks away.  I wasn't even aware of it until Megan brought it up.  I dunno... it's just weird... I've changed in a way... it's cool that my birthday is coming up, but I'm not really excited about it.  Maybe I'm just getting old or something... This year I don't really want anything... just like what happened for Xmas and all.  So yeah... just rambling random thoughts.  Sometimes I don't even know what I want anymore... maybe it's because I currently have all I need and I don't need anything.  I've gotten so much into a routine now.  The same routine of going to classes... coming back and doing hw... enjoying life... dunno... just weird I guess.  

I say ""weird"" and ""dunno"" a lot in my LJ posts.  And I continue to spit out random thoughts.  If anyone is interested, download some music from Niki Barr.  Pretty good artist, attended JMU for a year then left to pursue her singing career.  I saw her in concert here at JMU with Brian.  Music isn't too bad... she's sorta like  Michelle Branch.  So yeah... intramural basketball... we should call ourselves the ""touchables"" because we weren't really untouchable during the season.  1-4... and our only win was from a forefit.  Playoffs start thursday, hopefully we'll advance... but whatever, it was fun while it lasted.  I am going to do intramural basketball again next year.  It's also cool that I'm ""coaching"" Megan's intramural team.  Her team is pretty cool, with a lot of talent.  And fun just to hang out with friends and watch a game.  Probably going to play intramural softball with everyone later this semester.  It should be a lot of fun.  So yeah... I hope everyone is doing well.  Enjoy the snow and have fun.  Off to shower... I guess I'll post again in a month =P"

I wanna go back to JMU for the college life, but not for the classes.  I am not looking forward to my classes...  My first class is at 11am on Monday, which isn't too bad.  But I got 15mins to get from one side of campus to the other...  I wish they could've given us more time to get settled back into college before classes start.  

Well overall winter break was fun.  It was nice to go back to work and make some extra money.  I hope I find a better job for summer.  Hanging out with everyone was very enjoyable... a lot of new memories... (nuhuhuhuhuh =P)  I guess the only down fall to break was getting my wisdom teeth pulled.  I got all 4 pulled on Monday.  It wasn't that painful, but the swelling sucked.  Eating crappy food for a couple days got frustrating.  But things are good now, just gotta clean out my mouth with this water gun they gave me...  

Eric had a get together today.  It was a lot of fun, Eric's house has a lot of goodies...  Played darts and all... pretty fun.  It was nice to see everyone for the final time for a couple of months.  I guess I have only spring break to look foward to.  If anyone wants to come down to JMU, IM me or call me up.  Right now, it feels like I'm going to college for the first time again... It's kinda weird.  Well I guess this is it... I guess I better start packing, like everyone else.  I hope everyone has a good spring semester/2nd quarter.  Take it easy..."

"event","Hmm... what day is today?  Tuesday?  I guess I'm breaking my normal routine of updating my LJ every 3 weeks at home.  Right now nothing is really going on.  Woke up an hour ago and I've been working on my GCOM speech.  I wanted to do my speech on traffic accidents, but I didn't have enough information.  So I decided to do it on sleep.  It interested me in Psych last year, so I thought it would be a nice topic.  But I don't know what to focus my speech on, I have all this information... I guess I'll speak about how we deal with sleep or something.  Speaking about sleep... I think I slept for 10 hours.  I guess it helped me clear my head.  

Well last weekend was Parent's Weekend.  My parents came around noon on Saturday.  I showed them around campus and I think my dad was really impressed by the campus and school... I don't know why he was impressed now.  I've been here for more than a month.  And he's seen the campus about four times.  But it was fun being able to see and hang out with my family.  Well, last week was probably one of my best weeks here.  After finishing my two tests last Wednesday, the weekend basically started for me.  My Hall and I started playing Madden 2003 a lot and we've been having tournaments basically all night.  It's funny how much trash talking we do.  Well Kyle our RA got us hooked on Knockout 2002.  It's such a sweet game... so we started talking about boxing tournaments... both on PS2 and in real life.    So yeah... Brian preformed at TDU friday night.  It was pretty cool, we played football before his big performance.  Two drunk guys joined in on the game... it was funny.  

Well I am not looking forward to the end of this week.  I have a test on Thursday in GBUS and gotta do my speech in GCOM on Friday.  Got to work on my programming assignment in CS... blah I don't like work =P I want to be lazy.  Well I hope all the UVA people enjoyed their fall break.  Well I guess I should return to my work...the weekend needs to be here..."

"event","Well I'm home for the weekend.  My house seems really different... I love the feel of carpet and not having to worry about wearing scandals in the shower.  And the internet is a lot faster than JMU's struggling network.  It felt kinda weird coming home, I guess it didn't take long for me to get used to college and college life.  But now since I'm home, it's cool.  My sister keeps saying that I've changed...  I don't know what she's talking about.  

This week went by really fast.  I'm starting to enjoy all my classes, so the academic factor of college is getting better.  Even though the week went by fast, it was sad and depressing.  I'm sorry about Jacob.  I didn't know Jacob that well, but I had the pleasure of meeting him.  He was a great guy.  Originally, I was coming back home for Alice's Birthday.  But after the accident, I also wanted to attend the service.  Thanks Mike for driving Megan and I back home.  

So Mike got to campus around 1.  I took him to festival for lunch mmm... Cranberry Farms... and all Mike did was critize JMU's campus... bastard.  So while I was finishing up on my last class, he went to the mall.  So, we got home around 6:30 and I went out to dinner with my family.  We talked about a lot of things and I told them about college.  We needed up at Price Club getting more stuff for college.  I forgot/needed a lot of stuff.  I still need a TV... hopefully I can get one before I go back.  I'm not asking for much, just a TV for me to watch football and to play PS2.  Speaking of football, I wish I could've been able to attend the JMU football game, oh well.  Justin, Sarah, and Ed better be there!  This weekend looks busy, hopefully I'll be able to hang out with everybody before I leave.  Blah, I didn't know that it rained so much here.  And since my dad's out of the country, nobody has been mowing the lawn.  So my mom wants me to mow the thick lawn.  Well, I don't know when's the next time I'm coming back.  But if you guys are interested in visiting or seeing what's college like, give me a call or something.  Well I'm off.  I hope everyone is having fun at school and enjoying life.  Take care and be safe.

<b>HAPPY BIRTHDAY ALICE</b>

"event","Hmm... seven more days till I leave for college.  It's very scary realizing summer is also over... and where did it all go?  To tell you the truth, I do not know what to expect.  I am glad to be able to make my own choices and create and build friendships.  I am going to look forward in hanging out with everyone though.  And no... I don't have everything ready for college =P  My parents are going to visit me again on that Friday after I move in, and they'll bring stuff that I forgot.  And I already got invited to an apartment party and set a day to come back home =P  and I haven't even gotten to college yet.  Well I got my dorm information a couple of weeks ago... and I don't have a roommate.  After thinking and talking to people about it... there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages of not having a roommate.  I think the thing that bothers me the most is being so far away from everyone... and not being able to experience the advantages of a roommate.  So my first bill from JMU came a couple of days ago... I was really surprised to see it...  My mom gave me a lecture earlier and it really made me think.  She never realized how much college really costed... she has always heard parents complain about it, but never seen a bill.  It was a good idea that my parents did the prepaid program or the bill would've been much larger.  But my mom told me to really be serious with college and do well because it's costly.  Hmm... sometimes I take money for regranted...

Well my  aunt, uncle, and cousin came last week.  It was really nice to be able to have the house to myself for a couple of days.  I really enjoyed the quiet house and the feeling of being independent.  So my cousin ended up getting a townhouse near Mason, so she isn't living with us.  But I think my mom is going to try and get her to come over as much as possible.  It's been an interesting week... the Liu-Shyu Clan painted their garages... and we have a poopy green colored garage now...  I saw a lot of movies... thank you Justin... the dirty latino.  And just chilled a lot.

I took my cousin to Mason today.  Man the campus is a lot larger than I thought.  I really don't like the speedbumps =P I couldn't really see them.  Afterwards, I spent a couple of hours at the mall with Rita.  It was a lot of fun... especially seeing all these guys check her out =P  <i>I'm going to miss you a lot Rita!  Good luck and have fun at India.</i>  I really like the friendship necklaces that we got.  So... I have racquetball with the dirty latino and our TV dinner party to look forward to this week.  I hope everything is going well with everyone... I'm going to miss all of you guys.  And I don't know how I'm going to handle not seeing my family at college...  It's crazy to think that we've completed high school and now we're going into something totally new and different.  As you can see... I've been thinking a lot... I've been thinking way too much...  But good luck to everyone...  enjoy life!"

"event","It's kinda scary how my sister keeps saying that there's 32 more days of summer left.  For me, it's going to be even less.  I've really enjoyed this summer, even though I haven't been doing much.  I've really enjoyed relaxing and not worrying about stuff.  This past week, I've been hanging out with friends alot.  It's been a lot of fun, especially the car rides with Justin.  And of course, seeing my BEST FRIEND =P  I finally quit work today.  Now I can really enjoy my summer... even though I have to go to JMU on the 21st... which doesn't give me a lot of time.  Time really flew by, I remember counting down the weeks till I quit.  And now it's here, I'm happy.  I really liked what one of my bosses told me as I left today.  I have a lot of respect for him now.  He said that I've been a person that has had a profound impact on the company.  Both of my bosses told me to keep in touch and said I could work while I was in college.  I'm probably not goin to do that... but my parents keeps saying that I could go back next summer if I don't have a job.  I hope that doesn't happen, I wanna work for a new and bigger company.  But I've learned a lot and gained a lot of experience from these past 17 months that I've worked there.  I was really surprised how well I knew the software too.  (PDASecure... Ed...? =P)

Justin and I finally completed a goal that we've set for a long time now.  We stole a traffic barrel.  I was goin to keep it at my house, but my parents found out and totally freaked.  So I gave it to Justin to keep... 

IHOP was fun today.  It made me realize that I'm not totally ready for college and time is closing down.  I hope I can finish the jmu book by the 21st.  So I've been playing a lot of counterstrike lately.  I'm ranked 39 out of 200 people.  Haha I play way too much...  But I really enjoy some of the people who play on the server... I wanna see if I could out rank Mike, since I have a lot of free time to play.  Well my cousin is coming on Monday.  She's coming from Taiwan and she's going to attend Mason.  We still don't know if shes going to live near the campus or at my house.  I guess that'll be interesting... even though I won't be home after the year.  So my family is going on a tour next week.  That leaves the whole house  all to me for a couple of days.  I'm really going to enjoy it.  This LJ post has not been constant... sorry for talking about random things.  Well I hope everyone is having a great summer... I hope I can hang out with everyone.  I'm going to make the best out of this last month.  Later

Blah... I hate bugs... I'm getting raped by them."

"event","Well Prom was yesterday, it was a lot of fun.  I think it was a lot better than last year.  I didn't go into work yesterday and I didn't take advantage of the extra sleep because after waking up at 8:20, I couldn't go back to sleep.  For the most of the day, I sat and did chores.  In the afternoon, I went around picking up stuff and driving my sister and her friends around... driving a car with 3 other middle school girls suck.  After doing all that, I got home and got ready for prom.  My dad and sister took pictures and helped me get ready.  I drove the MDX =D and I went to pick up Danny.  I got lost in his neighborhood.  But after 5 minutes of driving around, I accidently found his house(Danny has a cool dog).  We went over to Megan's house.  We were the first guys there and we waited for everyone to show up.  Once the girls got ready, we took mad pictures and left for Maggiano's.  We were running late, so we ate dinner around 10.  The Limo driver took us to the dance instead of Maggiano's so that made us even later.  Maggiano's is a great place to eat, I think we had a 5 course dinner.  I hope Kathy and I could go back there.  There was so much food, and all of it was good.  So we got to the dance at 11:45ish, and we took our couple pictures and started to dance.  It kinda sucked missing most of the dance, but it was still fun.  We saw a lot of people and took a lot of pictures.  After the dance, we went back to Megan's to change and went bowling.  Bowling was pretty cool, Nibe and I did speed bowling after the people next to us left.  So by the time we got back to Megan's, Kathy and I acquired a nice candle thingie from the dance and this balloon thing at the bowling alley =P  At Megan's house, we just chilled and I watched Sarah and Danny play GTA3 in black and white.  We never found out why it was in black and white.  At 5, I dropped off Kathy at home and I went home.  At first, I couldn't fall asleep and thought about not staying up.  I guess after 30 minutes of prom thinking, I fell asleep.  I actually only got less than 5 hours of sleep, but I feel fine.  Prom was really cool, a great thing to somewhat close Senior year.

I didn't do much today, basically sat in front of the computer and uploaded pictures from prom (http://www.geocities.com/shyuperman/)  In the afternoon, I played ball with Mike and Alice.  Then I went to return my tux and get dinner.  I really don't feel like doing math hw, actually I don't feel like doing anything.  Mike was right in saying that it's a lot harder to do work after prom.  Wow, 3-4 more weeks of school left.  This school year is almost to an end... it's really scary how time flies.  But this year has been full of great times and memories.  Powder Puff and HC seems so long ago.  

Well tomorrow is an A day... 8th period SOLs.  It'll be cool, Mr Lawwill might take us to Rocky Run Creek.  I just hope that we don't do that much in school now.  I think teachers should stop trying to teach new stuff to Seniors.  Well... three day weekend coming up... I think it's going to be busy with the birthday parties we're going to plan... I can't wait.  Well... later"

"event","Hey, don't worry... I'm still alive.  It's been almost one month since I've written in my LJ.  Sorry, I didn't feel like writing in it.  Well, things have been the same, nothing really new.  Today was pretty fun.  Ed and I slept in because we have our AP Comp Sci test.  It was really nice to get extra sleep and just go to two classes.  The comp sci test was an ass raper... no surprise.  The multiple choice section wasn't too bad, but I didn't answer the ones I didn't know.  The free response was the hardest, I had no clue what was going on.  I'm praying for a 2... I need a 4 to get credit hours for jmu.  I really don't see that happening.  They gave us too much time on that test.  I didn't go to sleep, but I did watch other people sleep through the whole test and draw.  Most people knew they were goin to fail, so they didn't really bother.  I had 1 hour of free time during the free response, so I drew this pretty cool looking eclipse.  It had a body kit, altezzas, exhaust, and spoiler...I amazed myself.  I was really mad because I couldn't keep it.  

I took the English AP on Monday.  I guess it wasn't <i>too</i> bad.  I'm really glad I got english and comp sci over this week.  I still have APES, gov, and psych next week.  I'm really not worried, they're pretty easy tests compared to compsci and english.  It's just going to be really hard on Wednesday, having gov in the morning then APES in the afternoon.  But AP week is real nice.  I haven't been doing a lot of hw... pretty relaxing.  

Well, I just got home from the gym.  Worked out and play a little racquetball with my dad.  I'm probably going to spend most of my night finding hidden packages in GTA3 =P  I can't believe prom is going to be next week.  I really can't wait and I can't wait till APs are over.  It's going to be a big load off.  I'm definately going to update my LJ after prom next week.  Well... one more day till the weekend.  Gotta go through a day of school and work.  Hopefully it'll be easy."

"event","It's Sunday...Look how quickly the three day weekend ended.  Another fast and busy weekend.  3rd quarter is finally over, and I can't believe that 4th quarter is already here.  Theres only 2 more months of school left... crazy eh?  

Thursday-  The last Senior Skip Day and again I didn't skip.  Stupid A days... I had government and English.  Ms Bednarz forgot to give us the Tartuffe test on Tuesday, so we had to take it.  She was actually kinda nice and let us do the essay in bullet form.  The day went by all right, Murphy let us have B and D lunch... that was a lot of fun.  And Lawwill took us outside to look at the trees and etc.  I guess the four day week went by pretty fast.  We had a SEA meeting after school... same old same old.  After school, Megan, Kathy, Ed, and I went to the Mall and Total Crafts to look for fake tattoos.  We wanted to see the reaction of Trey when Ed professed his love for Megan.  =P  Kathy and I went to Boston Market afterwards and pick up Ed's Bday gift.  Then we went to Walney Pond.  We walked around and saw a family fishing... I had fun 52 =).

Friday-  Blah... Went through four hours of work.  Apparently there's a deadline on Monday.  So they had me do a butt load of stuff.  The bosses wanted me to go to work on Sunday and Saturday.  And I told them hell no for Sunday.  After a long day at work, I went to the doctors to get my college physical.  It was pretty painless... I got a test for TB and I have to go back tomorrow to get it checked up.  I have to get a shot but there's a one month wait list for it.  I went over to Eric's early for the Prom planning.  I got to mess with some people on IM with his sn =P  Once Jake, Karen and Meg arrived, we got to talking and planning.  The planning turned out pretty well.  Trey, Jake, Karen, and I went to Chick-Fil-a afterward.  Great food... Ed: I think it's better than Wendy's

Saturday- Ed and I went to work for four long hours.  After work, I waited 45mins to get a haircut.  Then it was Ed's Birthday party at Red Robin.  It was fun and cool.  I had the Banzi Burger... it was actually pretty good.  Dinner was fun, got to mess with Matt and Eric B while they worked.  Ed professed his love for Karen, Kathy, and Megan afterwards... wasn't expecting that, but it was really funny.  We went to Centreville Mini Golf and played putt putt in the rain.  It was my first time driving back to my old neighborhood.  A lot has changed... it was kinda depressing.  After making our rounds, we went over to Meg's.  Thats when the fun started =P  Justin and I were driving pretty reckless =D  We raced and Justin kicked my ass because he has a bigger engine.  But it was great =)  At Meg's we watched Ed's Bday movie... great times.

So today, is the big hw day.  I think I have to mow the lawn and start my gov court case.  I would like to be able to go to the gym.  I uploaded pictures from Ed's Bday - http://www.geocities.com/shyuperman/ last night.  I hope everyone had a great three day weekend.  I hope this coming week is going to be easy on the students =P  I'll leave you guys with a thought:  (Later)

<i>For the past couple days I've been wondering... why do some people not think about their actions?  And the hurtful results from it?  Is it because they're too into themselves to see what's really going on?  Can anyone answer that?  And how come nice people sometimes get burned for being nice... and that's not right.  All right, I'll just leave it at that.</i>"

"event","Four day week.. I doubt I'm goin to skip on Thursday.  Stupid how it's goin to be an A day... stupid government and stupid english!  Speaking of those classes, I finished writing my satire earlier.  Apparently Ms Bednarz has been trying to teach this quarter.  She has been giving us a butt load of tests and stuff to do.  It's really hurting my grade, it was an A and after bombing the tests... I'm probably getting a B.  I just finished ""studying"" for government.  All I did was look through the chapter looking for the terms... I hope I'll do well on the quiz tomorrow.  I'll probably look at my notes again.  

Well last week was okay I guess. School was school, but Friday we went to Ruby Tuesdays for Carrie's birthday.  It was fun, afterwards us guys went to play at BestBuy.  Worked really sucked... it was just a bad day.  I really want to get a new job, for the past couple of days I've been applying for internships.  I hope I get one, I really can't stand working at the company anymore.  Saturday Ed and I went to JMU.  It was really cold in the morning.  It's a really nice campus.  Ed and I bought shirts and walked around the campus.  Ed commented on how there are more girls than guys at the campus.  Well I mailed out my desposit for JMU yesterday.  I'm looking forward in going and the drive to JMU isn't that bad.  Ed and I drove around downtown and went to visit the mall.  The mall is all right, it's a lot smaller than Fair Oaks.  It was interesting... there are a lot of latinos, african americans, and white people in Harrisonburg... and I only saw 3 azians, but they were working at a chinese fast food place at the mall =D  After getting back from JMU, Ed, Mike, Alice, my sister, I  and of course Kathy ...went to Outback for dinner... it was fun... I drove the MDX =P very nice car I do have to say.  After dinner, we came back to my house and played PS2.  Sunday was a homework day... I also went to the gym.  I haven't gone for two weeks.  I needed a good work out.

Well I have a butt load of work to do tonight.  I still need to study for APES.  I heard from justin and tery that it was easy.  Hmm... tomorrow is going to be a hell of a day.  This coming weekend looks nice.  I'm planning on working Friday *_* then go get my college physical afterwards.  Then go to work again on Saturday.  After work the group is probably meeting up to talk about prom.  Then Ed's birthday party.  And sunday will be... the hw day.

Well I should get to work... adios"

Well, It's sad... spring break is basically over.  And I really got to enjoy two days of the break.  I'm still kinda sick, just have a stuffed up nose and I'm coughing.  It really sucked being sick for five days of the break, but I really enjoyed yesterday.  It was a great way to end spring break.  A bunch of us went down to DC to have some fun.  It was fun and a very nice day.  Ed and I went to Giant to pick up lunch and we went to Kristen's house to make PB&J.  Then we went to pick up Justin and went to the metro station.  After being in DC for 4 hours, we went back to Kristens.  Kristen was a great tour guide =P  We hung around there.  For dinner, we went to Rocky Run Grill.  Jake had his fun with the straws =P  After dinner, we went over to Justin's.  His house is like a giant toy store.  Ed, Justin, and I got to play NBA JAM TE, such a great game.  I got to play the new 007 game.  I really didn't like it.  It wasn't the same as Goldeneye on n64 or Perfect Dark.  So after a couple hours of playing video games we went home.  My sister told me that Maryland beat Kansas.  Maryland vs Indiana... it's going to be a great game.  Well back to Justin getting pooped on... he was sitting in front of the Air and Space Muesuem and a bird pooped on him =P  It was great =P  

Well yesterday was also fun because it was my second time seeing Kathy during the break.  On Tuesday, we went out for our two month.  We saw Ice Age... it was a pretty good movie and afterwards we ate at Olive Garden.  I was really sick then, so we didn't get to do much.  Well... UVA I guess, is going to be here on Monday.  Thats going to be a big rejection.  I did get mail from tech... and I got wait listed.  I was kinda surprised and sad.  Tech has been my dream school for the past year and I'm probably not going to tech.  Under the situation I'm in, I'm probably going to JMU.  My mom is making me consider going to MASON, I really don't want to do that.  During the break, I had time to think about college, I sorta got worried about getting home sick.  So Mason is still one of my choices.  One of the things I was worried about was not having any friends going to JMU.  I thought it would suck not knowing anyone the first year of college, but after talking to Megan and Justin, they told me that they're probably going to JMU.  It's cool! Dirty Latino and Mom =D  Still sucks about tech... sorry Mike, the plans we talked about aren't going to happen...  Well I have until May 1st, I still have some time to think.

Today is probably the big hw day for everyone.  I have B hw... well I have to read that stupid book for english... Justin, Danny, Wayne did you guys read it? ... ... ...  Well I'm going to enjoy this last day.  I hope everyone had a great break.  Enjoy it while it lasts =P"

"event","Blah, I've been sick for the past two days... not a great way to start off spring break.  I spent most of the day in bed, I didn't go to work.  I could hardly stand up this morning.  I don't know if I'm going to work tomorrow.  I'm probably going to go after my dentist appointment.  

Other than being sick, my break has been all right I guess.  Saturday was cool.  Ed, Scott, and I played in Jess's basketball tournament.  It was a lot of fun, a very good work out.  

I got into JMU today.  Now, I'm just waiting for tech.  Well it's good news because I'm not going to mason.  Makes me very happy =P  Well dinner time later...

"event","It's been awhile since I've written in my LJ.  It's been two weeks now.  Well... things are good.  I really cannot believe spring break is going to be here in three days.  Time is really going by fast.  Well Justin and Ed came over after school today.  The dirty latino helped me beat most of the sick scores in Tony Hawk 3.  He's really good, I finally saw how to free style.  Looks really hard, a lot of balancing and Justin is really good at that.  Thanks man for helping me out.  We also played Grand Theft Auto 3.  It's great, a couple weeks ago I found out that you could shoot down the police choppers with  the rocket launcher.  That makes the game so much fun now =P  Afterwards, Ed dropped off Justin and I had to go to the post office to next day my application for an internship at the Smithsonian.  I was surprised I was able to finish before the due date.  My mom told me to pick up the application last week and I had less than a week to finish it.  The application required some time.  It wasn't too bad, I could've mailed it earlier, but Ms. Patey wasn't in school on Monday.  Haha thanks Ed and Justin for your efforts after school =P  The internship sounds pretty cool, I basically work for the Freer Gallery of Art.  The position I signed up for was for the Archives.  I would be working with archivists in entering stuff into their database.  I would have to work with a digital camera and adobe photoshop.  It seems pretty cool, and my mom wants me to do it for the experience.  And it'll be cool because not everyday this opportunity occurs.  I would work for 6 weeks, 5 days a week, around 7 hours and I get $1,500 in the end.  They wanted four azian descent seniors, so hopefully I'll get it.  

Well nothing has been really happening.  Last friday we had a <b>Top Ramen</b> party at Megan's it was great =P  Remember, spoilers keep the car down! =P  Then we went to see palooza.  It was my first palooza and it was pretty tight.  We got ice cream afterwards, Ed got Kathy and I into Wendy's =P  I'm really hoping that this week goes by fast.  I really don't have anything planned for spring break.  We're hoping to be able to start and finish our music video.  It's going to be tight and fun.  I'm probably going to work a couple days and get lots of sleep of course.  Wow, It'll be my one year working at Applied Technologies.  One year... time does go by really fast.  Speaking of work, I'm working on Wednesdays now with Ed.  It's a lot more fun because I have someone to talk to and someone to play chess with =P  Well the rest of the week is going to be somewhat busy, have a quiz or test each day.  Hmm... prom is coming up in like two months... It's goin to be great.  Well, I'm getting a cell phone.  After asking my mom on and off for more than a year, my mom finally said yes last night.  I just have to pay for the phone and fees.  Since I'm goin to need one in college, my parents will pay for the fees when I'm in college.  I'm probably going to go with Sprint, which is a pretty good service.  My mom has been using Sprint for a couple years now, with her brick cell phone.  The cell I'm probably goin to get is the SPH-N200 (samsung).  It's a really nice phone, been doing my research on it.  Johan had one and I was lookin at it during Champ a couple months ago.  Mike also was talking about it and I think it's a reasonable phone for Sprint.  Here is a picture and info: http://www.cnet.com/wireless/0-1923403-8-7722012-1.html?tag=txt I'm probably going to go take a look at the deals and such this weekend.  It's something to look forward to.  I don't which color to get... blue or silver...  I might just go for the blue.  

Well it's been interesting hearing about the Vtech letters.  Congrats Nelly, we'll party if I get in.  Still no news from them.  Oh well, I still have 2 weeks.  I know I'm goin to get rejected from UVA, but I have a good chance with tech and jmu.  I guess we'll see.  Eric C. has been freaking out these past two days... 

I've gotten interested in Switchfoot.  It's a pretty good band considering they're a Christian band.  They have all right music.  You guys probably noticed that I changed the color to my LJ.  I was thinking about changing the format, but none of them look good.  Well... I think I wrote enough... later

"event","Wow, it's been a great weekend so far.  It really sucks that it's coming to an end.  Sundays now are my homework days, so I'm going to do hw and go to the gym tomorrow.  Well I just got home from Karen's Bday party.  <b>Happy Birthday Karen.</b>  The party was lots of fun.  Well here is a little summary of what has happened these past three days:

Thursday:

School was boring, it really felt like a Friday.  After school Ed and I went to Justin's concert.  It was pretty cool, it was our second strings concert.  The whole time we bothered Fano and Justin.  No Code Red this time, but Ed had his ROOT BEER.  After the concert we ran into smitty and he told us that Mr Lawwill's and Garrison's room caught on fire.  When we got to the school we noticed a lot of water outside and we didn't know why.  So we were stunned to hear the news.

Friday:

School really sucked, Government was even worse.  It was great during lunch, we had Matt(aka Trey) drink a mix of stuff for $4, a coupon to Chick Fila and a pound cake.  It was great, it was mixed by the latino cook.  I spent some time and finally got surround sound hooked up for my PS2... so tight.  After school, Kathy threw a birthday party for me.  We went to Rocky Run Grill and ice skating at Reston Town Center.  It was great, thanks everyone for coming.  Thank you Kathy =)  You guys are great friends.  Rocky Run Grill is a really nice place.  Ice skating was fun.  Ed and Jess kicked ass skating.  It was interesting towards the end, a bunch of drunk workers were skating and doing some crazy stuff.  Haha it was great at the end of the night.  But I know it's a night that Megan and Trey will remember =P  Man, it's so weird, I'm 18.  Time goes by really fast.  Linda's card brought back a lot of old old memories.  Thanks.  Man, 18... I can do so many more things now.  No more stupid driving laws that nobody cares about.

Today:

Woke up and I went to work.  My boss said that he couldn't get a hold of me, to tell me not to go to work.  Both bosses didn't have any work for me to do.  So I responded to the tech questions for a hour and I left.  When I got home, Mike, my sister, and I went to Dulles Town Center to go shopping.  I got my <b>ZUMspeed</b> t-shirt.  It's great, I wanted to get more, but I decided not to.  I might get more shirts later.   This is the back of the shirt that I got:  http://www.zumspeed.com/cgis/inddes.cgi?pic=2311.gif&title=2311-Asian+Shrine&med=1  It's sweet, Asian Shrine =P  Well, I went to Karen's surprise birthday party.  It was lots of fun.  We hung out and played pool.  We played the pool game that we learned at Eileen/Maureen's house.  It was tight.



Well I'm going to try to upload as many pictures from Karen's Birthday and Justin's concert as possible.  I'll probably finish the rest tomorrow, since I'm goin to procrastinate on doing hw =P

Later, thanks you guys for friday.  Happy Birthday Karen.

"event","The three day weekend is over... way too fast and I don't want to go to school.  The three day weekend was pretty cool.  I just got a butt load of work to do this week.  I got a load of quizes, tests, and projects.  Today was fun, had a late lunch with friends.  Gotta love chinese food =P  Well my mom came home on Saturday.  Her flight was delayed 1 hour because one of the passengers on her flight had to be searched.  She came back on her birthday, so a couple of our family friends threw her a surprise birthday party.  Things are different with my mom home, she doesn't like me on the phone that much and me going out.  She keeps telling me that I'm wasting time on the phone.  I guess things were more laid back with my mom out of town.  =P oh well.  Spent most of my weekend with Kathy or talking to Kathy.  =)  I wish I could spend more time with her.

Sony finally got ps2 memory cards in stock, so I bought it during class on Thursday.  It took them 4 days to have it shipped to PA.  Hopefully in 1-2 days, I'll be getting my memory card.  It really sucks not being able to save.  Well Justin impressed me with his tony hawk latino skillz.  He was pulling 100,000+ combos.  I need to practice my manuals and unlock more stages once the memory card comes.  Speaking of the latino, we played racquetball last night.  Lots of fun, it's been awhile since Ed, Justin, and I played.  But it was great.

Arg... Hamlet sucks!  That stupid English take home test.  Stupid Hamlet talking to himself and complaining about his mother.  Haha I really need to get further with Catch 22... I don't see that happening.  Well... I have nothing more to say... thank you *bows*  =P"

Today was great.  School was all right, I was really glad that the week is over.  The full week of school actually went by fast, but today was kinda slow.  After school was when I had the most fun.  Carrie, Megan, Eric, Justin, Ed and I hung out at the playground near Eric's house.  It was fun, we talked and had fun.  The best moment of the day was when Justin jumped on Ed's car while Ed was driving away and slipped off.  Ed, Justin, and I were laughing our asses off.  So I had most of them over at my house to hang and play Grand Theft Auto 3.  We had a blast playing GTA3.  Yup, I got my PS2 on Wednesday.  I also got into George Mason, pretty happy.  I'm glad I have my back-up school, I just have to wait for Tech or JMU.  My cousin from Taiwan also got into Mason, so if I go to Mason, I'll be going with my cousin too.  That should be interesting.  Back to my PS =P I wasn't able to get a memory card so I can't save!  I'm going to trade in my n64 tomorrow for a memory card and Tony Hawk 3(I know I'm going to get ripped off with the value of my n64).  Kathy had dinner with my Dad and sister today.  I think it went pretty well.  Afterwards we watched Fast and the Furious on DVD (got it free when I bought my PS2)  I really enjoyed spending time with Kathy(<i>Thinking of you 52)</i>, had lots of fun.  Freaky thing was, while waiting in front of Outback, our Psych teacher was picking up chinese and saw us.  We were surprised that it was her... I dunno... I think it was one of those things that you had to be there to understand.

Well my mom is coming back in a week.  Time really goes by fast.  Saturday and Sunday... I think I'm going to be really busy.  Mike came back for the weekend.  Hmm... who needs sleep?  and I don't wanna go to work tomorrow!! but I get my paycheck... =P  Well I'm off later."

"event","Came back from Nibe's a couple minutes ago.  We played SNES the whole time, it was interesting to see Pilotwings and StarFox on SNES.  Happy birthday Jake.  We went to Red Robin for dinner, first time that I went and it was cool.  Matt served us more than our waitress, and we gave him a good tip.  For the past week, I've been trying to get the A Walk to Remember soundtrack for my sister, but its been sold out, but today kathy helped me find it at Sam Goody.  CDs at Sam Goody are too expensive, I might just have my sister order the CD online. 

Tomorrow is already Sunday, weekends are too short.  I dunno if I can last full weeks of school until spring break.  Tomorrow, I'm probably going to do hw and go to the gym.  I'll be watching the Super Bowl with my Dad and sister.  Sorry I can't go to Nibe's party, but I think I should spend time with family tomorrow.  I hope my mom is having fun in Taiwan.  Actually, with my mom out of the country, we're doing a lot better than I thought.  Things are kinda interesting with my dad in charge.  We're splitting up all the chores and my dad just seems more laid back.

Well lately in my life... I've been doing all right with school I guess.  Really don't want to do anymore work.  Congrats to Serena, Justin, Eric C, Rabia and Megan in getting into colleges.  Mason said that they mailed me their decision... so hopefully I'll be getting it on Monday.  It's nice to get something from one college, so then I know I have a back up and I get my ps2 earlier =D  PS2!  So recently, I guess my life has been all right.  I enjoy spending my time with Kathy... happy one week...52  =) 

I've actually been working a lot more since Ed started.  I just don't like how my bosses handle things.  They always waiting till the last minute to tell us to write manuals.  Ed knows what I'm talking about.  

So.. the psych midterm on Friday was ify...  

I usually have an idea what I'm going to write for entries, but when I do write them, I totally forget...  So my entries are totally random.

Yum... chinese food =P Justin, Ed, and I played racquetball for a hour, which was fun.  We always have fun playing racquetball.  So while eating my cereal in the morning, I realized that the milk tasted kinda funny and after I finished the cereal, I realized the milk was bad, so I was throwing up.  Not a good thing before leaving home for the SATs.  The test was all right I guess... stupid deception essay.  I might take it again, depending on my score, for jmu placement.  I'm most likely going to take it again.

Really glad that we have a 4 day weekend.  The rest of the day, I spent with Kathy.  We went ice skating and watched <i>A Walk to Remember</i>.  I had fun =)  Yesterday was kinda uneventful.  It was Senior skip day and I didn't skip.  Stupid government test!!  The test was confusing and EVIL!  After school Ed and I went to work.  Work has been a lot better with Ed.  Ate at subway afterwards and paid Danielle a visit at work.  

Plans for the rest of the 4 day weekend:  Sleep... Sleep... =D  Play tennis with Linda tomorrow... hopefully.  Go to the library with Kathy to review for our Psych mid-term on Monday.  Work and hw on Tuesday.  And spend time with my mom before she leaves for Taiwan on Tuesday.

"event","Weekends should really be longer.  It's been awhile since I've written in my livejournal.  Last night was fun, we went to Outback because Mike was going back to college.  Normally we go to Outback when Mike comes home and goes back to college.  I'm going to miss you Mike, have fun at college.  Now who do I go to for help with AP comp sci =P  After dinner, Kathy and I hung out at the mall and at Ed's house.  We watched a very interesting/nasty episode of South Park.  Last night was fun.  Friday night, I hung out with Jess and Eric.  It was fun, we hung out at the mall for like 15mins before it closed and we went to hooters.  I offically go to hooters for the water =P  On the way to hooters we passed a car that got pulled over and realized it was ashwin.  We called him and he said the cop said he was doing 90 down route 50.  We all had a good laugh.  So hooters, hooters is too hyped up (haha sorry danny, you'll probably bitch me out)  I dunno, like every 5mins, I would smell this weird smell.  And there were lots of people smoking and such.  It's a perfect place for red necks =P  I guess I'm over the hooters hype, and I didn't get a t-shirt, didn't think it was worth it.  So the whole time, eric and I were watching the wizards game.  They got raped, I know, disappointed by the way they've been playing.  But Jess had fun and thats good.

This week was all right I guess.  It actually went faster than I thought, took a lot of tests and quizes.  Other than the busy work, I enjoyed the week.  Hopefully this week of school goes by fast.  3 day weekend!  I'm going to enjoy that.  Actually this week is going to be an important one, jmu letters are mailed out on the 15th. =\  I got an email from them last night, from the jmu bull dog, it was kinda stupid actually.  They basically said to remember to mail the application by the 15th, and if I already mailed it, I have nothing to worry about.  Well I mailed my application in during October... this might be a bad sign because stupid College Board was too slow in mailing in my transcript.  And jmu maybe bump me down to regular decision.  =\  I hope all goes well...

So, Sundays are the only days I get to sleep in.  And sundays is the day I do all my hw.  And now theres no more Redskins games.  And right now theres nobody on IM this early to talk to.  I finally found out how to use different pictures for journal posts.  You like the supra?  =P

Woke up at 8 today, to go paintballing with Mike and his vtech friends(actually could've gone snowboarding too).  Once we got there, we had a hour to wait, so we went to Bob Evans for breakfast.  And afterwards, the idea of running in the cold and having frozen paintballs hit us wasn't appealing.  So we decided to go home and play PS2 =P  It's interesting, if you drive on route 50, after South Riding, the road becomes 2 lanes, and it's really hickish out there.  We basically passed Meg's house 4 times driving back and forth =P  Was kinda disappointed that we didn't go paintballing, but it was too cold!  I didn't want to get even more sick.  So Chris Fano's brother drove us back to Mike's house, so we could ride in his new 2002 Nissan Altima.  Sweet ass car, he got it 2 days ago?  It was really sweet.  We went to bestbuy to buy Tony Hawk 3 and we played PS2 all afternoon.   Tony Hawk is a really good game.  I want my PS2!!! =P  

Wow tomorrow is New Years Eve, sad that break is almost over...  A lot of good and bad things happened over break, but it's been fun.  Probably my most active winter break.  I don't want to go to school... and Tuesday will be a day full of homework.  Maybe I'll get some homework done before tuesday?  Oh well, tomorrow is going to be fun.  New Years Eve at Megan's house.  I still remember going over to Megan's house for the very first time last year.  Time flies, and I'm really sorry Megan about that =P  

Well, I don't think I have anymore to say... I hope everyone has a great and safe New Years Eve.  Adios

I had parties in all of my classes except for APES.  I'm can't drink anymore soda, too much soda today.  In APES I had the quiz, a great way to end the day.  I felt really good after studying last night, but when I went to take the test, I guess my mind went blank.  I'm doubtful that I scored well on that quiz... I'm so pissed off at myself.  I took the longest to finish the test and I did a lot of studying.  I dunno, I was hoping to score higher on this quiz.  But I have to thank Mr Lawwill for helping me out with a few questions.  I've been trying to work harder and bring my grades up to where they're suppose to be this quarter, and its working for some classes and not for the others.  I feel like I'm failing in everything I'm doing.  I was really happy this week, having xmas coming up and everything.  Hopefully tomorrow will be a better day.  I'm really glad to be exchanging gifts tomorrow, that will get me into the holiday spirit.  I'm amazed on how fast everything is going.  And it really made me start thinking.  This year seems very different compared to last.  The group had a lot of fun at the beginning of this year, but it looks like things are goin downhill now.  We're probably not going to hang out as a whole group during the break.  And I was hoping to have fun and spend time with my friends.  Eh, I dunno.  Last year seemed better.  

Well the snowboarding trip got canceled because of the lack of snow.  The good new is that I get to spend time with the whole family on xmas day.  I really wanted to go somewhere during break, oh well.  My family is having a xmas party on Saturday.  It's going to be fun, I think Mike gets home tonight or tomorrow.  Yea, so I've been hyped up in getting a PS2, GTA3, and GT3 for my birthday.  My parents said that they would buy me everything if I got an acceptance letter before my birthday.  And if I didn't get one by my bday, they'll pay for half.  It sucks waiting... everyday I look in the mailbox just to see if anything came.  I guess I'll find out soon enough, I'll probably be nervous during that week of Jan 15th.  Yea, I learned that one of my cousins from Taiwan might move in with my family if she gets into Mason.  That should be interesting with a 5th member in the family.  Hopefully I'll be at tech or jmu 

Hmm... 

Well I can't remember what else I was going to write, I tend to do that a lot.  One more day, hopefully everything goes well tomorrow.  I'm going to have lots of fun giving everyone gifts.  I got my xmas done last night, felt good.  This is probably my first xmas that I really got involved in.  Just in case I don't update my journal next week, I hope everyone has a great break and holiday."

"event","Wow, I haven't wrote in a long time.  Its finally friday, this week was really long.  Just one more week until winter break.  It should be interesting, hopefully it goes by really fast.  I'm amazed how fast time is going.  It seems like just yesterday we were starting school.  Arg... what a week.  Well I'm going to study and try harder from now on.  Got a wake up call this week...  Good job to everyone who got their acceptance letters this week.  I wish I applied early for Tech.  I have to wait till Jan 15 to get my results from UMCP and JMU.  And I guess till April for my others.  It sucks waiting!  On the way back from the doctors, my dad told me that I got mail from tech.  I got freaked out, and knew it was either an acceptance letter or junk mail.  So we rushed home and it was just junk mail...

This weekend has started out pretty good.  Its going to be a busy one, but its a good break.  Went xmas shopping with Ed today.  We went to visit Danielle at work, and I played with the puppies.  I wish my parents would let me have a dog.  At 8, we went over to Meg's house.  It was fun, got to talk and hang out.  ""Great times, Great times.""  Get to go to work tomorrow morning.  Get my pay check then get a haircut.  Then finish up my xmas shopping and join the group at the mall.  We're bell ringing, it's going to be tight.  And I don't think I got anything planned afterwards, maybe racquetball.  But I got a lot of school work to do.  Gotta study for Psych and do that web.  And I definately have to watch the Eagles and Redskins game.  Sunday, I'm probably going to follow my routine and go to the gym.  

Don't want to do any work right now, I guess I'll just chill.  Burned the New Ludacris CD.  It's interesting... =D

I'm out..."

"event","Ahh today isn't a Friday?  The half day made today feel like a Friday, and it sucks that we still have 2 more days till the weekend.  And whats up with the weather?  Early December and its around 75?  It should be snowing!  Hmm well good thing I get to be at a place where theres snow during xmas.  Really excited that I'm going snowboarding at 7springs for 3 days.  Its going to be tight going with friends.  Wish my parents would come along, kinda sucks that I won't be spending Christmas Day with them.  Speaking of Xmas, I'm half way done with my xmas shopping.  Hopefully I'll finish by Saturday.  Friday is going to be fun.  I'm helping out at Santa's Workshop.  Last year was great, and I'm sure its going to be a lot of fun this year.  Just gotta live through school.  

Right now my house is a reck.  Theres parts of the walls and ceiling missing.  My parents are getting the water pipes changed.  Its weird, I gotta get through a plastic sheet separating the basement to my computer.

Well I just finished my love essay for Bednarz.  It actually took awhile to BS.  Now I gotta write my APES essay.  I've been putting it off for more than a week now.  Got an all right beginning, it needs work.  Arg the Comp Sci quiz sucked today, pissed me off.  The test wasn't actually that hard, but since it was a half day, there wasn't enough time to take the test.  I had around 5 questions blank when the bell rang.  The questions required some time and I didn't feel like stayin anything longer, so I just bubbled in answers.  I regret doing that, but there was nothing else I could do.  And in trig, Mrs B can't teach, nobody knows whats going on and I have a quiz on Friday.  For some reason my grades are disappointing... eh

Today was cool, after school a whole bunch of us went to Tonys for lunch.  After lunch I went to work, my bosses weren't in so I had a free day.  I went to get my sister's gift after work.  I'm really happy for Kristen and Eric for gettin their UVA acceptances.  Haha I still gotta wait... :-\  Hopefully I get an acceptance letter from tech, thats all that matters right now.  

Hmm must get further in APES essay... adios"

"event","Why has Livejournal been so shitty lately?  I can't even view my own livejournal, and they're constantly under maintanence.  Oh well...

Haha.. Today was enjoyable... 3 horrible tests.  Psych, Trig, and APES all on the same day.  I should've studied more last night, I wasn't too comfortable with half of the Psych and APES test.  When I got home I was freaking out about the trick questions that Mr. Lawwill had in his test.  And lucky me, I have the government test tomorrow.  This has been probably been one of the hardest weeks.  I'm kinda surprised how fast this week has gone by.  I guess it's smooth sailing after the gov test.  

Megan, Ed, and I went to see Justin's orchestra concert.  It was pretty cool, it was short and sweet.  The concert reminded me of the days I used to play the violin.  I realized that a lot of people are in orchestra, people I didn't know played the strings.  Theres a lot of talented people at Chantilly.  Before the concert we went to McDonalds for dinner and WalMart.  While at WalMart I got to play XBox.  XBox has huge controllers.  But I'll stick with my computer anyday.

Justin- UP TOP =P  Good Job: Elizabeth, Chris, Sheela and everybody else."

"event","<h2>Happy Thanksgiving!</h2>


Can't wait till tonight.  Lots of great food.  Going to spend Thanksgiving over at Mike's house.  I'm goin to bake brownies and make the stuffing.  It was really nice getting 10 hours of sleep.  Hmm I don't want to go to work tomorrow.  I want to spend my time at home, I got lots of work to do during the break.  And next week is going to be hell.  I have either a quiz or test or project due on each day.  Yesterday was fun, we went over to Trey's house after school.  Just chilled there, played a lot of 64.  At night, Ed, mike, alice, linda, and I went to play racquetball.  Haha we got our asses whipped by Uncle Allen.  We actually played a game with 5 players.  Ed and I had a good game playing against each other.  We never finished, we were stuck at the same points many times.  I still need to go pick up racquets and balls tomorrow.  Well I gotta go mow the lawn, wash the car, and play bball with mike.  Later

I hope everyone has a great Thanksgiving."

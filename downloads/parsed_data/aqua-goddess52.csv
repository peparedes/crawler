Would i still be me without swimming?  I LIKE swimming - just not 9 fricking times a week!  it's too much!  im not THAT dedicated... so quit swimming, or just cut down?  Or quit for a year then join in university?  Or quit, then take lifeguarding couses and TEACH swimming?  

All i know is i WANT to swim - maybe not 9 times a week, but i do - but with go?  For lifeguarding?  the plus about guarding is i get money for doing something i love...  and i NEED to get out of my house, hence i need money.  Then again - am i even gonna get INTO university?"

I really need to write more often.  It just, i forget i HAVEN'T because I write in my real journal, then I cant keep them straight.  Yes, I have a small brain.

Anyways, I against all odds, got a boyfriend!  Yes, one of my very own.  Those rabbit snares work wonders.  hehehe.  just kidding.  He is so sweet.  He left flowers in my locker, told me he loves me, is SO nice to me... only problem:  he's realyl shy in person.  on msn, he's great.  but he hasnt called me yet.  and in person we are just like... friends.  which is great.  but some physical contact would be nice.  whatever.  it will come in time."

Jess was creepy (in a good way, dont worry) today.  she wrote one of her awesome rant things about murder and such.  She has such a great creative writing style, with out even putting effort into it - i am so jealous.

Danielle and Melly both are smelly - ha! now it's on the internet so everyone knows.

Cameron - you think you're exotic, but really, you're just crap on toast.  and just because it's in quotations doesn't make it true.

Anywho... Danielle, Cameron,remember that time we toboggoned down the slide?  so fun - but painful to land on the wood.  ow.

One doesn't really count - she just follows the first one, and the third, well, he goes through stupid and non stupid phases.  who can figure out guys?

We dont really even talk that much off of msn, or notes because i am a better writer than i am in person - i get shy in person and writing is one of my few talents.  

I am really worried about my neighbour.  I have known her since we are three, and although we are really close, i have never really needed to be there for her before, but now yesterday she came over CRYINg like crazy, and i had to help her.  A guy at school is doing some really mean stuff to her.  Are there ANY problems that are not based on guys?

I have a band concert tonight, and our teacher is a freak.  He is planning all this ""funny, audience friendly"" stuff, which basically turns us into some sort of stupid circus.  I hate stuff that is there to make people laugh by making fun of other people.  

Anyways, next time i have time, i will post a whole bunch of me & Danielle's stupid stuff we do so i wont ever forget it, and whenever either of us are sad, we can come read it for a guarenteed laugh."

"event","Hmm...again long gap between postings. But I am bored. I have no car at the moment and, as they say on the television commercial, 'Life sucks without a car.' Quite true, quite true. Being stuck at home is miserable. I feel all shitty and blah like when I'm stuck here for very long, and am quite irritable to boot. But oh well I shall have a new car soon! Within the next week or two. Hooray.

Hm...but other than that I can't think of anything to post about. I feel kinda weird posting in this thing...almost arrogant to think people would want to read about my silly life. But hey it works. Well, today was all right. Got up, went to Denton to get the title registered in my name for my car I wrecked so that I can salvage it. But then after I got home, while I was napping, the auto place called and said that they need the title by Saturday. Uh oh. The lady at the tax office said it'd be a good 3-4 weeks before it arrives. No bueno. I'll have to sort out that lil' fishie tomorrow. After that I went to work this evening, didn't really accomplish anything other than getting some shit out of my freezer. Then after work Houston, Alex, and Brandon came to see me and they had a treat. Yay!! :) But now I'm going to bed I thinks cause i gotta be in Grapevine at like 7 and then back to Trophy Club after that. Long day ahead. Oh well...'tis something to do other than sit around this place."

"event","Well. Long time no update. Maybe I'll try to keep this thing updated more often. But tonight was fun. Met up with Holli at some club in Arlington. The intent was to see her old band perform but I got there too late and missed that one. But there was one band there that the lead singer had a lovely voice, although the music was drowning her out. After that fun lil' bit, we proceeded to Denny's where we met some friends of hers. I already forgot their names. Oh well I'm sure I'll run into them again. But one of them she said reminded her of me. And oddly enough, he kind of reminded me of me. If that makes sense. I don't know. Now I'm at home and I'm bored like crazy. And buh thinking about things that I'd really rather not be thinking about right now. But oh well. I'm out."

"event","Today was fun. It was Abby's birthday, my mother's birthday, and I found out yesterday was Karen's birthday soo yeah. Well after school I went along with my family to a restaraunt because we were taking my mother out to eat. Then after that, I went to see Abby and give her some cheescake and stuff. While I was up there seeing Abby, I found out it was Karen's birthday yesterday. So I headed up to Grapevine because I still had to get my mother's birthday present and to get Karen something as well. So about 9:30 I end up back at Tom Thumb to give Karen what I got her and invite everyone out to Chili's after work (my treat of course). Abby, Bethany, Alex, and Jordan were supposed to come, but neither Jordan nor Alex ever showed. Heh...seems any time me or Abby plan to have a meal with several people, several people don't show. Oh well, it was fun anyways. Our 2 waiters were Justin and Trey. Justin was most definitely flirting with Abby and even made our ticket cheap. Of course I tipped him very well and Abby's got some pics if you wanna check them out <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/trophy_girl/2723.html#cutid1"">here.</a> And after that, I am where I am now. Sitting at home full as hell, feeling horribly fat, but it was a really great day and it wasn't even my birthday! Oh and February 16 we're going to do it again for Bethany's birthday!"

"event","Haha yay thanks to Lindsay I can post again! She told me bout the handy lil' privacy feature that allows me to limit journal viewing to friends only. So that's neat.

Today was the same ol' day. I snuck out of 4th block today like 20 minutes early or so. I was so bored i just couldn't wait 20 minutes for the damn bell to dismiss. Ugh I really should do my english homework and stuff but oh well. I was supposed to do some computer training for working in the pharmacy department today but they didn't have it set up or something so I just spent my time doing the normal other stuff today. Then the normal GM stuff yup yup. Well now I'm sitting here upon my ass awaiting doing nothing. 'Tis fun. Well, that's all for now."

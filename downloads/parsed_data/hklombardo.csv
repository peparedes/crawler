I know I'm not but I seriously knew NOTHING on that exam.&nbsp; Guessed I did.&nbsp; Crap! Last night I was totally justifying not studying cause it's pointless and a waste of time cause you learn it for like a second and then you forget everything immediately after you take the test.&nbsp; What's the point ya know? That point will be biting me in the ass when I can't graduate cause I didn't pass Music History.&nbsp; </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>PS I took some excedrin w/ caffenine and I'm shaking like a mo-fo right now.&nbsp; It's pretty cool.&nbsp; Gotta run to class again...</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>oh yes, and this whole not having a car thing sucks! SUCKS I say.&nbsp; I seriously don't know how I'm getting home tonight and I just love relying on other people to do things for me...mmmmmmmmm. </STRONG></P>

"event","<P><STRONG>So, I had the best voice lesson today that I've ever had this entire year. That makes me very excited.&nbsp; Things are starting to go well in the voice-realm.&nbsp; I'm just glad I had a very productive, focused lesson!:) Anyway, that's how I started my day.&nbsp; Then I had a few classes, a really boring recital to watch and now I'm here...sitting in the library, trying to waste time before choir. Then guess what I'm doing...come on...getttt it. I'm GOING HOME!:) I *heart* home...well mainly the people in my home(town).</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>&nbsp;So I'm bored now. I just want to go--I hate having to wait around&nbsp; for hours to do ONE thing for like an hour. It's pointless if you ask me. And to top off the boredom I've got major pains going on in my back/stomach (early signs of the good ol' '.' I'm sure) and it sucks....I'm not gonna lie.&nbsp; </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Talked to Dan last night. Apparently we talk everyday now. It's the weirdest non-bf/gf relationship I've had w/ him.&nbsp; But it's nice to have him there to talk to and such...unless he's being an ass which happens quite often I might add.&nbsp; Kady says we are all the signs of dating w/o the fun stuff.&nbsp; Cool. I get the shitty part of a relationship and non of the goods (and you know that's all I want). Whatever, I'm just glad we're in a place where we're cool w/ eachother and can really talk to eachother.&nbsp; </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Welp, that's about it over here. I'm so excited to relax this weekend. I can't wait til I'm home for the summer, I just don't like it here...except for the fact that my bestests friends will be no where in sight:( Makes me sad, but I'm so happy for them and all the cool things they'll be doing.&nbsp; :):)</STRONG></P>"

"event","<P>Wow, I haven't written in this thing in forever! I'm pretty sure I can't reiterate all the events that have happened in my life..but if you're reading this you already know them anyways, so I'll spare you the details. </P>
<P>Today was a good day. It's rainy so that sucks and I'm totally unmotivated, but whatever.&nbsp; I had to get some shit figured out for summer school. They did something wrong of course and so I had to fix it.&nbsp; And now I can't take Spanish 1 in Morris like I had originally thought...oh well. I just need to get it over w/. I can't wait to be done w/ school!!</P>
<P>Oh my I'm so excited about going to MEXICO!!:):) I'm happy that I decided to go, even though I can't afford it at all---I know it will be worth it. Just to be w/ my girls and relax! AHHHHHHHHH Plus my sister is the coolest ever and let me put it on her low interest rate credit card:)</P>
<P>I have a crush on a 19 year old. Yeah, so. He's cute, and I'm sure he's inexperienced which just makes it way more fun.&nbsp; His name is Guy(what's the deal w/ me and guys that have weird names...I guess I have a weird name too) He's a freshman and we take voice from the same teacher, so we have vocal lab together and such.&nbsp; We actually talked about sex today. It was funny cause he was taken out of sex ed just like me!! Only his parents taught it to him instead. That's way more funny than just getting taken out of the class. So we laughed about that today---and I told him how I learned what sex was...at Bible camp. Good times</P>
<P>So yeah, that's about it on interesting things for the day.&nbsp; I need to start up writing in this thing again, I like it:)</P>"

"event","<P><STRONG>I do not recommend waking up at 4am.&nbsp; It sucks.&nbsp; We sang at the Minnesota Prayer Breakfast this morning, and it was cool to be apart of but it sucked having to be at school by 5am....not gonna lie.&nbsp; So I took a nap this evening when I finally got home from school, then my stupid obnoxious roomate came in my room and woke me up just to ask me to tap survivor for her! Ah! I was so pissed. I didn't answer the door so that should have been clue #1 that I didn't want to be bothered.&nbsp; But no, she just comes right in and starts talking.&nbsp; I'm thinking to myself, this can't actually be happening right now. I'm in bed w/ my eyes closed yet she's still talking. Oh my I hate living w/ idiots.&nbsp; </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Anyways, most of my day I was in a coma so I don't really remember what all went on. I went to all my classes though so that was impressive.&nbsp; Then I was super nervous I was gonna have to sit around school all day tomorrow for a ten minute run through of our opera scene, but fortunately I got out of it so I'm hitting the road early tomorrow and getting home at a decent hour!! I can't wait!!:):) I need the break desperately.&nbsp; I was talking to Tiff and Kris earlier and everyone is stressing over school and what not.&nbsp; Why is there so much to do?!?! That's what I want to know.&nbsp; I'm just burnt out from school and I can't wait to be done! Speaking of being done, mom and dad are behind my major change 100%!! Oh that was a relief.&nbsp; I don't give them enough credit.&nbsp; And plus I always go to them w/ questions or concerns about my life so it's partly my fault cause I rely on them so much and they are just trying to be supportive. Then I take that the wrong way.&nbsp; I guess after the moody thing I have this huge complex about f*ing everything up again and getting my parents pissed at me again.&nbsp; But I shouldn't worry about that cause that isn't gonna happen again AND changing my major really isn't that big of a deal.&nbsp; But it is so nice to hear my mom say ""you've been in school for a long time etc etc and it will be nice to just be done and get going on what you want to do"" aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>So I'm headed home for the long Easter weekend and I hope I come back w/ some fun happy stories next week.&nbsp; Then it's the opera and Kady and Kris coming to see it and ME!! WEEEEEEEEEEKIES!! I'm so excited for them to come here!!:):)</STRONG></P>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#6600cc size=2>So I don't know how to change the font size on this thing, so my last entry is like size 32 font.&nbsp; cool.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc size=2>Today is off to a good start.&nbsp; I'm feeling productive so that's good. Maybe I'll actually get some things done before I get to go home!!! I hope so cause I hate going home and thinking about all the things I still need to do when I get back to school. It would be nice to get at least some of it out of the way beforehand. I'm just so excited about coming home. It seems like forever since I've been there. But I guess it's only been a couple months, if that even.&nbsp; So I got up a bit earlier today so I could go and practice w/ my wonderful accompanist.&nbsp; I love her.&nbsp; Plus she's like the best piano player ever, which is helpful.&nbsp; Just got done taking a Music Theory IV test.&nbsp; That was great.&nbsp; Should have studied, oh yeah I should've.&nbsp; OH well.&nbsp; I got done early too so I have some time before my next class to do some homework and write in here and email and such.&nbsp; So that is making me quite happy.&nbsp; I'm just so excited for Thursday to come I can hardly stand it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc size=2>For some reason I'm super nervous about telling my parents that I changed my major. I feel like I felt when I had to tell them the Moody thing...and that's like 47392847239801 times worse.&nbsp; Who am I? I don't know why I'm working myself up sooooooo much over something so small.&nbsp; I'm sure it will be fine. I think I'll tell them today. I just have to get it over with and explain to them how much happier I am already.&nbsp; They'll be cool w/ it I'm sure.&nbsp; Plus, if I don't tell them soon my blood pressure is just gonna sky-rocket until I have a mild heart attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc size=2>Talked to G this weekend, which was wonderful.&nbsp; I called him and left a message and he called back--which I was&nbsp;glad about, because of course as soon as&nbsp;I hang&nbsp;up from&nbsp;leaving him a message my mind starts going crazy wondering if he just didn't answer cause he hates me&nbsp;etc etc you know Todd.&nbsp; So when he called back it was a relief in a way.&nbsp; We had a really good convo.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was flowing and no weird pauses, and we were joking w/ each other and such..then he had a bad connection so he said he'd&nbsp;call&nbsp;back.. when he did though it was like we were out&nbsp;of things to talk about&nbsp;so there were the weird&nbsp;awkward pauses and things.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hate that. I almost wished we would have just ended the first&nbsp;convo&nbsp;and talked later, but oh well I mean it wasn't that&nbsp;bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;during one of our awkward pauses, I practically screamed I was coming home. Good one, Hope.&nbsp; He asked when and why and I told him and then he's like, ""Keep me in mind"" What the hell does that mean? I don't know.&nbsp;So&nbsp;I said, ""keep&nbsp;ME in mind"" idiot (didn't call him an idiot but i wanted to) So&nbsp;I guess I'll have to see what goes&nbsp;down this weekend, if anything.&nbsp; I'm not that worried about it----yet.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc size=2>So I should go and get some work done before 3 more classes.&nbsp; PS friends....we are ALL going out on Thursday,&nbsp; Friday, and Sat.&nbsp; and&nbsp;Sunday night if you want to...I miss you all and we have a lot to catch up on...I haven't made out w/ you guys for a&nbsp;very very long time!!!!&nbsp; </FONT></P>"

"event","<P><FONT size=5>I feel like lately I've just been going through the motions. No feeling.&nbsp; No thoughts. Nothing.&nbsp; It's weird really.. I mean I have thoughts and feelings on some things, obviously.&nbsp; But lately-school has just been one big blur. I have no idea what is going on. I'm here, I go to class, I do my work--but it all seems surreal or something. It's weird and I have no idea what is going on in my head right now.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that is just on more reason to add to my list of why I need to be done w/ school soon.&nbsp; And when I say soon, I mean now. But really, I only have about 8 months of actually school left-counting summer school and such.&nbsp; Not that bad when I think about it. Plus I'll be away from here for the entire summer anyways-so that's good.&nbsp; I need a break from Minnesota. Oh yeah I do.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=5>So I got the music that I'll be singing for my friend Alanna's wedding this summer.&nbsp; It's the most beautiful song ever.&nbsp; It's called Laudate Dominum by Mozart, and really it's beautiful.&nbsp; I hope I can sing it. So I'm getting excited for that. She's getting married July 8th though and that's the day before my bday so I'll probably be driving home on my bday-fun stuff.&nbsp; Oh well. Let's see what else have I done today?&nbsp; Got up and had a voice lesson from 9:30-10:30 which was ok.&nbsp; Met some friends for coffee-class from 11:25-1:10pm-lunch and now I'm sitting in the library. Then I have choir from 4:30-5:45pm then opera practice tonight.&nbsp; Aren't you glad I told you all that? That's what I thought. I should probably go and practice actually.&nbsp; I really need to do that. Really.</FONT>&nbsp; I am just one big ball of nothingness today.&nbsp; </P>
<P>For some reason, I have not been able to sleep.&nbsp; Usually I'm in bed at 9ish and asleep by 10.&nbsp; I know I'm old..&nbsp; But for some reason, since I got home from Seattle I haven't been able to even get into bed before 12am. It's weird for me.&nbsp; Maybe a good thing though. I may have been getting too much sleep there for awhile(10-12hrs)&nbsp; I think 7-8hours is enough. I like staying up though. It's fun to just be doing stuff when everyone else is sleeping.&nbsp; And plus that way I'm not bothered by my roommates.&nbsp; AND this way maybe I can actually talk to my friends who are normal and don't go to sleep at 9pm.&nbsp; :) This whole not sleeping thing is looking up.&nbsp; </P>
<P>ps I've been freaking out about something lately and I need some positive reinforcement on the subject.&nbsp; It's one of those things that I freak out about all the time, but this time it's weird so if you want to know or think you already know or have some words of encouragement please feel free .........</P>"

I think I'll tell mom and dad tomorrow that I changed my major.&nbsp; Hope they are ok w/ it.&nbsp; I know they will be--but still I'm nervous.&nbsp; Anyways, just got back from Seattle.&nbsp; It was soo beautiful there---didn't rain one day. It was awesome. Choir tour was good and the wedding went great.&nbsp; I'm happy for Joe and Melissa and it was so much fun to hang out w/ my family:):)&nbsp; So that was that.&nbsp; I sang at the wedding too, and that went alright---this man said my voice was enchanting...that was very nice of him.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I'm excited to go home for Easter.&nbsp; I can't wait for an actual break and to hang out at home.&nbsp; Maybe I'll see G? Who knows. I will probably be a little upset if I don't see him, but either way if it's meant to be it will happen and I can't be upset about something that I never had--so I'm cool for now.&nbsp; I'm trying to stay sane, and I think I'm doing a very good job about it....right? He called twice this past weekend and it was&nbsp; nice to talk to him since it had been a few weeks.&nbsp; His grandpa died a few weeks ago and I felt really bad for him.&nbsp; I think it's the grandpa that he would go and just sit with every once in a while...how sweet is that?&nbsp; But I feel bad that he died--- young or old--it's just sad.&nbsp; I'll probably give him a call at the end of the weekend or beginning of next week and work into the convo that I'm coming home and see what he does w/ the information.&nbsp; we'll seeeeeeee</STRONG></P>

"event","<P><STRONG><FONT color=#00cccc size=4>Gross. I hate being sick.&nbsp; Seriously, am I always sick? This sucks.&nbsp; I leave for tour on Thursday and I'm super excited about going to Seattle, but I think I would be even more excited if I could go home for a week and then go to Seattle for the wedding. That would be wonderful. I just need a break and I'm not gonna get one on this tour...plus I'm sick so that adds to the stressfulness of the trip.&nbsp; But whatever, I can't do anything about it now...already paid the $450 for the tour so it's not like I can just say I'm not gonna go.&nbsp; Today was gonna be a busy day until I skipped everything and went shopping instead.&nbsp; What? I needed the break badly and I'm just stressing out way tooooooo much.&nbsp; So I skipped some stuff and went to some stuff. Plus, I'm sick so I have an excuse:)&nbsp; Speaking of being sick, I went to the doctor yesturday and of course I just have some stupid viral infection--like usual--so I can't do anything about it...All I wanted were some drugs! But it was cute cause the doc wrote me a note to get out of school. lol. And I'm in 7th grade again. But I am glad I don't have anything too serious, cause seriously, I thought I was getting Mono again (which would be awesome cause then maybe I could lose like 15lbs in a week like last time) but apparently I have no such thing. Except my glands are the size of golf balls. I would have you feel them if you were here...oh yeah I would.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#00cccc size=4>Oh! Good news. I passed my Sight singing exam today!! Woohoo for me!!:):) I thought for sure I was gonna fail.&nbsp; We had to sing 20 intervals up and down--and we can only get like 4 wrong or something and if we don't pass we have to keep taking it until we do or else we don't pass the class...but I did it so that's one thing I can cross off my list! Oh I'm just so happy about that. I was seriously freaking out there for a second.&nbsp; It was funny, cause I had one interval left and I HAD to get it right cause I had already used up my 4 wrongs and I was having a small panic attack cause there was a LOT riding on this last interval. Talk about pressure.&nbsp; And I really really really didn't want to have to retake the entire thing cause I missed it by one point.&nbsp; Who wants to do that?! but I got it right and all was well in the world.&nbsp; So now I'm relieved:)</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#00cccc size=4>Talked to Kady about the fact that G hasn't called and it's been longer than usual.&nbsp; But she said that talking every once in a while was a way to keep in touch--not to start a relationship.&nbsp; And that's totally true.&nbsp; But it is cool to talk w/ him every couple weeks or so --so that if we did want to hang out when I'm actually in the state, we could cause we've kept in touch. I'm trying not to be too psycho on this subject.&nbsp; Whatever, it's really not that big of a deal--I just like talking about it out loud to make sure all is right in my head, so I don't go crazy. You know, todd.&nbsp; And I think all is right in my head, I'm really not stressing over it---I have too much other crap to think about right now.&nbsp; I can MAYBE stress over the summer, but then again I'll be in school over the summer too so I just may not have time for it! Which is a very good thing:) </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#00cccc size=4>What should I do w/ my hour I have until choir starts? Hmmmm.&nbsp; Maybe I will do some research on my repertoire.&nbsp; Yes, I will do that.&nbsp; And I'm calm all of the sudden. Not that I'm complaining or anything...It's very good to be calm.&nbsp; This way I won't have a heartattack when I'm 30.&nbsp; Good times.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#00cccc size=4>ps I just found out that Steph's brother died yesturday and it's just the saddest thing ever.&nbsp; I feel so bad for her and her fam.&nbsp; I don't even know what to say. I was really shook up about it yesturday..I guess just cause it reminded me of Jesse and death and how you never know when it's gonna happen to you or someone you love deeply. And it can all happen in an instant.&nbsp; Geez it just sucks and it's so hard to understand.&nbsp; I know that Steph wasn't that close to her brother but still--it's her brother.&nbsp; I just can't even imagine.&nbsp; Seriously, I have no words.&nbsp; I know God works all things for a reason, and I hate it when people say that when someone is going through a hard time, cause it just seems like a cop-out cause you have nothing better to say to the person.&nbsp; but at the same time, I know it's true.&nbsp; I guess if I could understand everything that God did, then He wouldn't be God now would He? </FONT></STRONG></P>"

Oh that sounds like fun.&nbsp; Then I have to go to Caribou or somewhere to try and get my written homework done (cause if I try to do it here I won't) And then I have to go to the library and research crap and practice.&nbsp; I just know I'll feel much better if I just get all this crap done today, then I can chill tomorrow and such.&nbsp; </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>oh, so Micah called me last night.&nbsp; That was odd for me.&nbsp; It's so funny cause he's such a shy quiet guy but lately when I see him at school he's all outgoing and touchy.&nbsp; It's weird I'm not gonna lie.&nbsp; But cool, I'd rather have him be like that instead of being a complete dud.&nbsp; Anyways, he called and asked if I wanted to go running.&nbsp; I'm all like Right now?! But I think he meant later cause then he said on Monday (good thinking Hope...idiot) Cause we have talked about working out together since I've never laid foot in the work out place and he has.&nbsp; Anyways, point of that story is that I'm gonna go and work out w/ him on Monday and I'm nervous cause I'm so out of shape it's not even funny.&nbsp; And point #2 of that story is that it's weird that he actually called...cool, cause I like being his friend- just caught me by suprize is all.&nbsp; </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Seriously, could my roommate be in the bathroom any longer?!</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Anyways--ooo she's out of the bathroom! I need to shower so I can get going on my day.&nbsp; I was gonna mention something else tho....OoH yes, Daniel.&nbsp; Called him last night cause we're cool like that (which took a while to get to but finally we're there) and I wanted to tell him about my change of major decision and he just dove straight into all his 'problems' and such...and me being a good friend listened and offered advice.&nbsp; Then I was like can I tell you something about me...and he's all like ""if it will make you happy"" .&nbsp; That little f-ing bitch--so I let him go cause I'd had just about enough.&nbsp; So then I called him back and he didn't answer (I didn't think he would) and left him a nice little message explaining how sometimes I call him to talk to him about something about me and he never cares to ask about me or what's going on w/ me---it's just constantly his shit and it's pissing me off.&nbsp; So we'll have to see how he responds to that.&nbsp; He probably won't because it would mean he'd have to talk about something other than himself! And I'm pissed again.&nbsp; Whatever. It'll be cool I'm sure.&nbsp; </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Anyways, I'm gonna hit it now.&nbsp; And when I say hit it I mean take a shower...</STRONG></P>"

OH my I'M FINALLY GRADUATING!!!:):):) Then I'll have to get my Spanish classes approved before I sign up for good ol' summer school.&nbsp; But I'm sure everything is going to work out or at least I really really hope so...Well I know it will cause this is what I really really really want and I've already talked to like EVERYONE possible and it is all in order.. But it will be officially in order by Wed.!:) Speaking of telling everyone about my life decisions, I talked to my opera coach today and told her about my change of major and she was all like ""Good, I think that's a really good idea."" And I'm all like ""where were you when I was struggling w/ this stupid decision before:?!?!"" and she said that now my major is broader and I can do more things with it, plus it takes the pressure off...aaaaand she said that&nbsp;parents really don't know what they're talking about.&nbsp; Makes me feel sooo much better about stuff and validates the fact that I'm right and I know what is best for me and my life.&nbsp; And it is MY decision:)&nbsp; I know it sounds like I'm totally bashing my parents, and I'm not...I know they will support me now matter what I decide, they've even said it before.&nbsp; It's just being a pastor's kid, I have this paranoia that I won't live up to my parents excpectations and they will be disappointed...Oh wait, I already did that--it's called Moody.&nbsp; But they dealt w/ that and plus I don't think I can screw up as much as I did back then, so I think I'm cool.</STRONG></FONT></P>

She asked if I had been talking about changing my major. And I got all nervous and said yes. But we have talked about it so much that she knew about my thoughts on the subject, so it wasn't that bad.&nbsp; She said she just wanted to see me happy:) And I told her all the things I've been thinking about and she said it sounded like I was making progress, and that I should leave my parents out of it completley.&nbsp; Then we pretty much decided I was gonna change my major. It was fun.&nbsp; Well she said it sounded like I've pretty much made up my mind and I should just do it.&nbsp; I think I'm going to people.. Can you believe it?!?! I'm making my own decision about my own life, and I'm not even feeling bad about it.&nbsp; Ah, relief.&nbsp; So yes, we had our chitchat that made me feel wonderful cause she was on my side and thought it was a beneficial decision.&nbsp; Then I had choir.&nbsp; Then I had about an hour break before this concerto/aria competition I had to go to....That started at 7pm and I left early and still didn't get home til just now--and it's 10ish.&nbsp; Longest thing ever.&nbsp; But it was good.&nbsp; </FONT></P>

So&nbsp;I just got back into town, from visiting good ol'&nbsp;Morris/ISU this weekend. Longest drive EVER.&nbsp; I decided to leave today instead of last night, just cause I hate driving on Sundays and the weather&nbsp;sucked.&nbsp; So I left&nbsp;around 7am and the weather sucked even more. I hate driving - let alone in rain/sleet/snow. All in all, the drive sucked and I hated it.&nbsp; There you have it.&nbsp; But my weekend was&nbsp;fun.&nbsp;Saw my nephew! OH my, he is the cutest thing I've ever seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then went down to ISU w/ my girls (kady, tiff and david)..it was super.&nbsp; We saw the Vagina Monlogues (good show ps) and went out.&nbsp; We've decided David is officially a woman.&nbsp; And I'm laughing out loud just thinking about it.&nbsp; (Someone just asked me what I was laughing about too...hard to explain to one of these people) But yes, David is officially a woman.</FONT>&nbsp; </FONT><FONT size=1>I'll spare the details but it still makes me laugh.</FONT></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT color=#c0c0c0 size=1><STRONG>So I've been thinking about the G thing&nbsp; a little more...ok a lot more..What? So I think about him! SO!

Sorry, I do. I hate wasting my time wondering if he will call and then after he does call, wondering what it meant and analyzing ever last word we said to each other. It's tiring.&nbsp; Plus, we're so far apart, I don't need all this added stress if he just wants to be friends- is this making sense??? I just feel like why not just be straight up-no games (which, come to think of it, I've said to him before). I don't know if I'll ever get the balls to ask/say what I'm actually thinking, but I have a feeling that no matter how he responds to it (be it he just wants to be friends or whatever) I'll feel better knowing everything and not wondering and going CRAZY over it!

Oh yes, and I saw a friend of mine that just graduated from here in December.&nbsp; She was a vocal performance major too (wonderful voice ps) and we're the same age...finally someone my age!! Anyways, she asked me how everything was going w/ singing and crap and I told her I was thinking about changing my major and she was sooo cool about it.&nbsp; I figured she was gonna be like every other voice major and say to just stick w/ it blah blah blah.&nbsp; But she didn't and said I would get good experience in other areas that would be beneficial for me anyways.&nbsp; Seriously I feel like I'm not even making sense anymore? Did I just make sense? Cause I can't tell.&nbsp; I'm so tired.&nbsp; Well point of that story was that she was cool w/ me changing my major and that makes me feel better about it.&nbsp; I'm gonna go...</STRONG></FONT></P>"

So there's your music history lesson for the day:)</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I was so incredibly busy today. Or at least it felt that way.&nbsp; Didn't sleep well at all last night-&nbsp; Had a sucky dream about boys.&nbsp; But that's neither here nor there.&nbsp; So anyways, I had 2 tests today.&nbsp; One in Music Theory-which I thought for sure I would flunk and it would be terrible and ruin my day-but it actually went really really well and I somewhat knew what I was talking about.&nbsp; So that was a plus.&nbsp; Then I had a test in Advanced Choral Conducting (why, you ask, do I have to take this class considering I'm NEVER going to conduct? Good question) which went well, but I was pissed cause I forgot a few things.&nbsp; OH well, what can I do about it now? Then for Music History, part of our exam was due today--the essay part, which I actually finished last night- so that was a plus.&nbsp; Then I skipped my last class (Opera Workshop) cause I'm tired, and the kids in there are unbelievably annoying--I just don't think I could handle that right now.&nbsp; So I just finished pilates (look at me:) and now I'm gonna run errands and tan.&nbsp; AAHH, tan.&nbsp; And there's my life for the day.</STRONG></P>

Wonderful. And yet another reason why I want to just be done w/ school.&nbsp; I have no energy to do any of it.&nbsp; I just want to be done!!</P>
<P>I went tanning today, and I seriously forgot just how wonderful and relaxing it is. So although it costs me a buttload to get, I'm excited to have some time to relax --Speaking of tanning, I have exactly 33 days until the wedding.&nbsp; My dress ($200 dress mind you) is being shipped to my house and I really hope it fits--but if it doesn't then that will really be an incentive to drop some LBS.&nbsp;I'm excited to see the dress though, it sounds super duper pretttttttty. </P>
<P>So I was talking to Kady about 20 mins. ago and she reminded me that this weekend is ALREADY the weekend before V-day--which means that Tiffy's Vagina monologue thingy is THIS weekend. Seriously, where did this month go?? It's already the middle of the month! Thank God, I""m soooo excited for this year to just be done w/.&nbsp; So yeah, I'm trying to decide if I should just drive down to ISU or something cause I really really want to, but I don't know what all I have to do w/ school crap and driving takes about one million years.&nbsp; I don't know, I'll think about it.&nbsp; Who knows maybe Tiff doesn't want me to come anyways (that better not be true!!!!)&nbsp; Time for the homework to begin...actually I think I'll do pilates first.&nbsp; That sounds more exciting than French Diction.</P>

I thought I was getting over the Adam thing and that I really didn't like him anymore.&nbsp; This is true, I guess I just don't like the idea of him being w/ someone else. :) What??! We all think that.&nbsp; I guess that's all I have to say about that.&nbsp; And don't worry, I already put my head down for friday night~!

"event","So here I sit, in the library at school.  Maybe the one place in Minnesota I can actually be by myself and do what I want to do w/o getting questions from everyone...geez.  And now I'm annoyed.  Example: Today I was in my room (which I share unfortunately) by myself chillin' for the .2 seconds of a break that I have today when my roommate walks in.  Then I have a phone call so I'm talking on the phone right? right...so my roommate decides this is the best time for her to take a nap--and then tells me that she is-which means she wants me to leave the room so she can sleep.  Let me remind you that I was in the room first, but whatever.  OH yes, and I really don't get good reception down-downstairs, and our other roommmate has the flu and is getting all her germs all over the couch.  Wonderful. Oh to live alone or to at least have my own room!!! So yeah, not to excited about that one today.  
In other news, I'm thinking SERIOUSLY about changing my major.  I've had these thoughts pretty much since the first day I started here at good ol' Northwestern, and it's time I make a decision for MYSELF instead of trying to please everyone else (parents).  I would change my major just to general music.  Pros: 1)d be done w/ school next FALL instead of a YEAR from next fall. OH yeah that's what I""m talking about. 2)I still am taking a lot of classes that are furthering my education and that aren't neccessarily required for this degree, so I'd be ahead of the game that way, and if I ever wanted to go back to school and get my Vocal performance degree, it wouldn't take all that long. 3)I'd still be licensed to teach privately which is all I really want to do anyways, besides perform--which leads to point 4)NO ONE cares what my degree is, as long as I HAVE one..plus in the performance world, people just want someone who can sing, not neccessarily if you have a degree or not. 5) I HATE my classes, I don't understand my classes and it stressed me out beyond belief.  And I really don't want to end up hating music because of my experience w/ it now. THe only think I honestly like is opera workshop and my voice lesson, and those are starting to run thin too...  6)I Honestly feel like my time here in Minnesota is up.  I really feel like staying here is keeping me from moving on with my life.  I can't start a career, I'm obviously not meeting anyone new and special- the friendships are minimal and not important. And my whole life is at least 7 hours away from me(real friends, family, church, etc) So yeah those are the PROS ...what do you think? I'm sure I could think of a few Cons-but I really don't think they are valid.  I mean I feel like I should just do what I WANT TO DO, and if I have a problem with it later in life, I have no one to resent .....plus I can always go back.  WE'll see how this goes, but I'm pretty sure I'm gonna do it...It's what I want and I'm sorry if my parents have issues with it...they'll get over it. They got over the Moody thing -- and this is sooooooo not as big as that.  Plus, they said they'd support me whatever I decided to do (as you can see I've been thinking about this for quite sometime) Geez, I'd just feel like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders if I did this... And it would be ALL MY DECISION:):)"

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000099>Went home to Morris this weekend.&nbsp; It was fun to see Kady, Tiff, Kris and David again.&nbsp; I miss my friends:( I just wish they lived here or I lived closer.&nbsp; Seriously I don't know how I live w/o them while I'm here...Got to chill w/ the fam too which was great.&nbsp; My parents are going to India soon so I wanted to see them before they left.&nbsp; It makes me nervous but I'm sure they'll be ok and have a great time etc etc.&nbsp; I woke up this morning (5am ps) and I was super depressed about leaving ..which is normal for me..and about other things.&nbsp; Stupid things that probably don't need to be mentioned, even though it takes up the better part of my thoughts during the day.&nbsp; I'm so stupid, let's just put it that way.&nbsp; </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000099>I don't want to leave my first journal entry on a bad note so I have to think of something else --hmmm, ooo 2 of my classes were cancelled today! How wonderful is that? So I got to take a nap and chill.&nbsp; It was wonderful--I love alone time:)</FONT></STRONG></P>"

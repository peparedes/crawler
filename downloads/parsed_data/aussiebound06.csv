"event","We had a fire drill last night.  I love how the fire doors close... I mean, you'd think they'd open so you could get out faster.  I know they close to contain the fire, but it's retarded, but oh well.  I gave a group tour today with Brad, and that worked well, except I went to bed at like 3, and got called into work at 9am :(  Oh well!  Gonna clean the room :)"

"event","<b>Wow... what a Survivor premiere.  First, there were 20 people, and they were basically stranded on an island, not knowing where they were.  Then, the first two Survivors, one male and one female to reach the shore won Immunity.  But, it was just a twist.  Jeff came on the island the second day, stating that the two Immunity holders were to pick the new tribes.  They each did a school yard pick, and the last two people to be picked WENT HOME!  Once forming tribes: Ulong and Koror.  The tribe lost the challenge voting out Jolanda in a 6-3 vote.

<i>This quote has been my inspiration for me living in Vermont.  I've decided I'm homesick...</i>
<br>
<br>
It's definitely been a long 6-weeks since I've seen everyone.  I miss 6Krew and Ally/Paul, Christian, Dave, and others.
<br>
<br>
How's Vermont?  That's the question everyone asks.  Is there a ton of snow?  Well, today there is, we're getting about 10-20 more inches on top of the 20 we already have.
<br>
<br>
I hate Vermont this month.  I'm having a hard time trusting people.  People who I've considered friends, are now acting weird around me, so something's up.  It's like High School all over again.  Welcome to Camp Champ.  People here are (and I don't mean everyone, cause there are some awesome people here, and I love it here), so immature sometimes, and I feel like everyone treats people like shit sometimes.
<br>
<br>
My classes this semester are tough.  They're easy concepts but my teachers are rough.  I will say that this is my favorite semester, class wise.  I feel that I'm being challenged for the first time, which is awesome.  I'm applying to be an RA, which is a ton of work, and between the drama in the dorm, Tour Guide, and classes, I'm booked up.  I've joined getREAL, the community service group, which is an awesome group of kids, and was nominated for the Community Book Program, which I'm putting flyers out for and such.
<br>
<br>
Christian is coming up next Thursday, which should be cool.  We're going snowboarding at Bolton Valley Resort on Saturday, and he'll get a taste of college life.  I promise, Deirdre, I won't corrupt him... I won't get him drunk, and high, and tripped out, and wasted at an all-night kegger with hookers and the like.  Ahh, I love Burlington sometimes.. Anyway, I'll be good."

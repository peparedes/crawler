Sooo then I looked up one time from my cellphone and saw this guy running across the parking lot. I was like...why is he running...? Then I thought, OH. He's stealing something. My sister saw it too, so we just stared at him run across the parking lot with a shoe box while this lady that worked at rack room chased him. I called my mom and was like, ""did someone just come running out of rack room?"" and she said, ""DID YOU SEE HIM?!!?!?!"" and i said, "".....yeah."" SO, she made me come talk to the police and give them a description of the burglar. It was fun, ROFL. I felt so stupid though, just standing there talking to this random police officer about a man who just ran across the parking lot with shoes. -_-' </p>"

So. Life. Nothing new, nothing slightly exciting...I went off to the mall and ran around and bought stuff. I got a cookie...which I'm not supposed to eat in bed, because I will choke on it and die. XD

How's everyone's summer? I hope you all are good,&nbsp; I miss ya! We should all get together sometime. Come to the Y! Or something, idk. It's the only thing to do here in the summer. I'm excited! We're getting our pool put in finally, and I'm gonna have my birthday here I think! YAY! I need to get everyone's addresses and stuff 'cause I have NO ONES. Somehow I'll get them...sooo....yeah.

.....

The Fuhrer killed his son and the Fuhrer stabbed Roy a couple of times then Al sacrificed himself for his brother and i guess Dante got eaten by Gluttony (YAY!) and then Roy came out of the Estate (the Fuhrer got killed by Roy WOOP Roy: King Bradley, how many times must I kill you...before you die) with  the Fuhrer's dead son and then that #$%^&*@#$%^& Terminarcher came and Riza Hawkeye came up behind Robo-Archer and shot him like 10 times WOO and I think the bullet passed through Archer and hit Roy or Archer shot Roy in the eye before Riza got up there to shoot him. Then Envy the crossdresser went through the Gate thing and turned into a dragon thing (what the freak happened there....?) and was lost forever and Ed was there and he cried for Al. So then the now alive Ed who was resurrected by Al was back to normal and Al was gone. And so Edward woke up crying with Rose in his face saying how Al sacrificed himself. So then Ed gave himself up for Al.

*commercial break*

*takes deep breath*

And then so Al ends up as his old self- a ten year old boy with no memories of his past. And it shows a bookwork named Sheska who works in the military library writing a letter to Winry about the goings-on of Central. (this is at a later date) Rose's son had grown up, Al is normal, and Winry is grown up. Ed and Al's old teacher comes to dinner with them and Al, for the 3rd time, asks if he can learn alchemy to bring Edward back.

Teacher: "" How could I ever say no to a face like that?""

and it showed how Ed crossed over the Gate, into our alchemy-less world, in Munich, 1925. He wants to talk to a scholar from Transylvania about a rocket that can go into outer space. He believes that Gate is up there, so he can return to his brother in his own world. It ends with them reaching into the sky. 

And then I started to bawl my eyes out. OHMAN. IT WAS SAD. 

OH! AND I SAW THIS MORNING THE EPISODES START OVER AT EPISODE 1 NEXT WEEK and the same time! If you can't stay up that late, tape it! It's worth it. Trust me. =D"

<br />yet flexible and diverse as well. Metal
<br />Elemental individuals reflect this in their
<br />unique and pragmatic outlook on life. They
<br />are possessed by frugality, never willing to
<br />spend more than is necessary, whether the
<br />cost is money, time, or something else. They
<br />are also somewhat minimalist because of this,
<br />choosing their ideas and items based on
<br />practicality rather than style or appearance.
<br />They have a very powerful will, usually
<br />manifesting itself as duty and honor;
<br />promises made to others take precedence over
<br />all else. They are also capable of changing
<br />and adapting to a wide range of situations or
<br />environments, but this adaptation is often
<br />not caused by their own decisions. Metal
<br />individuals sometimes come to adopt the
<br />ideals, styles, and mannerisms of those
<br />around them, without even noticing or
<br />understanding why. They express themselves
<br />through manual creativity, becoming highly
<br />inclined toward machines and technology, as
<br />well as being able to create arts and crafts
<br />with their hands.

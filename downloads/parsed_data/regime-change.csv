"event","today's LiVEJOURNAL entry will be about jobs, or ALL THE JOBS I'VE EVER HAD OR ARE CURRENTLY HOLDING. currently i hold two jobs: one, i am co-editor of design at the Technician, ncsu's student newspaper since 1920. two, i am a fledgling pharmacy technician at walgreens.

other jobs i have held: once, long ago, i was a writer for the Technician, and i mostly hated it. i also was a mens' fragrance salesmen at hechts, a shortlived occupation to be sure. for about one year, i worked in the on-campus convenience stores (""c-stores"") at ncsu. i've also, um.. yeah, that's really about it. 

i pretty much hated working at hechts. i got paid crap ($7, when i could've been making commission). customers were there in feast-or-famine terms, either non-existent or in droves. it was during the christmas season, and i had to work the day after christmas (HOLY CHRIST ALMIGHTY). i didn't know anything about mens' fragrances (it's called COLOGNE, OKAY?!) and i still don't. people asked me what i thought about a particular fragrance, and i... didn't care. it really didn't matter to me if i sold even one bottle. i spent most of my time obsessively cleaning the glass countertops prone to smudges and fingerprints. and smelling the coffee beans.

working at the c-store was okay, and pretty good for a slacker job, although i'm glad i don't work there now--apparently the rules about doing homework and reading while on the job have become stricter (that is, you CAN'T), which is pretty ridiculous. in some of the stores, there's so much free time to NOT DO ANYTHING that your brain numbs quickly, even with sudokus and crosswords. i can't imagine working there now, it would suck so bad.

i eventually was promoted to shift supervisor, and promptly quit the next day (actually, i moved to sweden). i'm quite glad i didn't return; although the job fit me pretty well for a while, my junior year was all about MOVING ON UP and the thought of working at the c-store for half of my college career frightened my career aspects. but while i was working there, it was pretty decent. the college crowd is absolutely the best demographic for a store; they don't have an attitude, they're fairly well educated, they don't ask for you to go out of your way, and they're pretty easy going. plus, even if you have to work on a friday or saturday night, you can still run into friends when they come into your store.

but now, NOW, i work at two different places. one, of course, is at the Technician as co-editor of design. although the pool of available designers for next year is pretty damn slim, i was still surprised to be offered this position. i'm not surprised helen was offered; she's a pretty keen choice, being in the college of design and all, and having worked as a designer longer than me. i've only been a designer for... one semester. in some aspects, i'm still kind of green. i don't hold any pretensions about being a star designer. at most, i consider myself capable. still, i am excited. i love all the other editors. except for my girlfriend and a handful of others, i don't have any friends outside of the Technician anymore.

i also recently started working at walgreens as a pharmacy technician, to gain experience for (possibly?) pharmacy school, and to decide if i actually want to do this pharmacy thing. it's definitely the most demanding job i've ever held, and unsurprisingly also the highest-paying job i've held. also, i actually feel kind of fulfilled by what i do. it's quite unlike other retail jobs where you sell stuff that people don't need, AND your knowledge and skills become pretty specialized. once i become a certified pharm tech, i'll get a pay raise of several dollars more and a leg up on all the other pharmacy school applicants. i'm honestly a little excited.

i forgot if all of this had a point. it's pretty much just rambling. IN THE NEXT ISSUE: I TALK ABOUT MY GIRLFRIEND."

"event","i've figured it out. the biggest obstacle to writing my great american novel is discovering what i'm supposed to testify about, like in that emerson poem. mrs. ingerham has inspired me like no one else has, ever--then and now. i realized this when kristal and i went to see her after school today.

it's so depressing that i never pursued an english degree. but i suspect that my passion for culture and (to a slightly lesser respect) literature may carry me through."

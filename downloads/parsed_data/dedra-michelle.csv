"event","Before I start, I wish I could tell you all of this in person.
You'd give me advice from a different perspective because we experience people differently.
We always did which is why we got along in the first place, so many years ago.
I know you know this, and it's okay.



I know I don't relate. No, not really. 
I've read enough books and seen enough movies to know how people are supposed to feel. 
I can pretend very well and I get better every day.
However,
I am beginning to realize I have a flaw that is resistant to change.
Because of my poor ability to relate I see MOST things as black or white.
There is no gray.

If you're not 100% sure, then you're not sure at all


This is how I feel.

Example: Is there a god? Proof of his/her existence is a gray area. No one can prove or disprove. I agree.

BUT Do you believe in god? Someone answers ""Kind of."" Well if you believed you'd say yes, so by saying anything else you're proving you don't believe because believing means you believe, no if ands or buts which means you don't believe in the first place.

Apparently this example is hard to process for most and thusly inspired our first real argument. Not about god, but about my black and white views of the world.

I don't want to fight about how I process information. I told you I had a problem before we started dating. Did you think I was joking when I told you I thought I had disscocial personality disorder? Human emotions are lost on me. Logic is how I understand. Gray areas aren't logical and I can't fucking process okay?

Then you had to lay it on me that I saved you somehow from your life before me.

I'm not ready to be your saviour. I'm not ready to be anyone's saviour. 

This is too much for me to process right now, if forever. Way too many of your emotions on your sleeve.

Throw that shit in the washer and come back later because I really like you."

No clever writing, no elusive phrases. Straight recollection.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/dedra_michelle/pic/00006e98/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/dedra_michelle/pic/00006e98/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

I went with Jake (from work) and his girlfriend, Debbie Downer. Even though Deadmau5 is Jake's favourite DJ she made them leave. So, here I am, alone, at this DJ show full of candy kids. I decide to just dance and have fun. I look next to me and the most gorgeous guy is dancing next to me, alone. I keep glancing at himout of the corner of my eye because I realize I am definitely not as cool as I used to be. No way this guy would be into me... Not that I should care because I'm not single, right?

Deadmau5 starts doing some sick shit on stage but alas, I am too short to see. Gorgeous guy notices, !, and motions for me to stand in front of him for a better view. And, that's all she wrote.

We ended up laughing, and dancing, then <i>dancing</i> then <i>really dancing</i> and I forgot about Steven. In all seriousness this wasn't me drunkenly dancing with someone at a Halloween party. This is me sober. He and I were lost in the music together, however cliche this may be, it felt like we were the only ones at the show. I wanted to fuck him. The way we were dancing was like basically having sex. Honest to god, I wanted to rip his trendy clothes off and have sex with his pierced body right then and there. Steven wasn't even on the same continent as my mind was... When the show ended I realized what happened, made up some excuse, and ran off to my car. I didn't give him my name or number even though I wanted to so bad it physically hurt. 

I have always thought about Steven. For the past 3 1/2 years I've always thought about him. At every party, show, club, everything. Except this time. And you know what? It was amazing. To be hot, and sexy, and excited with someone who's experiencing the same. I realized Steven, had he been off, would probably never have gone to the show with me because 1. none of his lazy ass friends would be there and 2. he would have already spent all of his money on pot. Steven and I used to be into the same shit, you know? And now? He's a fucking stoner who doesn't want to to anything except smoke, play beer pong, and watch tv (not with me, just with his buddies). Yet again another cliche, but I'm starting to realize there are cliches for a reason.

(A side note: When I saw Steven later that night, I definitely told him what happened. He blew it off and said ""It's just dancing"" I tried to explain to him that it wasn't but all he cared about was the fact that we didn't have sex.)

I don't think I want to be exclusive anymore. Yeah, I love Steven, but I think I want to see what else is out there. I want to live my life and do all this fun stuff with other people. I'm tired of saying ""I have a boyfriend, but he's at his friend's house"". Maybe it's a phase Steven is in, maybe it's not. But while he's trying to figure out what he's doing with his life, I'm going to be living my own. If Steven's not okay with it, then we'll have to go our separate ways because I am too lonely and too young to have a part time boyfriend. Woes me, this is the first time I've felt this way without a fight to provoke it. I'm pretty sure that's how I know it's legit. We weren't (and haven't been) fighting.

Now all I have to do is make sure this is actually what I want, and then tell him. Oh boy.

Sam will take me in and take care of me.
He'll marvel over the fact that I am almost half his age, young 
and pretty
and that if we were the same age I'd never be with him.
He'll drive me around in his sporty black car
and I'll happily help him make his cooking show.
He'll show me what a man is supposed to be
and do all of the things no one ever did for me.
It'll be like he's a father figure

We'll fuck all of our time away together.

And yeah, he'll take care of me."

The first ingredient is always the filling -- if it's a blueberry pie, the main ingredient is fresh blueberries -- if it's a strawberry &amp; rhubarb pie, the main ingredients are fresh strawberries and fresh rhubarb -- and you can definitely taste it, too. The next ingredient is flour, and there are eggs and some butter and stuff. Sugar is always near the end of the list. I haven't seen more than five or six ingredients total in any of their pies... and there are no preservatives -- I had an apple pie go bad after a week in the fridge! I need to get their larger pies, since they have a larger filling-to-crust ratio. I am able to demolish the larger half of one of their six-inch pies for lunch -- yum!"

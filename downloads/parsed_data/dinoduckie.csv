Here's an exact date for you.  On July 19, 2007, the Merriam Webster dictionary announced their list of new word entries for the year, including the trendy term, ginormous (the adjective that combines ""gigantic"" and ""enormous,""; an adjective for gigantic). But what about the word itself?  How long has ginormous been around?  From one mention of the term in 1992 and again in 1993 (and zero mentions in '94 and '95), ginormous took off and never looked back.  

But what about the very first ginormous?  The word doesn't appear in 1991 news archives.  Was 1992 the earliest use?

 

Not hardly.  The First Mention we found also has not only an exact date, but even identifies the originator. 

 

A news article about helicopter pilots in the May 13, 1951 issue of the Zanesville Signal in Ohio tells the tale of one Carl Agar...

 

    ""...short, tanned, hard bitten operator of Okanagon Air Service of British Columbia...Agar had a new adjective to describe the size of his operations.   

     

    ""They're ginormous,"" he said...""


    So our thanks to Mr. Agar for coining the word all

    those years ago, and to Merriam Webster for giving it

    solid recognition more than 50 years after the fact."

Then, they are sad because A) they are hurting you, and B) feel that when they are ready it will be too late and you will be gone.  That is the true definition of BITTERSWEET!  To know someone likes you is the sweet.  To know they aren't ready for you is the bitter."

This week has been VERY stressful and busy!  I have WAY overbooked myself job wise and socially!  I HAVE to learn to say no and to make time for Eryn...I never seem to come first for me...maybe that's why I don't come first for anyone else either...I also need to learn to space out appointments and schedule in sleep!  Now, I am spending the next 4 days catching up...OH, and my computer is a piece of CRAP!!!  I spent 45 minutes just trying to get it to turn on!  If you know how to fix it, please come over and do so....I will make you cookies or take photos of you or something...because I am broke until I can get it up and running to actually DO some work to make a profit!  Sometimes I wonder why I ever thought I could handle running my own business and then other times I know exactly why I did it.  This week I keep wondering why.  Hopefully by next week I will REMEMBER why!  Well, I have to get back to work now because obviously my computer has decided to turn on today!

"event","Hey there everyone!  I haven't been on here in a while!  I have realized though that this is the place to vent because all my friends are on here and the people I NEED to vent about will read it anywhere else!  

So, I have this friend who just got divorced and him and I got kinda close. I have known him for about 3 years.  His wife told him 2 years ago, ""I think we should be just friends""  How crappy is that?!?!  Then, his divorce was finalized April 4th.  He moved back into his mom's house and I helped with that.  He wanted to throw an ""I'm single again"" party and called me first. We have been hanging out a lot since about Feb. on a regular basis...once a week or so with a phone call every other day.  It wound up being me, his best friend, one of my friends, and his friend Angie from high school.  I figured there would be more people.  We went to 2 different bars and he was buying me drinks...we left and got back to his friend Pat's house (who I kinda like as well - he embraces my strangeness).  Jon was slow dancing with me while I was waiting to sober up so I could go home.  Then, Pat said he was going to bed and I could sleep on the couch if I wanted.  Jon said he was going to go home (just next door) and I could come watch a movie if I wanted.  I decided for the movie...I picked Star wars: Return of the Jedi...Then, Jon kinda leaned in and next thing I knew we were making out!??!?!  I did tell him that kissing a smoker - even if it is only when you drink - IS like kissing an ash tray!  Go me...Next thing I know, the movie is over and was waking up...not something I ever do.  Not in my character at all...I got up and left after waking him up to say goodbye, because I was definitely sober and I felt weird.  He came in the next day to visit me at work though!  So, that was a Wed. 

Then, that Saturday, The day before easter, after he went out to chinese with my friends and me, Jon said he was having a party with 40 women and they were all going out to the bar.  never really invited me, just told me about it.  I told him to have fun but I don't want to hear about it.  Then, Kerstin and I called him around 1am to see how the party was going.  (He has this friend of his whose name is Kelly but he himself calls her the hooker chest girl.  She BOUGHT herself double D breasts and when I met her she had a fitted zip up sweatshirt that was only half zipped and she had no shirt OR BRA on underneath.  Her face is caked in makeup...you get the picture.)  Well, he was in the car on the way home when we called with 3 guys and Kelly in the car.  I asked how the evening was going and he said way too much drama.  I said, what do you expect with 40 women in one room?  Kelly was shouting in the background trying to find out who he was talking to.  when he said it was me, she started talking smack about me!??!?  WTF!?!?  Then she took the phone from him and told me I had to come over and make her a f!%#ing steak!??!  I told her to go to Steak and Shake!  He finally took the phone from her and asked if I wanted to come over.  I said not if she was there.  I told him I bet he wished he had come over to color easter eggs with us now and he said ya he did.  My friend Kerstin and I started coloring easter eggs at 2 in the morning and my mom was still up and said the boiled ones were on the top shelf.  We decorated them and then I came up with the crazy idea that we should go and decorate Jon's car for easter.  I told my mom we would be right back and call if we needed bail money =P We had on our pj's, put on our purple lamb ear headbands that we got from target, grabbed my paint marker for car windows and headed out.  We got to his street and saw all the lights on at his house so we turned off the car lights, parked down the street and ran up to his house in a sneaky way.  we cleared off the snow on the side windows and painted on it.  Then, we wrapped the decorated eggs in paper towel and took some photos and took off running.  Kerstin said we should call him right away and I said it would take the fun out of it.  If we did that, we should have just knocked on the door and invited ourselves in, right?  So, we went home, cleaned up, and went to bed.  The phone rang at 6:30 am.  It was Jon.""so, I see you came over.  No one has ever PAINTED my car before.  Why didn't you come in?""  I said there was a first for everything and we didn't come in because we didn't know WHAT he was up to and we were in our pj's.  He said we should come over and drink with him.  I said, ""it is fucking 6:30 am on Easter sunday!""  Kerstin said we would be right over and hung up.  So, We got dressed and went over.  He fell asleep in about 15 minutes, so we took photos of us torturing him and left.  I went to work at noon and he called and left a message because I was busy.  ""well, good morning...so, it turns out that if you leaves eggs out in the cold and they aren't REALLY cooked, they explode.  And I am sure that raw eggs and paint jobs don't mix.  So, I will be cleaning that up all day and hopefully it comes off.  Well, talk to you later...""  I was SSSOOOO stunned.  I didn't mean for that to happen at all!!!!  I called him back and he said I inadvertently egged his car!  I could hear his mom yelling in the background and yelling about the car and all the beer bottles.  I told him to make sure she knew I did NOT do the beer bottles!!!  All I did was try to be cute and spontaneous and good thing I wrapped them in paper towel first because that is what saved the car...

So then he called me at about midnight that night to let me know it all came off and we kinda talked about the making out and him wanting to get a piece of ass...he said I probably have never had a boyfriend because I always bring my friends with me and I said did he ever think I brought  CHAPERONS around him for a reason???  I said that I wasn't ready for him and he wasn't ready for me because I am not giving out sex and he is definitely not ready for a committed relationship yet because he has only been divorced for less than a week   (at that point).  So, that was Sunday night.  

So then, he avoided me for about a week and I thought he was STILL Pissed about the car (which was not damaged).  My friend Bonnie called him a few times though and and he told her he was kind of avoiding me because he just wants to be friends right now and he feels bad about everything that has happened.  So I emailed him and said:

Hey there, 
how are you? I feel like you have been avoiding me lately. Its alright, I have kinda been avoiding you too. I still feel REALLY bad about your car first of all. Then, at work the other day, Lou and Todd were talking about your car getting egged by some awful person and how angry you were, so I had to set that straight...and look like the idiot that I am. Next, I would like to consider myself a friend of yours and friends are supposed to make your life easier and more fun through the hard times and all I feel that I have been doing is adding more stress and drama to it. And my friends probably aren't helping. I am sorry for all of that. You do know that I have never needed anything more than a friendship from you, right? I know things have gotten a bit crazy between us, but all of that is so out of my character. I don't regret anything by all means, but we could just call it fun times and move on. I really do like hanging out with you and your friends as well. I feel like we kind of agreed the other night that you are not ready for me and I am not ready for you. Please don't feel weird and avoid me because you think I want or need more than you can give right now. Chinese, the movies, and the playground with you are all I ever wanted in the first place...you know, fun, spontaneous stuff that friends do. Sometimes I overwhelm people and that is how I loose friends, but I hope that doesn't happen with us. I will not egg your car again either... 
Miss ya... 
Your Friend, 
Eryn 
 
He has kinda been ignoring me since then and he has been hanging out with Kelly as far as I have heard...well, who would choose me over a 10 cent cheap whore I guess...it shouldn't bother me that I found out he is shallow, but it does because I know he actually does like me, but I am too much for him to handle right now!??!  He really is a nice guy, but he is so confused right now and his whole life is out of wack...his wife was cheating on him which is why she wanted a divorce and now I guess he is looking for more people like her...I really do just want to be his friend though and he is avoiding me because he feels bad and my friends are always around when he is...I try to do stuff with just me and him, but he doesn't call me back any more...

Should I just stop while I am still kind of sane or keep pushing him to hang out with me vs. the skanks he has been hanging with...I guess in the end it is what he decides, but is he worth holding on to?"

I really want to go to Samoa someday after going there.  Watched tons of gorgeous sunsets!  Hiked up to a cool waterfall where marines were jumping from CRAZY HEIGHTS.  Christmas Eve mass at a cute little church that was too small so we had mass in a pole barn lit only by Christmas light with the mountains in the background.  Had to take my brother Josh to the emergency room on Christmas day.  He thought he had a parasite growing in his brain from swimming in the waterfall.  He had a really high fever, bronchitis and an ear infection instead.  I found an awesome coconut at the emergency room and shucked it and cracked it open and scooped all the coconut out.  Went to the beach for Christmas day and got my butt kicked by the huge waves.  I lost my flippers 3 times and my bathing suit 4 times.  Got some cool night photos of the stars.  Saw TONS of sea turtles!  Our hotel room was much bigger than I was expecting!  Rode the bus around the whole island and got to see it all.  My parents had there 31st wedding anniversary!  Got to go to the swap meet and bought my first bikini...7 out of the 9 people on my trip got sick with a fever and bronchitis on the trip.  I was NOT one of them!  Went to Pearl Harbor and saw a rainbow while I was there.  My brother and I did a lot of wandering the streets of Waikiki at night aimlessly.  Got to see the monk seals being fed at the aquarium.  My brother went deep sea fishing and caught 2 fish at once.  Went whale watching and brought my AWESOME camera but FORGOT my memory cards so had to use my little camera.  Saw 5 whales.  Got to make my own lei.  Hiked up Diamond Head crater.  New Year's Eve fireworks (it was like 4th of July here). Lost my phone, but I found it.  Got pretty tan, for me.  Honolulu has a cool Zoo!  Went parasailing 600 ft. in the pouring rain, but it was still pretty cool.  Went snorkeling at Hanuma bay Nature preserve and saw some SWEET reef fish.  Back got sunburned from snorkeling all day.  Got to crack my own oyster for pearls and got a rare blue one (once I traded my mom).  Got to take a limo to the airport!  The flight home actually FED us!  That is the short version of the rest of my trip.  If you want details on anything in particular or to see photos of anything, just ask!!!"

My Mom's friend got 4 tickets to see the sneak peek of HAPPY FEET in the IMAX theater and gave them to ME!!!!  The problem I came across was that Ethan and I promised eachother that we weren't going to see the without each other and we agreed on Monday.  I thought, ""maybe I could go and then go again Monday and pretend it was my first time...but I don't keep things from people like that, so I contacted him and told him what I had and he thought it was awesome!  So, I took him and my 2 nieces.  

I didn't think anything could get better than a movie about cartoon tap dancing penguins,   but I was wrong because I forgot about the words FREE and IMAX!   It was amazing!  It was so much better than I ever expected.  The music melodies reminded me of the movie Moulin Rouge.  All the classics - Prince, Queen - you get the idea.  Great cast of voices as well - Robin Williams, Elijah Wood, Brittany Murphy, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman - just to name a few.  The graphics were spectacular!  I couldn't tell sometimes weather it was a real photo or a drawing.  They had starry skies, the aurora borialis, melting icicles, and underwater scenes.  

EVERYONE NEEDS to go see this movie!!!!  See it in the IMAX if you get the chance because it is totally worth the extra money!   Ethan and I are talking about going to see it on Monday anyway...I hope we do because I really want to see it again already!"

"event","OMG!  The Chicago concert I got to work was awesome!  I got to hear the last few songs and then the band walked off stage past me and I got to talk to them!  Seem like cool guys.  Then, the roadie, Chuck (the sound guy) was really nice to me.  He is from southern Ohio and has the same accent as Keith.  Man, I miss him.  There is also a really cute and super nice stage hand named Paul and we got to talking.  I have run into him on a few more gigs since then and we go out of out way to talk to each other even if we aren't on the same crew.   Maybe we will start hanging out.  That would be fun. I love new friends!  I finished another wedding and I now only have (drum roll please) one left to edit!!!!! I am getting better the more I have but those first few were not as good as I wanted them to be to start with so I worked extra hard to make them look how I wanted.  I have gotten now equipment since then which really helps too.  I am working 9 hours tomorrow and on Wed. I have 18 hours!!!?!!?!?!  It is going to be crazy because my 2 calls are only 8 hours from each other so I will get less than that of sleep and then have to be up for 18 hours.  Its going to be GREAT!!!  I do so love the theatre!  I almost got hit in the head with a pop bottle today too... the 2 people I was working with got into this HUGE fight and the lady had to get dragged away kicking and screaming and punching and she started throwing stuff and I was in the line of fire and she had really bad aim for the guy she was shooting for!  

It's my Grandma's 85th birthday tomorrow!!!!  And I am hopefully going to get up early enough to vote before I have to work.  And then I have to run some errands because the next ERYN TIME I have is Monday!  Ya a whole week of constant work and sleep only before I have a day to myself!  I haven't been this busy in a while.  This used to be how my life was all the time.   I almost forgot what it was like..."

"event","In case we find ourselves starting to believe all the anti-American sentiment and negativity, we should remember England 's Prime Minister Tony Blair's words during a recent interview. When asked by one of his Parliament members why he believes so much in America, he said: 

""A simple way to take measure of a country is to look at how many want in... And how many want out."" Only two defining forces have ever offered to die for you: 

1. Jesus Christ 
2. The American G. I. 

One died for your soul, the other for your freedom."

"event","~You might not be his first, his last, or his only. He's loved before and he might love again. But if he loves you now, what else matters? He's not perfect, you aren't either, but if he can make you laugh at least once, and admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isn't going to quote poetry and he might not be thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you can break. Don't hurt him, don't change him, don't expect more than he can give, and don't analyze. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he's not there.~"

"event","It is very frustrating that the only place I DON'T want to be treated like a girl is the only place I DO get treated like one.  I am playing basketball and even if I am the only person open, the boys still will not pass me the ball.  Just because I am the only girl on the team does not mean I don't know how to play!  I am going to have to kick some ass next week.  They can't get rid of me by excluding me because I still get my exercise in so HA!  I will get better and they will never know what hit them!  I have fun even if I am shunned by the group of tough guys.  There are a few guys that give me a chance, but I am rarely on their team... They didn't draw blood this week, so I am already doing better...hopefully there is always one other girl that shows up so we can be ignored together every week..."

sometimes you picture me-- 
I'm walking too far ahead 
you're calling to me, I can't hear 
what you've said-- 
Then you say--go slow-- 
I fall behind-- 
the second hand unwinds

"event","I finally decided to go to The Fray concert today!  I was contemplating it.  I was about to go by myself because I couldn't find anyone to go with me, but Tara FINALLY called me back, and after a little friendly coercing, I got her to go with me.  So, with less than 2 hours before the concert, we got ready, got to the Deltaplex, found some secret free parking, got out tickets for cheaper than online, and got AWESOME seats 6 rows from the stage!  The opening band was called The Feeling and they are from London.  Cutie pie accents!  Their music was like The Beatles meet The Beach Boys with a twist of Ben Folds Five...I loved it!  The Fray is just awesome and they are as great as I was expecting.  The piano player is AMAZING!!!  And the drummer couldn't stop smiling!  He looked like he was having such a great time!  And the guitar player surprisingly sang as many leads as the piano player and has an incredible voice with a miraculous range!  It was really weird being at a concert that I had to pay to get into (not GET paid to be there) and that I wasn't enjoying it from a roadbox backstage.  The lighting was spectacular as well.  Kudos to the designer.  There was a bit of feedback in the audio though.  The place was FULL of lit up cell phones EVERYWHERE...it was a beautiful site though-like looking DOWN on the stars in the night sky.  There were a few lighter, but not enough to brag about.  All in all, it was a marvelous day with good company and great entertainment!"

"event","Why do people feel that they can use and abuse me - my kindness, my trust, my friendship - and then feel that they can use me and treat me like utter crap and then after breaking my heart, try to come crawling back into my life and be the best of friends all over again...most likely so they can do the same thing again someday! I know I am a very caring and trusting and open person, but I am human and can only take so much before you all make me a cold-hearted, uncaring person. So, here are some words of wisdom for you, if you are my friend, don't stab me in the back or use me or lie to me or or treat me like crap because I am so sick of it and one day I will cut you off from me. I am an AWESOME friend and don't you abuse that privilege, because I am only giving people one chance from now on. No second chances to break my heart and make me cry myself to sleep. If you are my friend, be as loyal and trustworthy to me as I am to you. I do NOT find that too much to ask!!! If you abuse all that then you are not worthy of me and you should either spend the rest of your life trying to make it up to me or just don't bother and move on because I will have a hard time trusting you EVER again...sorry to the great friends I do have that have to read this, but take this as your warning...If I get you sent to jail, don't bother calling me when you get out!!! (Can you tell I am very angry and upset with someone?) No more second chances...no more...my heart can't take it and I do not have enough tears left for that...I cried enough the first time...I believed in you once, but you killed that, don't expect me to do it again!

"event","So, once again my family screws me over!  Wow, sometimes I don't know what to do.  My whole family was planning a trip to Hawaii for Christmas and New Year because my little sister is living there with a friend right now so we would have a place to stay and a kitchen and maybe even a car to use.  So, we all got our plane tickets and time off work and everything.  Well, Cari got into a fight with her friend and is now coming home in a week and we have NOWHERE to stay when we go to Oahu...And it is REALLY expensive to lodge 9-10 people for 18 days in Hawaii and we thought of camping, but they only have camping on the weekends from what I have researched.  So, now instead of just worrying about transportation on a daily basis, we need to worry about a roof over our heads too!  I don't know if we can cancel our plane tickets or not.  I know that my older sister is PISSED because she REALLY wanted the family vacation..the most ironic part, Cari will be in MI for the holidays because she has no money and that was the reason we were going in the first place-so our family could be together for the holiday season...bah humbug...I am not going for broke because of another family miss hap...I already have a broken heart.  I don't need a broken bank too!"

I went to get a new lens for my camera and when I got to the store they were back ordered, but online it said they were in stock.  They could get the lens by early Thursday, but that would be too late.  I was bummbed, but asked them to order it anyway.  The guy called me the next morning (Tuesday) and said it was in!  I was shocked.  When I got there to pick it up, I asked the guy how he got it so fast.  He said that he drove down to the Kalamazoo store after he got out of work the night before to pick it up because he knew I needed it!  How cool is that?!?!

"event","I went to a Whitecaps ball game with Tara, Ethan, Tyson and Tara's friend Ruth on Friday.  I was on the phone and read my book the whole time or I was talking to Tyson.  It was okay and I got 2 loaves of free bread out of it at the end of the game and a free ticket to begin with.  Then, Tyson and I go to leave and Tara and Ethan THEN decide they want to talk to me.  After we left, Tyson asked if I was going to dinner on Saturday with then and Nicholas (old roommate) who is going to be in town.  Well, I wasn't informed or invited which was the whole purpose for Ethan getting out to talk to me.  I got off work anyway because I want to see Nicholas.  So, I called Nicholas and he was upset that I wasn't informed.  He is just passing through town for a day on his way to his great grandma's because she is not doing too well.  So, I was going to get to see Nicholas!!  Yesterday was a good day with bad news...bittersweet if you will.  I got a text from Brad Sat. morning to call him when I can cuz he is in town, so of course I call him right back!  He flew into GR that morning and wanted a friend to talk to.  His dad was in the hospital after having a heart attack and is having surgery on Monday.  I got dressed and rushed right to the hospital.  Everyone seems to be doing well and his dad is okay for the circumstances.  After I left him and got home, Nicholas called me and said he was almost to my house and wanted to hang out before everyone else came along, so we got to chat for awhile and I got to show him his wedding photos that I am working on.  Then, Ethan and Tyson showed up and we sat around waiting for Tara to get out of work and then we were off to Mongolian BBQ!  One of the cooks married me with his eyes while we were there!  But he looked like he was about 19 or 20 so...beautiful eyes though....Dinner was great and Nicholas and I had great fun and great food.  After dinner we dropped Tara off at home and came back to my house to watch The 5th Element.  Good movie!  Tyson and Ethan fell asleep, so me and Nicholas pestered them and enjoyed the movie!  All in all it was a good day and I had tons of fun even though there was bad news involved which brought people here to begin with...its always nice to see the friends you never get to see.  I will drop stuff for that all the time!  Pray for the health of my friend's families though."

"event","so let me just say that the scenario is playing out exactly as I have prophesied and pretty much exactly on cue.  You know the story of my cousin and the boy I was excited to see.  Well, he has been in town for almost a week now and today was the FIRST day he has even ATTEMPTED to contact me.  He has SEEN my cousin at least twice now though.  He called and left a message (because I am screening my calls) and said he was doing nothing today and thought I should drive all the way to Muskegon to see him...sorry buddy, right now I so don't think you are worth the gas money.  I can bet you anything that I got a call because Tara has to work.  I was at work though and texted him that I would be done at 7 or 8 and he could just come here and see me...well, he was going to be busy then was the text back (probably meaning that Tara gets out of work at 7). 

I guessed that Ethan's brother would want to hang out with him too now that he is in town and Ethan would not want to do that, so to solve the problem of getting both of us off his back he should try to hook us up.  Well, guess who called today...Ethan's brother Tyson.  He is a good guy, just not my type...not sarcastic and witty enough for me.  I can take him in small bits though.  Well, he asked what I thought about the idea of him asking me out...and I said ""out where?""  Just in general. I told him that in the way of hanging out we could totally do that but in the way of boyfriend I would not think he would be able to handle it with the weird hours and jobs that I do.  We could never really plan things and that would drive him NUTS!  He said it came as a thought when he went to dinner with Tara and Ethan on Thursday!!!  Grrrr to the both of them because they know that Tyson and I are not a match at all and we have all discussed the topic in detail before.  I am even madder than I was before and I told Tyson to tell Ethan that I think he is a jerk if he talks to him.  Tara hasn't tried calling me today.  I wonder if she has caught on that I am ignoring her?  Her and I NEVER go more than 22 hours without conversing and I haven't talked to her since Wednesday...If it were me, I would have went to her house by now to see her in person and find out just exactly what the problem is.  Or used the phrase, ""are you mad at me?"" on a voicemail...but she has stopped leaving those...I can find better friends than the ones who you introduce to each other and then they just cut you out of the equation immediately!  Who the hell does that.  After meeting once they think that I do not have to be involved in the friendship anymore.  Tyson made the comment that, ""no offense, but she must be way cooler than you for him to just cut you off like that.""  So he sees it to.  I am not just paranoid...and no I do NOT think that she is way cooler than me...we are about the same in coolness...I think that I am even more willing than her to have a little fun!  So good riddance to you both...I deserve better and will put a new effort into finding better as well!!!  Friends shouldn't do that and FAMILY is forbidden...there is some unspoken rule that has been crossed here and I am apparently the only one that gives a damn!  

Well, I have to go and bary myself in work like I always do when my heart gets broken or stabbed into...it is either that or to leave the country and I have too much work to do to be able to do that.  I will keep you updated...if you even care..."

I was going to get to see him so much more and it was going to be the first time since I have known him that he was girlfriendless.  Well, what the hell do I know!  Ya, so when he came down for that weekend, we went to my cousin's grandma's cottage for a day.  WELL, apparently since that day Ethan doesn't really bother calling me at all, but has been talking to Tara almost everyday since then!  Tara took me out to the movies today and as I was leaving her house she told me all of this and that they will be hanging out a lot now that he is downstate.  She was like,""Well, he wanted to hang out tonight, but I told him I had to go to the movies with you...But you aren't my substitute friend...""  When you actually have to TELL someone something so assinine as that it means that you really ARE the substitute!  I feel like its freshman year all over again.  When will I get my break?  When will I actually like someone that likes me back?  I need to get the hell out of here.  Can I move in with any of you out there?  Help me find a job somewhere far away from  here.  I will start all over and not be so nice and naive and gullible this time around...trust no one...play with people's minds...break some hearts...I would make a really good matchmaker though don't you think?  I hate my life and sometimes I hate my frinds and the worst part is that Tara is my cousin!  I can expect heartbreak from friends, but from FAMILY!?!??!   It hit me like a blow to the head... I am playing cool around them though...no point in all 3 of us being miserable, right?  I HATE hanging out with couples to begin with, but now I am just going to be the charity case with the 2 of them.  Keith was right, friends should not date friend's friends.  There is an invisible line that should not be crossed unless permission is given.  I dunno, lets just pretend I don't care and see how it goes.  Why am I not as attractive to people as anyone I know.  They prefer to hang out with my friends over me every time...I am a looser and I will become a loner if it kills me because in the end, you are always alone..."

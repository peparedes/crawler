"event","good morning all. last night was crazy and stressful. i came online at about 9:15 and talked to dz and we were talking about how i wanted to hang out with everyone tomorrow while im down and dz like flips on me n was like dont start anything with mel blah blah blah. why the fuck would i start something with her? i will say this one lst time and only once I AM HAPPY SHE IS WITH HIM! i know i could never make rick happy the way mel does because i live 200 miles away. we arent sure if thats really true but we say it anyways lol. so i sent the convo to colin and he goes back and tells dz to stop threatining me. lol he wasnt really threatining but i was just kinda like wtf you know. all i have ever said were nice things about mel and then i get jumped on and told not to start anything. what kind of person do they think i am and if they are all refuring to the kelli thing then let me straiten that out. when kelli walked into adephia's and meg told her i was dating her ex she gave me a drity look. end of story that is why i said shit about kelli. now that i think about you guys could be getting your information for other girls at eastern. that makes me laugh. that goes back to the whole chris thing when i got all in Lizz's face but come on ppl he fucking cheated on me with her! well rick and i are talking ill write later.

"event","hey. i just got home from the mall and didnt buy anything. i wanted to buy new jeans for wedsday so i'd look cute in all new clothes but nothing fit me right. today was an okay day. i woke up at like 10 and watched 7th Heaven for awhile. then i ate and then listened to Simple Plan for awhile. then i came online and talked to rick. i asked him if he wanted to chill. like all of us when i come down. he said he'd ask mel. i am kinda excited because i wanna met her. just knowing she makes him happy makes it all okay. even if he doesnt miss me at all as long as he is happy i am okay with it. and from what ive heard about her she seems really nice. i really want this to work without me getting upset or anything. i think it can, colin doesnt though. i brought it up to him last night and he told me i was setting myself up. i would be kelli. well thats great ill have mel talking shit about me while her and rick r holding eachother in a corner lol. hahahaha sry that makes me laugh! just to think of me being the jelous one. i know i will be but im not gunna let it bother me. i am stronger then that. i know why rick left and i just have to keep reminding myself that he left because of distance and nothing else. i will all be okay. like i am not gunna totally lie and say that i dont miss him and wish we were still together but i am not gunna go into total melt down like i did with chris. okay time to change the subject. well while alison and i were at the mall i saw Robbie. Gail's nephew who i had like the biggest crush on for like years. lol. i walked into the mall and he was with like a bunch of his friends and he goes ""hi brit. how are you?"" and i said hi back and he goes ""you dont remember me to you?"" and i said no and then he told me who he was and he came up an hugged me. he looks totally different. good different but diffrent. we talked for awhile about school and family and stuff and then we went our seperate ways. i thought about how much i used to like him and just laughed alot thinking about how imature i was when he used to come on the bus lol. i got my mind off other shit for awhile until alison said ""well at least it got your mind off rick."" and then i started thinking agian lol. ahhh i wish this stuff wouldnt happen to me. i want him to be happy but i want him to be happy with me. i know its so selfish and i wish that wasnt really what i wanted but in my heart of hearts i want my licence so i can drive down and just show up and tell him how much he means to me. ohh shit he is probablly gunna read this and think that is my plan for wedsday well if you are reading this. its not i made a promise to myself that no matter how bad i wanna say it i am not gunna. i am just gunna act like we never had a history like we have always been just friends. i really think it will work. well yeah i am gunna go because i wanna check other people's live journal's and then i am gunna go play Sims 2 with alison. after dinner i am gunna play Madden 2005 with tyler. i played last night and an actually starting to understand football. you guys should be proud of me we will actually have something interesting to talk about hehehehehe. well dinner is almost ready i'll write later tonight.

"event","Sry i havent written. The power has been out on the whole second floor since Friday morning. So here is an overveiw of my Christmas and Christmas Eve.

Christmas Eve..

woke up early and went to breakfast. after breakfast Mom Alison Gary and I went to see Polor Express but the dumbasses took it out of Lowes' for the day! What is up with that. so we saw A Seires of Unfortunite Events..cute movie kinda sad..when we got home we cleaned a bit and took pictures and waited for Gary's family to get here. they did. we all talked and blah blah for about 3 hours then we opened gifts and ate food. I called Meg and Katie and talked to them for awhile. Asked who was all gunna be there Wedsday stuff like that. Then called Linda and talked to her for like an hour and a half. Everyone left around 9:00 and then we cleaned up and got to open one gift each from Mom and Gary. I got Sims 2! Then i went to bed. I cried a little because you know it would have been our one month and everything.

Christmas Day...

woke up at ( but had to wait until 930 to open gifts so i read for awile. Then Mom came in at we all went out and opened gifts. I got my digital camera and i was very excited. I also got the new Simple Plan CD and 7th Heaven Season One! after opening all the gifts mom and tyler started cooking breakfast so i called Katie and Meg and wished then a Merry Christmas. I was gunna call Rick just to wish him one but i thought i would make me seem like i was desprate or something so i didnt call. We ate and then i sat on the couch and watched the first disc of Season One. Then after that was over it was like 4 and i put on the Simple Plan DVD and listened to the whole soundtrack and cried listening to number 8 and 9. Then i got a shower and just chilled until dinner then i dont remeber what i did and then the family played Triva Persuit DVD and Gary Ali and I won. Then I went to bed. 

Today..

woke up at 10. called linda. she couldnt come over because she had to babysit. got dressed. took pictures. watched 7th Heaven. went to Borders. Came home ate begels and played Sims 2. Left for Mackenize's. Hung out there until 730 came home and here i am. i have to go put pictures on my webpage so yeah i'll write tomorrow or later tonight. ohh on the way home from Mackenzie's most deff. herd my boo and got teary. fuck i miss him! i dont want to because everytime i miss him i feel guity because i am happy that Mel has the chance with someone so great and then i get mad at myself for being so selfish. he doesnt love me and never did so i just have to move on but i'll be reading or something and remeber the way he kissed me and it all starts up agian. like right now lol. ""all i need is one more day with you""

hey all. i dont know what to do anymore. i am so sad about everything. its all just falling apart and i hate it. i havent been online all week and no one has updated thier LJ so i have no idea whats going on. last night i finished this book i was reading and it was really good. i cried at the end though because the book was about this girl who wasnt happy with herself because she was a little overweight and she found the perfect guy. the guy who said she was beautiful and look amazing in anything..even when she would answer the door in her sweats..and this guy he was like this big player and then he fell in love with her and it was really sweet. He asked he to marry him and they lived happily ever after. It made me kinda said because i had that guy. he one who would hold me and tell me that he didnt even notice my cruches. and i lost him. i lost him and i have no way of getting him back because i am pretty sure after all the shit that was said even if he wasnt with mel he wouldnt want me back. i looked at our picture last night and i was just thinking how happy we both looked and then remebered how we would fight all the time just because i was dumb and selfish and pushed him away like ive done with any other guy ive dated. i want to be love so bad but when i get it i want everything to be so perfect and i wind up messing it up. of course i am saying all this because tomorrow is Christmas Eve and that would have been...yeah well. i dont know. i want to see him on the 29th but i dont at the same time beacuse the whole time i'll just want to be in his arms and i lost my chance. ahhh i am not lettin katie n joe hook me up anymore. i fall to fast and end up hurt. i just want him back and i cant have him. and now i have like no friends either. katie and i havent talked since ive been in jersey last and even then it was quite between us. meg is like my only close friends cos colin and i dont talk anymore cos i messed that one up too. well i am gunna leave and go to lunch because i dont wanna sit here thinking any more. i am gunna try and get online when i get home. mom and i are talking agian and thats good. alison mom and i are going to see the polor express tonight i cant wait. well ill write later.

"event","wow life sux. i got grounded for fighting with mom last night and now i have to stay after today because i didnt read this short story for Porcelli. i didnt get to go online last night to talk to colin so i have no idea what is goin on there. i am so hurt over all this shit i really dont even care anymore. i am sick of caring and crying over everything. i miss rick really bad and i dont want to. i am not supossed to care. i am supossed to just let it all go but i cant. he ment alot to me and no matter how hard i try not to think about it about what it used to be about how great it was to be with him i wind up thinking about it anyway. i wish i could be happy but im not. i said that when i was with rick i was happy and everything was great. yes i was happy with him but my inner pain was still there. bein with him just covered the visual pain up for awhile. i want to be happy. i need to be happy. it sux that i am realizing all this around the holidays which are supossed to be happy times but i am far from happy. there is no one to blame. it is no ones fault. its just the way it is. i wanna see everyone when i go down on the 29th but that could be bad too. because it would just make everything worse. i dont get to go to dr.isabelle today because i have to stay after and i really need to talk to her. ahhh well i have to do work. i'll write tomorrow if i get out of being grounded. i am sorry for everything

"event","i dont wanna be depressed. being depressed just makes me bitchy and when i am bitchy i fight with people. mostly my family. i dont really wanna say i am depressed but more just in pain. everything i want in my life goes wrong. i want love but cant seem to hold onto it long enough. my biggest thing was wanting to live in jersey to be closer to the people who really give a shit about me. that one didnt happen because daddy moved to new jersey. now i have that feeling that everyone is mad at me agian and i am not really sure why. well i know why rick and colin are mad at me. they are mad because i open my mouth without thinking about what i am gunna say and start fipping out not realizing what ive said until it to late. and its not just to them. i am doing it to everyone around me and dont know what to do about it. its drving me crazy that i am pushing away the people that mean the most to me. i am not happy with myself and i want to change it but i am so stuck on the fact that i am alone that its all i think about. my friends are getting sick of me and dont wanna be with me anymore. i hardly talk to katie or joe. when i talk to meg i complain to her and i know she doesnt wanna hear it anymore. frankly i am getting sick of it myself but i dont know what to do. i will not be happy with my life until i am in jersey and even then i will still be alone so idk. i know rick is probablly gunna read this and think i am blamming him for leaving me which i am not. i understand why he left i do and there is nothing i can do about it and neither can he so we just have to move on. Colin and i had our first fight last night. over rick..wow how the tables have turned lol. Rick now knows that i have feelings for Colin and i didnt want him to find out because i know once he did things would get bad between Colin and i which things did. I can only blame myself for the whole situation because i8 should have been honest with myself and everyone else from the beginning. maybe if i had told how i really felt then most of this wouldnt have happened. i dont know that for a fact though. i tried saying Colin was my best friend to try and convince myself that i didnt have feelings for him. it lasted for awhile but then we rick was thinking about leaving me i decided it was time to let everything out. 

I really wanna say I am sorry to everyone.

Katie, you know i love you but things just havent been the same with us for awhile. i am talking since Chris. I think i just have to stop dating your friends lol. Katie I love you. You are like my best friend and I dont wanna lose you. I know you are going through some really hard times right now and i get that you dont really wanna talk about it but i will always be here if you need me.

Meghan Laura, I love you to death. You have been there for me through everything. I am so greatful that i have been able to trust you and talk to you. I do feel like i have taken you for granted in a lot of situtations. We have become really close and you are like my best friend. I just hope that i havent runied our friendship forever. I love you.

Joe, You and i used to talk alot about a ton of shit but now we dont talk at all. I know some of it had to do with rick weather you want to admmit it or not. Joe you are a great person. We have had some good times together. I just hope everything works out and we can work on getting close agian.

Rick, I owe you the biggest i am sorry ever, you were nothing but great to me and i totally turned around and was a bitch to you. We had some great two days together lol. And you were even willing to try and make our relationship work from like 20000 miles away. Yes we both had huge trust isses but we almost got over them. Then you realized that no matter how hard we both worked at it. Being together would just not work for us. I understand completely why you did what you did. I am sorry for all like fights and yelling and flipping and bitching and everything else i did to you because you didnt deserve one bit of it. I hope that one day we can try to work at us agian but until then being your friend is all i need. Never forget Gifts and Curses-Yellowcard!!

Colin, You are another one I owe I huge I am sorry to, I almost messed up your and rick's friendship because I needed someone to talk to someone who understood me. I also took you for granted. You are a great person and an even better friend. I just hope that after last night you are still willing to be my friend. I am really sorry for everything and I hope there is a way you can forgive me. 

Alex, You are my sister and I have treated you so horrible. I knew you and Will were having problems and I opened my mouth to you knowing how greatful I would be just to have someone love me like Will loves you. Al even though things have gotten better between us they are not as great as they used to be. I am sorry for every mean thing ive ever said to you. I love you and I want things to be like used to. I hope we can work at it.

Alison, You and I used to be soooo tight. But ever since High School and guys have gotten into all of this things havent been the same. We fight alot more and I feel asthough you dont tell me as much as you used to. I know I have done and said some not very nice things to you and I am sorry. Ali remember all the fun times we used to have. All our crazy games and inside jokes. God i miss all that. Well babe I love you and I am hoping we can work through all our issues. Butter Cup Sister 4 Life!!

I am really sorry to everyone I have caused pain to and I hope you all find it in your hearts to forgive me, I dont me today or tomorrow because I know some of you ive hurt pretty bad but maybe someday we can work things out.

Snow day today i'll write later!

Papa Roach-Scars

[Chorus:]
I tear my heart open, I sow myself shut 
My weakness is that I care too much 
My scars remind me that the past is real 
I tear my heart open just to feel 

Drunk and I'm feeling down 
And I just wanna be alone 
I'm pissed cause you came around 
Why don't you just go home 
Cause you channel all your pain 
And I can't help to fix myself 
Your making me insane 
All I can say is 

[Chorus]

I tried to help you once 
A kiss will only vise 
I saw you going down 
But you never realized 
That your drowning in the water 
So I offered you my hand 
Compassions in my nature 
Tonight is our last dance 

[Chorus]

I'm drunk and I'm feeling down 
And I just wanna be alone 
You shouldn't ever came around 
Why don't you just go home? 
Cause your drowning in the water 
And I tried to grab your hand 
And I left my heart open 
But you didn't understand 
But you didn't understand 
You fix yourself 

I can't help you fix yourself 
But at least I can say I tried 
I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life 
I can't help you fix yourself 
But at least I can say I tried 
I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life 

[Chorus x2]"

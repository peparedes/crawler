My family came to visit me today.&nbsp; I realized just how much I&nbsp;miss them and how happy I really was at home, although I will never admit it out loud.&nbsp; I take for granted the pace of life back at home.&nbsp; Everything just seems simpler there than in the city.&nbsp; I guess it also harks back to my high school days when life really was simpler (if I had only known that then).&nbsp; I miss my family so much now.&nbsp; I never give them enough credit for all they do for me.&nbsp; One day I hope I will."

I have not posted to this account in about four years.&nbsp; I am extremely embarrassed by the layout of my account.&nbsp; Keep in mind that at the time I made this, I was in high school and had just come out.&nbsp; I was slightly over-enthused about the whole process, but I guess I had the right to be.&nbsp; It was a big deal, damn it!&nbsp; 

Well, I am now four years older and four years wiser (in some areas more than others).&nbsp; I have grown and matured in more ways than I can count, though I still procrastinate on homework, like right now. 

I think I'll start posting in here again just to see the differences (and similarities) in my life.&nbsp; I'll try to be a bit more detailed as to the events and why they made me feel certain emotions.&nbsp; I'll try to keep this updated often, but I can make no promises!&nbsp;

On a side note about today...I need to get over it...it will prolly never happen, not for lack of me wanting it to.  Damn me.

Well tomorrow I have a lovely English essay to write, I want to go to the library, and I have a poster to make for personality and behavior.  I can't wait.  (HA!)  Then I have to work....oh boy.

"event","Well hello everyone.

Life has been pretty good.  I think that today has been one of my most summer-ish days all summer, but it was kinda scary too.  Well it started off fine....I was watching The 70's House (omg luv that show)...and my dad comes out acting kinda strange...like he's on drugs.  So I'm like ""Dad are you ok...?""  And he's like ""Yeah"".  Well my dad is diabetic.  So I called my mom and she's all feaking out and stuff...so i had to go wake my dad up (he had gone back to bed)...and make him eat some canned peaches, and then I made him eggs and pancakes with really sugar-y surup.  It was really scary though...cuz he was acting so weird...and he kept wandering around asking where he was and stuff...it feaked me out....but he's all better now.

So after that ordeal the day was pretty good...I ended up going to peru with my mom and brother.  We went to Target...where I got cd's.  And then we ate dinner at Steak 'N Shake, and then went to the mall, where I got some new clothes.  It was a good night.  And just the way things happened today made it seem very summer-ish.  I dunno how to explain it.

Well tommorw is a movie with Danielle, and Friday-Saturday is WORK!  Grrr...but I have no money after the mall....so yeah. 

Luv Ya All!  And See you on Monday at school! (Well most of you!)"

Well today started out ok, ya know, got out of bed and everything was going good.  Then I got in a huge fight with my brother, which I was overdue for anyways, but it still was not fun.  Then I went to practice my clarinet, becuz i am such a loser.  Well then I dropped the bottom half of it, and broke it...AGAIN!!!!!!   This is like the fifth time!  So now I am thinking how much money to set aside to get it fixed, and how the hell to get ahold of Miss Rec, who never seems to answer the phone or have the answering machine on.

Well it has been a little while, so where to start.  The past week was blah, nothing new, except that I got an A on my six mile road test!  Woot!!!

So Friday I started working at Monte's.  Of course I start on like the busiest night EVER!  And I don't even get tips until I am done with the ""training"" period.  Grrr...  Oh well, I still get paid for being there, too bad it's like nothing.  So yeah, it was really busy, and the kid training me was honestly doing worse than I was.  That made me laugh, and then I had to go clean a table.

Saturday, I woke up at ten.  I then called Candace's mom's cell to see what time I needed to show up at where ever.  I found out that I need to be at Candace's house at TEN!!!  Obviously no one had called me to tell me this, since I had missed the practice the night before to work.  So I rushed like hell and got there at 10:45.  That is really good for me, considering I had to put on a tux and crap.  So I ended up being there at the perfect time, go me!  So then we just ended up taking pictures, sitting around, taking more pictures, sitting around, taking even MORE pictures, and then finally we went to the church.  The quincenera ceremony was boring, but when is going to church not boring?   

So then after the ceremony, Sammy called her aunt to come and pick us up.  So then we go back to her aunts house, which was in Streator (so was the church), and we wait for sammy's aunt and cousins to get ready.  So we wait, and wait, and wait, and then finally at like 3:15 we leave.  Too bad we were supposed to be at the Elks Lodge at 3:30, ""or you will die.""  -Candace's Mom.  So we speed back at like 80 mph and get there at 3:35.  Me and Sammy rush inside, and Candace's family WAS NOT THERE!  Omg, we were so mad, but honestly were too tired to care.  So then we took more pictures, ate, messed around, and danced.  Dancing was awesome.  So that was Saturday.

Today I went to the mall and got some new work clothes, that was about it.  And on the way home we stopped at Dairy Queen and I got a blizzard!  It was chocolate chip cookie dough, yummy!  So then I came home, practiced, ate, and had to go to work.  Tonight the place was much calmer, and I worked with a different kid, Robert, who goes to Marquet.  So work was relatively easy, still no tips though!!!  Ugh, I am tired of being a ""trainee"", I know how to clean and set a table!  So because of work I had to miss pride, which would have been awesome.  But there will always be next year, when I can drive!  

So that has been my life, luv ya's!

Well my weekend was okay, nothing too exciting happened.  

Friday night I had to take my brother to the carnival, but it turned out to be fun because laura, caty, josh, katie, morgan, and sammy were there!  So it turned out to be a fun night, for me anyways.

Then Saturday I didn't do much, just some stuff around the house.

And yesterday not much happened either.  I helped my mom wash her car, and did some more stuff around the house.

So this may sound odd, but I think this weekend I discovered that I am not the ugliest person on Earth!  Most of my life I have thought of myself as horribly unattractive and fat, which was true for a while i guess.  But I finally felt confident with myself.  Sure, I'm not perfect, but I am comfortable with where I am, and plan on trying to improve myself, which I know will take some time.  But that was just something that I thought I would share because it made me feel good.

Luv Ya's!!!  Brandon

ps- an interesting side-note, my parents are getting dish network!  I guess that diserves a Woot!  I can finally watch ""The N"", my fav channel that I always watch when I babysit, lol.  Okay, the end!"

But last night was fun, which is the reason I am now grounded.  I guess I prolly should have called to tell my parents I would be a little later in getting home than I thought.

"event","Well I am officially in the ""summer swing"".  I luv it.
Today I started driving.  I can tell that it is going to be THE biggest snore-fest ever, but at least it will allow me to get my license!!!  
I cannot believe nice out it has been either!  I went swimming today, which was fun, and maybe I will go tomorrow too.  Except that now I have no money...  
Only five weeks and three days of class left... bleh.  I can make it... I think.  w/e
Well that was random, anyways, COMMENT!  I luv ya's!

"event","Well summer is finally upon us!  About frickin time!  So for the past two days I have been mondo productive!  Just today I have:

-Actually cooked a REAL breakfast!

-Washed dishes

-mopped floors

-vacumed (sp?)

-practiced both my clarinet and saxophone

-visited my grandma

-cleaned some more...

And yesterday was rather similar to today, minus visiting my grandma.  So yesterday I went to the pool because it was super sunny out, but the water was FREEZING!!  Zita, Beth, Dani, Ms. Elizabeth, and Brenden were there.  I talked to Dani for a bit, but that was it.  I did get to work on my tan for a long time!  I needed it!  So I don't know what to do for the rest of today.  I should probably excercise some, but that really doesn't sound like fun.  Eh, maybe I will go for a walk or bike-ride later on.  So tomorrow night is graduation.  Good-bye seniors!  *tear...  I am NOT looking forward to sitting there and playing FOREVER and being REALLY HOT!  But what can you do?  Well that is about it for now, buh-bye!

Well tonight, instead of hanging out, I took my little brother to see ""Star Wars"".  I just want to say that it was awesome!  ...And Hayden Christensen is HOTT!!!  

So now I am here.  I should be excercising or something, I have been so lazy today, and I feel icky now.  It's hard to describe, I just don't feel good when I am not being productive.  I guess that's a good thing.  Anyways... g2g!

But I dunno, eh, I really have no reason to feel crappy.  I do have one complaint, but I am not going to say it here, I am going to talk to him about it.

Well tomorrow is tuesday, the week is slowly going by.  I dunno why I am excited about school getting out, I have to go back there four days a week for driving! Blech!  But at least I will be able to drive!  woohoo!

I can't believe the year is already about over!  I have been through SOOO much this year.  I have met so many new people, made new friends, and strengthened old relationships.  I cannot wait for summer, but I never want this to end. (Well maybe the whole ""school work"" thing, lol)  
I hope I can stay in touch with more people over the summer than before, I really need to be social and not all reclusive!

So today I was super tired, along with what seemed like everyone else in school.  Plus it was cold outside, I HATE THE COLD!!!  Half the kids in the play didn't even show up for school today, it was odd.  w/e

So after school was strike, which went really fast and wasn't too bad.  But that means that it is 100% over.  *Tear.  But I can't wait for the next one!

Now I am sitting here, procrastinating homework that I should prolly be doing, and trying to resist eating a brownie, they are EVIL!!!

It also makes me sad though, because after tomorrow it is over, and that is it until next year, and then it won't be the same, because so many wonderful people are leaving!  *tear

And then after the play was the cast party, it was just a blast!   I haven't had so much fun in a long time.  

And then Matt! I AM SO HAPPY!!! I feel on top of the world right now and I never want it to end!  I just haven't felt this good since, oh I can't even recall!   I cannot wait for tomorrow, but then again I don't want it to be over.  I am just so happy!  And tired, lol.  That is it, I have to sleep, no, SHOWER, and then sleep!  lol

Luv to all!  Brandon

This weekend was fun.  Friday night I did construction for the play (kinda loser-ish, I know, but I needed some hours put in!), Saturday I went driving!!! That night I went out with Danielle for a while, it was fun.  Sunday, did a whole lotta NOTHING, I did excercise though, which is good.  Then my dad took me driving all over the place.  I did almost hit one car... but I DIDNT!!!

Well that is about it, tomorrow will be interesting.

Well I got my driving permit today!!! woohoo!!!  And I turned in my job application at Monte's.  So maybe I will have a job soon, I'll just have to wait and see.

"event","Well today was good. Highlights:

-Second hour we disected worms, which was fun yet digusting.

-My feet killer hurt from my new flip-flops, but they were still kickin'.

-Forgot my pe clothes, but had a band lesson so i lucked out!

-Had tons of fun at play practice.

So yesterday I went with the family to the Fox Valley mall and such.  I ended up with three new shirts, a pair of shorts, new flip-flops, and sunglasses.  I think i did pretty good.  And besides getting new stuff, it was good to just get out of this town and spend some time doing something fun.  We should go more often, but that would prolly drive us to the poor house the way I shop! 

Well Wednesday is the band's Blue Man Group trip up to Chicago.  I am looking forward to it, but I have nothing to wear, lol.  Well thats about it, i luv ya's!

Well tonight was lots of fun.  I went for a walk with Danielle, then we went to the movies and saw ""Fever Pitch"".  It was good.  Then we went walking around to Jeremiah Joe's and stuff and found Nate, who joined us.  So then we went on a great soda hunt for Danielle.  lol  Then when Danielle finally had her damn soda we went back to JJ's for a while.  Then her and I walked home, and that is where I am now.  

Ugh, tomorrow is contest, woohoo!  (not really)

Oh well, I thought that I might not have won because honestly I had not practiced a whole lot and I did bad when I taped it.  So I challenged Yvonne back, so we will see who wins next week.  On a good note however, all my little solos that I play are now her responsibility for organizational.  Hahaha!

Well today, besides losing my challenge, wasn't bad for a change!  I got along well with everyone and didn't have much homework or anything!  

The play is coming along... SLOWLY!  But I think we will be fine, so everyone make sure to come and see it!!!  Well thats about it, bye for now.

Well today was odd.  I taped my challenge, and I think I won, but there's always that chance...  Then play practice was SO BORING!!!  So I left early with my mom and actually got to sit down and eat dinner!  Then I went to be tutored and randomly started laughing.  It was kinda embarrasing, but I couldn't help myself!  Maybe I am going insane or something, oh well...

I realized today that I don't have a lot of close friends.  I guess it is mostly my own fault, but I dunno.  Everytime I try to get closer to someone I either
A) Really piss them off
B) They really piss me off
C) Something that I tell them finds its way around to everyone

Is it supposed to be this hard to find a good friend?  Don't get angry you people that I am friends with, I honestly just don't feel like right now I have anyone that I could 100% call my best friend.  I don't think I really have had a best friend, except for one person, and she knows who she is.  Sadly we are not as close anymore.  

I do have a lot of wonderful people that I talk to all the time at school and here and there, but it doesn't go much beyond that.  I try to get out more, but it doesn't always happen.  I guess I just need to try harder.  We'll see.

Wow... That was really random, but I think I'll post it anyways, just because it took a long time to write this and I am interested to see if I get any comments.

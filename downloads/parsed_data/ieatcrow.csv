I have the right to not believe in that, as you have the right to believe in it and practice it freely. You and I were somewhat friends I guess until you found out that I didn't believe in God, and now you hate me? And make fun of me, and be a bitch to me? That is fine, atleast I have the respect to those who believe in religion, and I don't hate, or treat people that believe in God like shit. So how about you have the same respect for me.

"event","Hey everyone that reads this. Nothing much happened this weekend, nothing exciting at all really. I have been thinking about something a lot lately, and I think I'll share it with you. I've just been wondering, what is the point of life? Why are we here? I mean, I don't understand what humans are meant to do, what is our purpose? Fight and kill each other in pointless wars? Find love, and live happily ever after? I just don't understand what the fuck we do everything for? I guess these are questions that can never be answered or understood. I just don't understand what the point of anything we do is, I just don't get anything. And, maybe its just to try and be as happy as you can be. But really, look around, look at the world we are living in people. There is really much to be happy about, its a fucked up world, with fucked up people. People are murder, raped, beaten, abused, used, taken advantage of every hour of the day. I don't think a lot of people think about that, because it doesn't concern them..but if you take another look, you will see the fucked up world this is, and how fucked up everything is. So, if people are killed, what the fuck was their point? Nothing I guess. But why? I think people take their lives for granted, sure it has no point to what anybody can tell, but just please for this moment, think about how fucking lucky you are. That you aren't cut up in a fucking ditch, or you aren't being raped, or that you aren't living on the streets fucked up on drugs, and having no life at all. Don't take your life for granted, because its short, and fucked up. So live as much as you can. I'm done fucking rambling, later."

"event","It has been a few days since my last entry, so I will just tell you about the most important parts of the last few days. First off, Monday. Bleeding Through, Walls of Jericho, Martyr AD, It Dies Today, and Ignite the Will, played at the Legion, I wasn't suppose to attend this show, but Lacey presented my dad with an offer he couldn't resist, I had to get grounded for one extra week, seemed fair, so we took the deal. Anyways, on with the show. It was fucking amazing, although I didn't get to stay long enough to get to see Bleeding Through because I had to leave at 10. But the rest of the bands we fucking awesome. It was the best show I have been to in a long while. Jake might have broken his hand, and he suffered ""severe tissue damage"" as the doctor put it.

Alright, now with today. Lacey didn't go to school because she was feeling a little under the weather, so that kind of sucked. Other than that though, it was a pretty normal day. Sheila dyed her hair, and it looks superb. And well, thats about all that is new. Oh yeah, Jake's band got a new guitarist I guess, I want to hear them. Because I am willing to bet they rock, hxc."

Today, I saw Lacey in the morning when i came down the stairs, and we hung out for a little bit, and then went to class. The I saw Lacey again after first hour and walked with her until we reached my locker, then I hugged her and we parted ways. Before 4th hour, I saw her again, we briefly chatted, and then kissed and hugged, and went our seperate ways. NOW comes lunch time, Jake brought his brothers guitar again and we rocked out AGAIN. It was great, then, I was beating an apple, for whatever reason. It ruled. Back to Lacey, I saw her after lunch, we chatted for a moment and then we kissed and left. At the end of the day, I went to my locker, and then down to hers, and we walked to the buses. Now I am done, thank you. later."

So that gave everybody a good laugh. Then Jake introduced us to this awesome idea, you pushing on an apple for about a half an hour until its nice and soft, and then you fucking wail it at something. Well, I did this when I came home, and it was fucking funnier than shit. THEN at lunch we were talking about Dane Cook and that was funny as well. Lunch today, FUCKING rocked.

Lacey came to the game for awhile, and then went to the show. So I got to see her for awhile, and then when she left I hung out with Jake, Sheila, Bobby, and Caitlyn. Bobby let Jake punch him in the face for like 6 bucks, it was funnier then shit. Then everybody left expect for Caitlyn, so her and I were stuck with one another for the rest of the night. Which was okay, me and her became better friends. Saturday was awesome because my mother was nice to me and took me to co-op to get a cd. I got Remembering Never's album ""Women and Children Die First"". Its fucking amazing. Then Lacey came to my moms and we went to this fish fry thing at some lake and then she came back and hung out for a bit. And to conclude my weekend, today Lacey and I went to the movies and saw Without A Paddle, it was funny as hell. Well thats all fuckers."

We could live through these letters or forget it all together
See the months they don't matter it's the days I can't take
When the hours move to minutes and I'm seconds away

Just ask the question come untie the knot
Say you won't care Say you won't care
Retrace the steps as if we forgot
Say you won't care Say you won't care
Try to avoid it but there's not a doubt
And there's one thing I can do nothing about

When all that we need is just a reaction
It's too much to ask for when there's no attraction anymore
If chasing our dreams is just a distraction
I want to remember but I know that I can't go back

Just ask the question come untie the knot

I went to go and see Stefanie where I always do and Lacey was there today because she didn't have homework(I'm assuming that because thats really the only time she comes up there after school). I walked up and she was talking about some shit about falling, I don't know but I grabbed her elbow that was hurting..just to be funny so she hit me. Heres where I made a mistake..I walked away after that. And she left because ""I was being a prick"" what I did I am completly oblivious. So then I went down to the commons where I usually meet Lacey at, and her and Dougan were coming out of the commons and Lacey looked right at me and didn't stop to talk to me, she just kept going and as we walked outside she went and walked the other way with Dougan and didn't say shit to me. So I was like ""Fuck you then"". I don't know what the fuck I did wrong this time, but I was ""being a prick"" so fuck it. Maybe I'm just a worthless piece of shit that can't do anything good for anybody. Sorry Lacey. for ""being a prick"". I'll be sure and not go to my locker from now on."

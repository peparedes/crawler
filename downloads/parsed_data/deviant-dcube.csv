"event","i was having dinner with alyssa at BJ's cuz it was her friend's 21st bday and one of the people there is some filipino that looks like Chris Cabana! i didnt wanna be rude and assume if they were related or anything.. and i didnt wanna make it seem like all filipinos look the same!&nbsp; So like 30mins into the whole thing I finally asked him..

""is your last name Cabana by any chance?""

and he goes...

""as a matter of fact, it is!""

hahaha. i knew it! his name is Alfred and he is 2 years older than Chris! 

I didn't even know Chris had a brother. hahaha.

Which makes me wish I had a brother!! So that I can see myself in another body. hahaha. Or maybe not.. some brothers don't even look the same.

well there was 7 of us total.. me, alyssa, chris, jill, justin, cesar and maria. we left oxnard around 5:30pm, and we didnt get there till like 11pm or something. we stayed at the Embassy Suite. one bedroom with 2 full beds, and a living room with a pull-out sofa bed. the hotel was dope!! we hit up the indoor swimming pool and the jacuzzi right away..

we went on Highway 1 on the way home.. we pretty much lost 2 hours by driving there, but it was cool. had lunch at some cool ass restaurant right next to a creek in Big Sur. 

We saw a tow truck pulling out a car that went off the cliff !! Crazy shit yo! We had to pull over to watch it!! and the fuckin car was FUCKED UP! shieeet!

We had to go straight to Santa Monica cuz maria had an art show.. started at 6.. we got there after 8! hahaha. it was cool! ART KIDS are TIghT! and not those wannabe art kids either!

we had dinner at The Counter. it was pretty cool. we made our own burgers. mine was grilled chicken with bacon, lettuce, mayo, grilled pineapple in a wheat bun.. paid $9.50 for the damn thing, but it was worth it!

i pretty much got home at midnight!

"event","So i guess its time for an update.. i dont really go on this anymore.

- I got a job at Sony in the outlets! I've been there for only 3 weeks! I actually like it there! I work with Carrel and with Emery. Apparently he's the #1 warranty seller for 3 months straight! Shiieett son! I plan on beating him! We get commission on the warranties that we sell. Thats a pretty good motivation to do well at work. I think Carrel has over $150 on commission so far this month. I think I only have like $75 or something. It's really hard to get that number high since I think we only get like 6% or 10% commission on warranties. I'm trying my best. I'll try to catch up with him next month so it resets.

- hmmm what else? So yea I'm graduating this fall. Scary shit! I already applied at Harbor Freight as a Graphic Designer. I think they pay like $14 - $16 per hour. It just seems like the entry level position for Graphic Designers is around that area or $29,000 - $32,000. It looks a lot right now, but I know someday I cant live off of that. Web designers start at $45,000/yr. I'm actually going for that too! I'm really trying my best to be a jack of all trades. I also wanted to pursue Video editing and Film making, but I dont have time anymore. I just wanna graduate so I can work full time.

- In other news, my sister got the job as a manager at Target in Thousand Oaks. She's like the manager of the 4 floor managers in the store, and I believe there's 4 more managers above her. She's getting paid $52,000/yr now. Lucky biatch! haha. Thats pretty good considering she doesn't have retail experience at all. I guess that Masters in Business Administration paid off. That's a big jump from her $45k job at ITT Tech. Im happy for her. Hopefully she's gonna get a new car so she can give me her Celica!! harharhar!!

- In better news, Alyssa and I have reached our official ONE YeAR!! yayy!! And it's still going pretty strong too!!! Im happy! Happy as a duck! haha. We're planning on going on a bunch of trips this year. I think we're gonna go to a 2-day trip at Disneyland and California Adventures during spring break. Her friend might be getting in Hawaii this summer and we might go! That would be pretty cool (and expensive at the same time!) hahaha. 

- So all in all, life is fuckin awesome right now! I work almost 7 days a week, since I have 2 jobs (Sony and also at school). FUCK STATE PARKS! hahaha. I'M NOT GOING BACK! Shocking huh? I was there for 3 years!!&nbsp; 3 years too long!!!

LIFE IS GREAT. AWESOME GIRLFRIEND. AWESOME NEW JOB. 

-oh yea, I'm taking Life Drawing and we draw naked people in class. There's a guy who had 2 piercings on his nuts! He also has a MAn-gina! Disgusting shit!

Until next time."

oooh AppleOne just called me regarding my application as a Graphic designer. i told her that im still going full time at school, and she's still willing to work with me. i gotta double check my schedule and email it to her. she immediately asked me what i wanted as pay.. but good thing i was honest with her. she said the client is looking for someone full time, but flat out told her im not ready to stand on my own yet, and i was originally looking for an assistant graphic designer position.

<img src=""http://www.ireviewelectronics.com/images/dell-inspiron-e1705.jpg"">

- dell inspiron E1705
- 17inch widescreen
- intel core 2 duo (4MB/2.00GHz/667MHz)
- 2 gig ram (533 MHz)
- 256mb ATI Radeon (i should've gotten that geforce shit.. would've cost me like $200 more though)
- 80gig 7200RPM hard drive (which is cool with me, since i have a 250gig external harddrive)
- it'll also do an express upgrade to Windows Vista when it comes out in january!!! weeee!! no more Windows XP!
- weighs 7.9 lbs

its a pretty big investment on my part.. but it's worth it! i would've loved to own a 17-inch macbook pro, but with  what i was looking for, it would've cost over $3000 of a mac to equal what i have with my dell. but someday though, that macbook pro shall be mine!!!!!!! 

PC for now..

and he was fuckin standing next to me..

I didn't notice it at first when he came up over the counter at the pharmacy. The pharmacist asked for his last name and he spelled it out instead of saying it. 

B-U-S-E-Y is what I heard. The lady who was helping us looked at him and tells the other pharmacist ""his first name is Jake; his prescriptions are ready""..

and that was when it caught my ear! JAKE BUSEY! I looked at him and he looks meatier. hahaha. But he's fuckin tall though. He's probably like 6'3 or 6'4. He wasn't even dressed nice. I really wanted to talk to him but I didn't wanna be rude.

When he left, I came up to the pharmacist who helped him and told her that he was an actor. and I asked if I can get his home address! hahaha

Oh man! Apparently he's there all the time. I didn't know he lives in the area. Crazy shit!!"

<br />I have an UNPAID internship at <strong>James Graca Design Group</strong> in Oxnard Shores... emphasis on unpaid. haha. I figured I would do different internships every semester so I can pretty much get an idea on how it really is in the real world. It's only gonna be like 6 - 8 hours per week. It's not bad. I'm getting 3 units for school for this anyways. Ok I'm done. peace.<br /><br />Check out his design group's website. It's some pretty good shit. <br /><br /><strong>http://www.gracadesigngroup.com/</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;"

We're gonna leave on the 15th, and stay there until the 18th.

I asked Christelle if we could spend the night at her place on the 15th, and she said YES right away without having to think about it. That's wayy cool of her! CHristelle is awesome!

I booked a suite in SD for the 16th-18th. It's wayy cool cuz it has a king size bed and our own jacuzzi! fuck ya! hahaha. plus it's like 5 minutes away from sea world, the zoo, and other hot spots (sea cliffs, balboa park, ocean beach, gaslamp district, mission beach, etc.)... yay! i cant wait!! this would be a great way to end my awesome summer with my awesome girl!

ok quick updates..

And that only lasted for 23 days too! Now Chris is all jealous cuz we were supposed to take that class at csuci, but I backed out. muwahahah! NOw I can finally do shit! No more school work to think about!

I have 3 semesters left at CSUCI. I'll be done fall of 2007, and I'm walking at spring of 2008. I guess I'll be walking with most of my friends! weeeeeee!

I need to do a freakin internship, damnit! I'm almost done, and I really don't know what to do after! There are so many college graduates out there that don't have jobs. hmmm..

I totally forgot what to write after that last sentence.. maybe I'm just getting old.

You know you're old when you cant even play SKEEBALL anymore cuz your back starts to hurt! yup! That happened to me last year. hahaha. Ask Estevan.

I'm turning 22 this year! yet I still look like I'm 16 the most! hahaha.

I've been working out again. I work out at the gym at CSUCI cuz it's free! haha.

Jizel was there standing next to me when all of this happened, and I tried to keep my cool at first cuz I wanted to set a good example to the new employees. He came back for ROUND 2, and by that time the whole ""sorry sir"" and politeness were already so far gone.

- ""Are you even listening to me?!""

- ""I'm done with you!""

- ""..then you should know better!""

These were the things that I remember telling him. hahha. Jizel said he was cussing, which I dont remember. Well good thing he didn't cuss me out (like ""fuck you"") cuz I would have done the same thing to him. hahaha. Him and his wife were just ganging up on me. Oh well. At least I held my ground. I was gonna slam the window on him too, but he said something before I could do it.

hahhaha.

Good ol' state parks for ya!

And yea, as what Matt mentioned, some guy OD'ed on heroine. And 2 days before that some guy was freakin out from taking mushrooms and ecstasy! Oh I wonder why. haha

So that's a lesson for you kids! Drugs are a NO NO! You don't need drugs to have fun. hahah

or you don't have to listen to me. Do what you guys want to do with your life. 

** oh, and for people that I know that smoke weed, just ignore this message. hahaha. Cuz I heard weed isn't considered drugs anyways. ahha**

It's to honor faculty, staff, and students that excelled this year. the event is gonna be tomorrow at 6:30pm here on campus. this time, i'm seriously not expecting to win anything. but who knows...

we also moved!! well we're still in camarillo though! i know officially live on campus! hahaha. well not really ON campus.. but it's the housing next to the campus. it's pretty chill out here! i dont have to leave my house till 10mins before class starts! hahahah!

everything's great between alyssa and i! we're fuckin awesome! we just hit our official 2 months on the 14th of this month (i made it official with her on valentines day! awwww..) 

oh yea, i went to vegas for spring break. well only for 3 nites. i went with alyssa, jessica, chris j, brian, justin, ariel, billy and jill. yep all csuci kids! that was fun! i didnt gamble much cuz i got tired of security people asking me for my ID! hahaha. oh well! its gonna be like this for the next 10 years! haha

i'm officially with alyssa now. yay! we're still taking it slow. its too early for a serious relationship. i'm happy. she's happy. and that's all that matters. =)

i've been working on designs for carrel's band. so check out my myspace and the banners are there.

i'm taking web design class this sem, and i'm having so much fun with it. we were supposed to make a site for vegas. i'll upload it as soon as its semi-done.

i'm also applying for a web design internship in oxnard. the company is called MAC FAUCETS. so yea they sell faucets. how exciting. hahahaha but whatever

<b>but here's the big news.</b> a lot of people dont know this, but the house that we're currently living in is not really ours. we're just leasing it from this one guy. we've been here like 2 years i think. and now he's giving us 45 days to pack up our shit and leave. like wtf is that!? we've been in good terms with this dude, and he doesnt even have the balls to say this to us personally. he wrote this on a letter. what an ass! i think he's just pressuring us to buy the house already. but we're not going to though. my parents told me we need to start looking for a new place. i told my mom that we can move to the housing right by CSUCI. they're leasing 3 bedroom places for like $1600 i think. so that's not bad at all. i also suggested the area where marc martin lives. i dont know how much it costs, but it looks pricy. so we'll see. i'll keep this up to date.

"event","Yes... So something had happened to me and a friend of mine awhile ago now... we got jumped yeah he got hit in the head behind the ear with a metal bar or something then the guys proceeded and beat the shit out of me... I was stabbed and beaten yet un-fazed by the accident... My friend on the other hand was alright for a few days... then all of the sudden just stopped talking to me... whoa... I'm still trying to figure out why? Why is he mad at me? Does he think I planned it out so he could get hit in the head? Does he think I forced him to go? I'm totally confused... I didn't plan on getting us jumped... Did I plan for him to get hit in the head... did I plan on getting stabbed... was it like ""oh yeah I think I'll get stabbed today?"" No... I dunno... he ignores me... it's not gonna change the fact that I still have friends that are friends with him... If we all chill together then I'm bound to be near him and he ignores me... but not just me... Everyone just to avoid talking to me... I don't want him out of the group because he's trying to avoid me... *sigh* Fricken... Although it wasn't my fault I've already apologized but it didn't work so I dunno... just missing the good-olds again...

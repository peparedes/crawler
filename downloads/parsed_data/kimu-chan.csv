"event","Ok well I was wailing there all night online for Chelsey to get home, And as soon as she dose, She drops her backs and runs out of the room crying and iam not doing anythink i mean i did nothering wrong so iguess she ran away becasue I'am just really ugly and she just relized that now. So then I ran out of the room crying and flew away, But see what i wanted was just alittle small talk, like ""Why where you late.?"" then we would talk some more, then i would have told her the great news, becasue i had a surpirse for  her...But i guess i was just to ugly that she ran away from me and made me feel really badlly, I mean i wailted for her to come home for like forever, i talked to Jak online, He seems really close i hope we can become closer. And i also talked to Kai, Me and her made up so thats also cool. But last night is not what i wanted at all. EVen if she saw my name she could of asked, becasue my name was to her, i got so arousied eariler becasue i was so happy becasue i got her a gift. ANd i putthat in my name sayign that i wanted her love, and her sex, and i wanted it now, i mean who else would it be about. but anyway. She could of least asked, me first instead of running away like that and makeing me feel bad. So i guess you can say that i didnt get what i wanted last night. Becasue We didnt get to talk, i ddint get a chance to give her her gift and we didnt get a chance to make love...Last night was not what I wanted to happen...><"

"event","Well this is the second part of my day, See as soon as I was done posting in my LJ. My lover came online, and she called like usualler, but see then i found out that she was watching a moive a move that i thought we could wacth together. But i guess notm, I dont know, Iam not sayign that she is being selfish, but she has gotten alot things lately, she got her megaman game, posters to hang up on her wall. she got that moive, and the jacket. Omg what aim i saying I'am sorry that was worn i shouldnt be saying that she gose to work and then gose to school, and have to go home to deal wth those ass-holes. she should be getting alot of things she devers them. But maybe it's just that she dosent like to watch moives with me. thats what it looks like, but wenough about that it's not that big of a deal. But she after i got upset i told her to just go watch ti and surpriseing she did, i mean she wasnt soppuse to go she was suppose to stay with me. not accuttly go, but while she left me i went to sleep. and then my dad wakes me up and tells me to go outside.Iam like great so went outside, and went to the libaray. But o guess after that i had a better day. See after that two great things happen to me, One was i made a Falling Up cd for me and my lover, And the next is that i got to walk home in the rain. I like the rain it is so romiatic. and so wet,and everythink. Awww. Well thats it for now if anythink happens to nighjt i will post it."

"event","Currently: Very Upset. today was A bad day becasue first i got in trouble in first period. I put my head down on the desk for like a min and i get a lunch Detion. Then I have to carry around a big Text book, becasue as you can all tell my theacher is gay. No seriues i think she is gay..Well then i got in a fight with two black kids today becasue they walk around the school like they owned it,and i told them that i would kill them but i never did, dammit...>< All well, It's a bad habit of mine anyway..^^ Then i guess the rest of the day wasnt so bad. But lets fast forward to the fact why iam crying right now. Well first there is this kid named Kioko. He use to date my girlfriend, And he talked to me and he told me that he wasnt the one that called my lover a bitch. But i dont believe him, but he told me that he wasnt becasue the whole time they were together all they did was have sex.Now as soon as i heard this my heart broke. And tears fell on to the floor and i made a poulde where i sat. I'am still crying from it,. then i asked him if he still likes her, and still loves her, and i aslo asked he miss all the sex they had. but he wasing being really shady he woulldn't tell me at all. So I think he dose. and that also upsets me then we got in to how her friedns dont like me and how  he heard all the thinks that happen in the past, i dont know why no one can forget about the past and exccept that fact that me and my lver are so happy right now, we couldnt love each other more, and we havent been fighting at all. so we both made some changes, and we are happy now, But of course now one can see that every one just thinks that iam a bitch, whihc i proabbly iam..Well anyway we started talkign about that and i just as time went on i started to cry more and more, i mean this is really gonna hurt me forever, i mean i have like two thinks that are gonna hurt me forever and i will never foeget aboutnthem and they will hurt me no matter what. and the first one is my lover went to go see Pirates of the carbeain with her friends and her ssiter, and not wioth me, the second one is that iam always going to get this image in my mind of my lover have all this sex with this guy and it is gonna hurt, i havent even had time to talk to her about this, but i cant stop crying and i feel like my heart is broken. Well i dont know i willjust have to  talk to her about this but i know one thing she is never gonna talk to him at all. At least I hope not...><"

Gran: Michelle ah.. tonight eating?
Me: No not eating.

"event","I used to have this friend I considered my best one during my primary school days - let's call her XX. I believe she would know who I am referring to if she ever lay her eyes on this page.

Anyway, as it often is with foolish younglings, I ignored my family's advice to sever ties with her as we always hung out after school at playgrounds and eat plenty of Mamees and other tidbits instead of going home for dinner.

My granny would come to hunt me down nearby my school and I would be somewhere playing zero point with XX.

There were occasions where she revealed herself to be not-so-nice a person but I laughed and shrugged it off.

I remember she visited me at my house one day and since I was at home and being a primary school girl, I did not dress up nor make up. I mean, who does that?? It was just a girl friend visiting, right?
When I opened the door to let her in, her first reaction was to comment on  how disheveled I look :\ OK fine. Maybe I looked really woebegone.

Another time XX came to my granny's house (which is just 2 units away from mine), some of my relatives were at home. She saw the back of one of my aunt who was quite plump at that time - she has since lost a lot of weight - and XX simply gasped and covered her mouth in disbelief and looked at me wide eyed, as if she has never seen anything so obscene. It was plain rude of her to do that. She didn't even bother to hide her astonishment since she was a guest in MY granny's house! WTH.

I still remember all these because her actions stung (and stunk). Let's give her the benefit of the doubt then, and pretend that she was too young and insensible.

When she moved away - she used to stay at the opposite block from me - we drifted apart. But she invited me to her birthday party at a chalet years later. Since I regarded her and loved her deeply as a friend, I decided to attend the party even though I didn't know anyone there. I felt left out and left shortly after, I think.

She invited me to her wedding a couple of years ago via Facebook invite. Nothing wrong with FB invite, but there was no follow up/ whatsapp message and I was just one of the many random people being invited.

I do not hate her of course. In fact, I loved her very much. I am grateful for the many hours of adventures and laughter that we shared. This is something special that I will never forget, and I did enjoy her company immensely. It's just that I know better now, and therefore see my current circle of friends and ""friends"" in a whole new light.

This I firmly believe in; that people who come into our lives have a role to play and these experiences mould us into who we are to be."

Fast forward xx years later, her prophecy came true - for me at least. Though I like my man to be cheerful; J is far from a quiet mouse, but I have never fancied the drama king.

That is why I really appreciate J for his steadfast attitude towards building his career. Sure, he tells me a few things, about his frustration with <i>people </i>he faces at work sometimes, but he has never really complained about having to OT and he completes the extra last minute work delegated to him quietly.

He definitely has flaws, but I do admire this particular quality. Because men who keep whining about their jobs are a big turn-off.

Enough said."

"event","I am suffering from post NZ depression :( Really miss the mountain views!!
Woke up way before my alarm clock went off this morning and I couldn't go back to sleep. 

There are many beautiful places on earth I've visit / have not visit but NZ has a special spot in my heart for these reasons and more:

- NZ may have scorching weather days too, but it's still cool and air is rather dry. Not humid like SG where I start to perspire right away a shower. I hate that.

- Lovely mountain / lake views

- There are more sheep / cows / deers / birds than there are people in the countryside.

- The four seasons

- The adventurous and fun-loving streak and in Kiwis; skydiving, kayaking, bungee jumping, skiing, fishing, etc etc

-  The country is huge enough to drive hours to get to another place, yet small enough for exploration in every nook and cranny.

- You can go camping safely as compared to other beautiful yet dangerous places. No terrestrial snakes, no grizzly bears. It is wild, but safer than say Australia where it is home to venomous snakes/bugs.

- I have been to Europe for a short holiday and even though there are manyyyy other places there I have not set foot into, I have read and heard stories about scams and robbers tainting the image of these charming, remarkable countries. I have always felt safe in NZ, unlike how jittery I was in Paris because of pickpockets and thieves.

I can go on for a bit more, I think, but it's time to snap back to NOW and dream of my next holiday."

J and I went to buy his bow tie last weekend and the cute Korean salesgirl told me that she usually can differentiate between married couples and soon-to-be-married couples.

Me: How can you tell?
Korean: The soon to be married ladies are always so uptight and look stressed and anxious. But you are so relaxed!

I didn't actively try to be relaxed to show I am oh so cool. I didn't give much thought to it. But I am glad I am not uptight about matching colors and things like that. Too much to bother with and I just... heck.

I still eat what I want to and even though it is greedy and unhealthy, I... either do not have the determination to go on a diet or I don't really care too much. Or both. <i>But I know that I ought to shed a few pounds. Hehe..</i>

Sure, I enjoy certain to <i>certain </i>people. On occasions that I <i>choose </i>to put myself there, say in a Korean class or a ukulele class, I listen. To good speakers and teachers. Even though I put myself in tennis class months ahead, I didn't enjoy listening to my coach.

I am selective and stubborn. I certainly do not think I am above people, which is why I pay no heed to advices. It's just that I really don't like to take orders or abide by certain rules that makes no sense to me. Of course, I am forced to do things I don't agree with - we all are. And I do so grudgingly.

That does not bode well for me in the corporate world and this is one of the reason I struggle. I have been floating around and I never know what is the route ahead because... I don't plan.

"event","Estranged relationships.
I think everyone has experienced this. It's inevitable. Commonplace. 

Some may have bridged the gap, while others have burnt the bridges. Humans are bound to have conflicts, because people change over time. How do we co-exist peacefully? 

I finally bumped into MJ. I haven not seen her for months - ever since things blew out of proportions. Although I have been expressing distain towards MJ, I know that deep down inside, I am just being biased towards my uncle. Stories I heard are only from one side.
Not that I do not trust my sources, but relationships can become complicated and I am after all a bystander and I don't know the whole truth.

Could I have made things better by asking to chat with her, and understand what's on her mind? Surely there must be an explanation for her behavior? Or not? 
Would it have made things worse if I had dare to cross the boundary and speak the unspeakable?
There is too much at risk and I really don't want to make things worse.

When my cousins greeted me in unison, I said ""hello"" while stealing a glance at MJ. She was nonchalantly having a conversation with her son, determined not to make eye contact with me.
I felt no anger. Only a kind of sorrow that seems to get to me the way only family matters can.

I know we experience unhappiness so that we can better appreciate the goodness of joy. But it's always bitter medicine.
<i> Even if the bottle claims it'll make us stronger.</i>

I can only hope & pray for the strength to endure whatever may come our way."

I am going for my 3rd tightening session tomorrow.

I have been observing my teeth and found gaps in places never there before.
Isn't it just like life? Make a change and it will impact everything next to you. Sometimes I don't observe as much and the next time I look, the teeth have shifted slightly again.

Things will never be the same, and the only constant is change - I remind myself. It can be both good and bad. I will make it good."

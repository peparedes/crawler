Ashley,
     you've never read this because i've never written it in words for you. i wanted to write it in a public place so that not only you, but whoever would see it. this letter is not one of flattery or heartache, it is one of undistilled love. in this letter i want to thank you for all the things you've ever done for me and my struggle, not once have you ever turned your back or betrayed, and your love for me is unwavering. not many people can honestly say that they've found that special someone that they would want to spend thier life with, and in this letter, i express my gratitude for allowing me to find you. thank you, ashley, for being my best friend and girlfriend. this letter is a symbol of my nuetral love between you and me, that will always be with us. thank you for reading my letter. 

       I Love You More Than These Words Could Ever Say,
                              
                                  Kenney

We'll live on front porches and swing life away,
We'll get by just fine here on minimum wage.
If love is a labor, I'll slave 'til the end.
I won't cross these street until you hold my hand.
Swing Life Away."

PICES//ALMOST HOME
the sense of fear on which you feed
when the people cant believe the things they read
we've been brought up to be left out
eclipsed by the shadows of our doubts

the pieces rise and rearrange 
as the smiling faces seem so strange
with tactic symmetry and prose 
i feel the doors behind me close

you stand alone inside this crowd
faced the world and made us proud
but when the bitterness returns
theirs nothing left to hide the burns

"event","well, its official i am a nerd. today at my friends party, i went to play laser tag, some bastard kid got like seventeen hits off me (believe me, if you havent played it, thats a LOT). thus making me in tenth place, and that kid getting kicked really hard with my steel toed boots... happens everytime. haha. then i went to an arcade, wow, i got nine wins in a row. that was sweet. but still, pathetic. finally we went to my friends house, hahah, it only gets sadder, since like, eight, weve been playing dance dance revolution (ddr) nonstop.. it is now 12:25. i only have time to type this cuz its not my turn. haha. yea. its sad. i smell really bad right now, and i am going to the lake tommorow, so like, i have no clean clothes. sux. sorry ashley, i thought i would be home tommorow, but i dont think i am. this gay computer i am on doesnt have AIM, and i cant download, also... since i dont know shit about computers, i cant check my email. weakness. so just for now, i love you ashley, and i will talk to you later. and everyone else who finds time to read this... take my life, please.

"event","As we walk into the now moonlite night, he starts to walk faster, I quicken my pace to keep up with him.&nbsp; Soon he is almost at a trot, and I am a bit irratated that what started out as a nice walk has turned into some sort of game of tag.&nbsp; I shout at him to slow down and, he grabs my hand.

As soon as his fingers close around my hand, I feel a whisper of something, wind perhaps?&nbsp; But it feels like it is deep inside me, I feel myself yanked hard by the hand that he is holding, and he quickly pulls me along with him. 

""We don't have much time"" He states as we are moving faster and faster...

""Time for what"", I ask, my breath catching in my throat at the near run we are at."

"event","As we drive out of the city, neither of us speak a word.&nbsp; We just drive on in silence.&nbsp; I am an on the interstate not knowing where I am going.&nbsp; I turn to him and without even asking, he answers my question. ""We need to get away from all of the people and the city itself.&nbsp; It will make me more solid and able to explain myself better...&nbsp; I hope""

I remember an old park with some nice hiking trails from the summer, and head out in that direction.&nbsp; I think it will be far enough away from the city and people to suit his purposes.&nbsp; I think to myself, that I must be crazy, driving out into the middle of the night alone with some stranger.&nbsp; He even specifically asked not to be around people, I mean if you are crazy why let your victim know, and somehow I don't think that he bodes me any ill will.&nbsp; 

Trusting on my instrncts, at least what I hope are my instincts and not my hormones, I take the turn off to the park and pull into the parking lot.&nbsp; I realize the park is closed, but since it's so out of the way I am not thinking that it will be&nbsp; a problem.&nbsp; 

As I shut off the engine, he gets out of the car, and walks in the slight drizzle that has begun to fall, a stiff breeze is coursing through the air as I step out and walk towards him.&nbsp; He turns to face me, and my breath is taken away, with the way the rain is falling, gently dripping off his face, his hair damp but still somehow ordered.&nbsp; 

I curse as I realize that I am starting to get wet as well, and then realize that I didn't bring an umbrella.&nbsp;&nbsp; I look through the car, hoping that I might have left one in the past in here, and I more feel then hear him walk up behind me.&nbsp; He clears his throat gentle and I turn around. 

""You actually don't need the umbrella your looking for.&nbsp; Just think the rain away"", he states.

I am in a little bit of shock, and without thinking I think how nice it would be to be there with him in the park under a clear sky and in the moonlight.&nbsp; No sooner did I think that, then the rain began to stop and the clouds started to clear just in the area around us, allowing the cresent moon to shine down.

""So you still can use it, even if you don't know you have it."" He says under his breath, caught in a moment of introspection.

""Have what power, what are you talking about, and what are we doing out here anyways?""

He laughs and takes me hand and we walk out into the dark woods, seemingly immune to the rain falling around us...."

"event","As I walk into the bar, I say a few hellos to the regulars that I am well aquainted with.  As aquanted as you ever get when getting drunk in a bar.  Looking back, I've been drinking alot the past few years.  I tell myself I need to slow down, and focus on where my life is going.  I snap back, as I feel his hand on my shoulder, leading me to a booth in the back corner where we can sit with some privacy.

The waitress comes around and he orders me a glinlivet on the rocks, my favorite drink.  I look at him and quickly come to the point, ""What do you want from me?""

His eyes mist over, ""I've been exiled from my home for many many years, for something I did...  It's recently come to my attention that the winds have changed and there is a way for me to recover my lost status and place in my homeland.""

""I am not sure I can help you, it sounds like it's just politics and diplomacy..  Perhaps you should hire a lawyer."" I remark.

""You are uniquely able to help me, becuase of your bloodlines.  You are an ancestor of the person that I dishonored, many many years ago.""

I think back and not knowing much about my family history, I just give him a blank look.

He laughs again, ""As you probably noticed I am not like you, my history goes back thousands of years..  The ancestor I am talking about lived well over 2 thousand years ago, but yet her blood still runs very strong in your family.""

I sit very still, not sure what to beleive, but I figure what the hell.  I have been bored and rather dispondant at work, so I figure I will take the chance.

""I'll do it!"", I say... 

""Great, first we need to find somewhere outside the city so I can tell you more and help you understand your legacy..""  

Once more we get into my car and start the long drive out of the city."

"event","I find myself sitting and staring out my office window.  Watching the rain and lightning dance across the sky.  I can't seem to focus on the report that's sitting on the desk in front of me.  I think I see a flash of recognition in the clouds, and suddently my thoughts go crashing back to a drunken night 5 years ago.  All of a sudden it was just like it happened yesterday, and I remember it all very clearly, the smell and touch of his skin.  

I wrote it all off as just as a delusion, a product of a mind that feels too confined by the dreadful reports and paperwork that fill my normal life.  Until just now, a shape of cloud, a flash of lightning, and it all came crashing back into my mind.  A small gasp escapes my lips as that horrible and wonderful night suddenly is playing back in my mind.  My body responds, rock hard in my pants, my breath quick and heavy.  I try to get myself back under control, and force my mind to work on the work that's sitting in front of me, but I keep glancing back out the window, hopeing for one more look of that man that opened my eyes to a world that I never knew existed.

After about 15 minutes, I decide that I just can't work, between my random thoughts, my bodies unerring horrible timing of it's urges, and the constant crash of thunder, I pack up some things and head down to my car.  I figure I can get home, rest a bit, and perhaps work on the reports later that day.  I get into the crowded elevator, since it's near lunch time, and exchange the regular pleasentries that I always do with my co-workers.  People I see every day and talk too, without really ever getting to know.  After all the small hellos and how are yous are over, I turn and face the doors, waiting for the elevator to get to the parking garage and I can just get out of the office.  

We reach the lobby and everyone except me and a guy named Steve get out of the elevator.  We nod to each other, and head down beneath the ground to where our cars are parked.  He's polite enough to walk me to my car, and I thank him.  I listen as he walks off to his car, gets in, and starts it up, while looking for my keys.  I can't seem to find them where I left them, in my coat pocket.  Siliently cursing, I must have forgotten them upstairs, I head back to the elevators, when I hear from behind me, a low throaty,

 ""Are these yours?""

I freeze in my tracks, knowing that face, hearing the slight humor in it.  I slowly turn around, and he's standing there, the stranger from years ago.  I am speechless and just stand there staring with my eyes open, he's holding my keys but that doesn't seem to register how he got them.  He slowly saunters over to me, and I reach for my keys.  He holds them just out of reach, a slight taunt in his eyes.  

""You called agian, I had almost thought you had forgotten about me."" 

I stare at him, nothing has changed in his appearance at all, he's exactly the same as 5 years ago.  I start to talk and so many questions come flowing through my mind, I find myself stuttering.  I close my mouth, and my eyes, take a deep breath and compose myself.  

""Who are you, and why don't you look any different?  I mean 5 years isn't a long time, but there should be some differences?"", I inquire.

He laughs softly, ""We don't age like you do, but we do age...  And it's been a very long 5 years for me, with you on my mind.. Now, you dropped your keys, would you like them back?""

I narrow my eyes in suspicion, this was someone who had an unusual effect on me and I needed to know why.  5 years ago, I was more intimidated and scared, now I am more intrigued.   ""Give me my keys back."", I demand.

""First you need to do something for me.  A task that is needed to be done, and I think you have the knowledge and know-how to get it done.""

""I am not doing anything for you, first my keys"", I reply.

""Just hear me out, listen to what I have to say and then if you decide not to help, I will be out of your life forever.""

The thought of not seeing him again, is almost enough to break my heart.  But I will not allow my emotions to run this situation

""Give me my keys and I will listen.  Nothing more, no promises...""

""That's fair.."" He replys, and then unlocks my car door and gets in.   The thought of being so close to him, in such tight quarters, makes me quiver with anticipation...  I get in the car, and we head out of the garage, heading towards my local pub, at least there I will know the people and be safe, in case this guy is nuts..."

I glance over at the clock and notice it's only 6am, already the dreams that were plaguing me have begun to unravel in my mind.  I close my eyes again, but a feeling of dread falls over me the minute I close them.  I decide it's just as good a time as any to get up and try to shake off the aftereffects of the dreams.  I pick up the notebook next to me, and start to write, trying to capture what I could remember of what I just woke from, even tho it leaves me with a feeling of sickness and impending doom.  Nothing much seems to flow from the pen to paper, except a few choice words, which make no sense to me... ""Illusion, Shadala, and Seer""  Odd words for me to rememember, but of all the things I can clearly point too from the night before, that's what sticks."

The water feels so relaxing, I almost forget the events of the evening as the warm water cascades over my back.  I run my fingers across my chest, thinking of this stranger that has twice appeared to me.  I quickly jerk back in shock at remembering his sudden appearance and even worse his suddeen disappearance from my house.  I realize that it's not even in my realm of experience to have any idea what was going on, and just as quickly my brain decides to rationalize it and I come up with the idea I must have been more drunk then I thought and I imagined the whole thing.  My hands begin to trail down my body again, as I remember the way he smelled, the feel of his touch on my skin.  I realize for the past few minutes I have started to play with myself, and I quickly stop, flushed with the thought of this stranger.  I quickly dry off and tuck myself into my bed, for the first good night of sleep in a while, I hope..."

"event","As I finally made it home from the ""wild"" night out, I threw open the door to my house, and dropped my keys in shock.  The same man that had been at the bar was now standing in my living room.  I quickly grapped the nearest object at hand, luckly for me it was a pretty heavy piece of carved brass, I just happened to have on a pedistal near the doorway.  I scream at him, wondering what the hell he is doing in my house, and that infuriating smile crosses his face.  I throw the heavy object, before I think that would leave me defenseless, and I see the object pass right through his body.  

""I'm not exactly here"", he says.

I am taken aback, remembering his touch, his feeling, the way his body moved against mine, I slowly fall to my knees, all the emotion and feeling piling up on me finally over the evening.  He quickly walks over to me, but doesn't offer a hand or comfort.

""I just had to know where you went, who you were, where you lived.  You had just a strong effect on me as I did you.""

I slowly uncover my face, and with all the effort I could muster, begged him to just leave me alone.  To go and let me rest and get to bed.

""Please leave"", I implore.

Without any fanfare, not even the expected pop, the man kneeling at my side vanishes from view.  I carefully look around the room, to make sure he's gone, and then quickly get up and lock the door."

The wind hits me like a wall, I feel it's tendrils crawling all over my body, through my hair, finding the cracks in my clothing and caressing my skin like an old lover. 

I close my eyes and relish in the feeling, and then realizing where I was, I start to walk towards home.  I hear the door slam open behind me, and I can feel his gave on my retreating back, but I walk away still.  How dare he kiss me, how dare he make me feel vulnerable.  I don't need him, and I think I have made that point very clearly. 

Although there is a part of me that still misses what he just had to offer and it makes me wonder.  I can still smell his scent lingering slightly on my clothes, my body.  I draw in a deep breath, and mixed with the smell of the fresh rain and the smells of the city, I can still taste just the barest trace of his musk.  

I turn the corner and immediatly feel the releif of him staring at me.  My pace slows down so I can enjoy the night, without the constant pressure.  I try to center myself and in the heart of my being I know I haven't seen the last of this strange man."

""What the hell do you think your doing?"", I inquire.

He looks at me stunned and a little hurt, ""I'm just giving you what you've always wanted...""

""And what pray tell is that?  You whom I've just met, not even a kiss or anything, but you bite me?"" 

I try and channel my anger at him, to overcome my want..  No need to go over and hug him. The look of embarassment and hurt on his face almost too much for my poor heart..

""I apologize if I overstepped my bounds.  I thought you knew more, when you called me.""

""I have no idea what your talking about?  Your some stranger in a bar, who happened to sit down next to me..."" I implore, almost sounding whiney..  I strive to compose myself better, in the face of this unknown.

I take two quick steps and before I have a chance to react, he has wrapped me in arms, far stronger then I think they should be, and his lips are pressed to mine.  I don't think my eyes could get any bigger then they already were, but the minute I feel him breathing into my mouth, the quick dart of his tongue against my teeth, it's as if his breath, his body, his soul is melting into mine.  I lose track of who is who, and what is where.  It feels as if his intire body is all around me, surrounding me, infusing me."

I must have looked like a fish out of water, becuase he once again let loose that low chuckle of his.  Just to prove him wrong, I took the lead, and pressed my body back against him, letting it move to the rhythm of the music.  

The second my body began to move against him, his chuckle was cut off.  A sly smile spread across my face, so your just as strongly effected by me as I am by you, but that was the last thought I had, as we moved across the dance floor. 

It seemed we just flowed with each other, slipping between other wildly gyrating bodies, never seeming to touch anyone else but each other, on the packed dance floor.  I was really getting a work out, I could feel his breath hot on my neck, before I realized it, his lips were pressed to my neck, just below my jawline and I could feel his teeth, just gently scraping against my skin...."

Who is this stranger that is before me and has captivated me so entirely.  ""Who the hell are you?"" escapes my lips at last.  The trace of anger still giving me some strength to resist this man before me. He extends a hand to me, I hesitantly take it..  ""My name is Seb..  Who am I?  That question is much harder to answer, but I think you might have an idea""

I look hard at him, not knowing what to make of him at this point, I shake my head, ""I don't think we have ever met, and I don't recognize the name at all.""

I could actually feel them burning in my brain.  It made me wonder what secrets he was ripping out of the most hidden recesses of my mind.  I opened my mouth to speak to say something, but nothing seemed to come out.  Everthing I thought seemed to trivial and stupid with him gazing at me so intently.

"event","What I remember of the house.  When you walked up to the house, you came up to a stairwell outside.  You could go down the stairs into an area, lower then the parking area, almost like a moat.  Or you could go straight across a bridge into the main doorway.  If you went through the main set of double doors, you entered onto a landing with a staircase going down or you could branch off to the left or right. (I think the bedrooms) ,down the stairways, you entered a large living room area..  The kitchen would be to your left, and another set of doors outside (To the moat like area) are on your right.  The kitchen area was very open with an island, a grand room style room, so the living room and kitchen connected.  If yo uwent to the left and entered the kitchen (Around the island), there was a sliding glass door, that let out into a sun room.  The sun room was enclosed, but there was a swining door to the right, and another sliding door to the left.  Out to the right would be a small dirt road and quite a bit of land, well manicured.  Looking straight out of the room, you looked at a mountain peak that looked like it had an cable tram on top that run across the ridge, out over the house (Since the house was set into a ridge as well), made a left and headed out towards some mountain peaks to the left off in the distance.

So if you went out the left door, you were on a path, that led over to a national hiking path, or could just enjoy the beauty.  I think it faced west since I remember the sun setting behind the peaks over in the distance. 

As the sun set, I realized that all the tram towers were lit with lights, and you could see off in the distance the cars crawling along the mountain roads..."

Wild frenzied gyrations.

But I figure I will give it a try, I mean even if it just stops being entertaining and I stop doing it who will know?  I certainly am not telling my friends this exists, dear god what if I wrote something in here about them?  There are some thoughts that should just be kept to yourself. 

How odd that I would think a telepathic world would be so kewl, and yet I keep things to myself.  LOL Oh-well, it's sometimes better that my friends only get a small glimpse into my world and the way I think.  I think it would drive most of them insane.  Hey, reminds me of a movie called In The Mouth of Madness.  Except it's my mind that's doing the crazies, not the book.

Then again, who's to say I even have to talk about friends in here, it could be all about me.  Although really I'm not all that interesting, it's usually what's going on in my life that is, and that means my friends.  So many decisions to make, so many things to not write.  

Oh-well, we will see how this whole thing goes."

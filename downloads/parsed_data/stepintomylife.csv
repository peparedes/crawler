"event","thanksgiving was a success there wasn't a whole lot of family members such as my grandma which made it wonderful, although i was quite disappointed when my grandma Betty couldn't come out due to the snow and I missed her terribly but oh well the previous night I stayed up all night talking to someone it was crazy I never done that before and it felt sorta important and always I disgust myself on how much I'm online 11:30-till 7 in the morning...hm do people do that? exaclty they don't ha Anna and Sara came over Wednesday and we did nothing but acted like the complete skanks that we are haha I love those girls we watched Disney movies all night and drank hot cocoa on the biggest party night of the year :-) well my mom got surgery this morning and when they came home my mom was so nice and my dad was like an ass to me because I told him I needed a ride to my basketball tounament later on and I was sleeping over a girls house from the team and we were gonna make shirts..I'm sorry I ask once in a great while to have a ride somewhere or ask for money, I never ask for money and when I do they don't have it but in all reality they don't wanna give it to me and my tabs with my friends are crazy I'm defintaley up to $500 dollars each from Anna and Sara, but their such sweethearts they don't bitch about it all the time-eh I'll jus pay for their weddings ha this morning a lady was spinning the wheel on price is right and she fell haha it was hilarious I can't help it but when people fall its the funniest thing to me ever, especially if I fall-so I wish I had a life instead of people falling..

"event","so ever since I got this thing back I havent really been reflecting on my emotions and stuff like I used to, maybe because before I went to far with it and people were like blah blah..ya thats what they said but I just have so many things in my life that I keep to myself and wondering if someday I will truly be understood for who I am and what I have to offer, but I'm always just pushed away from everyone, it's like I can either try my hardest to make someone laugh or I can be a complete annoying bitch, thats who've I become and I haven't seen the person I used to be in quite some time now, this year has been complete hell, starting with the summer, for once after the big drama break up I thought things were going great, I actually wanted to get to know someone and care about them, but of course nothing ever works out and its not like im not over it cause I am, and that would be creepy if I wasn't, but sometimes it crosses my mind, I'm wondering who I am, and when will I truly be happy and ...well nice, if I didn't have my friends with me I really don't know what I would do, I can tell it's not easy to be friends with me, because I go through so much self-drama that I can't even stand myself sometimes 

so this year being hell and all ya..nobody in school is good, I miss when my sister was a senior, freshman year was the best year I ever had, all of my friends were together and it's like now theres this constant battle of who I should be friends with and who I shouldn't be, it's not that I don't wanna be friends with this one person it's just I never feel like I can fully trust them, should I just let things go and pretend I don't know what's being said about me all the time -no I used to that and I'm never going back to that, kinda like I don't think I'm ever gonna go back to the way I used to be, when I was happy and confident of myself, it's seems like everyday that goes by it gets worse and worse, I'm always in this constant battle to change myself inside and out, primarly the reason I dyed my hair red, but it's fading back thank god ha but I just craved a change in my life, wanting to be the person I'm not and most likely never will be in English were reading this book the Catcher in the Rye and for some odd reason I find myself relating to Holden, it's really creepy minus the craving for sex and complaining about people picking their pimples but seriously I feel as lonesome as he does, and how someone he's craving relationships but yah..and

I'm really not using this livejournal to catch attention from anybody, nobody is sitting down forcing you to read me bitch about my life, its your choice, but this is the closest thing I have to a person to spill my guts to, besides Anna and Ally their like my diaries that talk back but sometimes I just feel like I can't lay all my problems on them every waking moment of my life because if I had to hear me 24/7 like they did i'd kick my ass

so speaking of kicking asses, I had a basketball scrimage today and I got the ball and I'm like oh cool I have the ball and this crazy girl grunts and pushes me so hard that my chubby body knocks over and falls dramatically onto the bleachers, god that killed, I just like sat there holding myself back from running up to her blonde ass and punching her in the face, that I crave to do everyday of my life when people piss me off but I just kept going on with the ""fantastic game"" yah did I mention I like dove to get the ball and I skidded my body across the floor for like what seems like 5 minutes ha, pretty funny, then I punched Nicole Wimmer so hard because someone told me to haha Nicole I love you ;-)

so this brings me to the end of my day and my constant fear of running into someone at school that I can't even get the nerve to take myself out of advisement anymore, not the way it should be, but when your constantly getting told something over and over again they overpower you and get you for the best and I'm just saying this it better stop soon

your free to leave a comment of question or whatever you want- but I'm not sitting here expecting one

so pretty much my life has been very dramatic, me and my friends are going through some rocky times and I don't even care..and its sad because I wanna care but I'm so upset at all of it that I'm done and I don't wanna get hurt about it, it's just I tried so hard at one point to be a good friend and I was turned into a doormat, but whatever shit happens if we are good friends somehow it will all work out

I'm wishing it was summer, I'd change everything that I messed up with *him* and it's pathetic how hung up I still am about it and I know some parts of me wants to be with him and some parts just want to hang back and calm down about it 

well thats enough drama for my first entry in awhile :-)

"event","Alyssa I know you have been through alot with things, and ur sick of everything but the last thing I would do is backstab one of my friends, yeah we all have our differences but you have to believe me when I say this...I'm telling the truth and nothing anyone can ever say can prove that, except for ur trust in me and I promise I didn't do anything, remember it was yesterday we were talkin bout how much we missed each other and how were gonna try to hang out and were always gonna be Romey and Michelle, why would I mess that up? why would I say things I don't mean? I'm not like that Alyssa, and it hurts me to think u can look at me like that, I'm your friend and I will always be here for all of my friends, so please let's be friends again, I love you and I'm sorry I know you don't like when people write things about you, but I thought this way you could think about things instead of just talking to me...remember when we first became friends I LIKE IAN MORE, I love you I really do...please ""you'll always be my baby""
 ps I wouldnt be writing this if I did backstab you or I didn't care about you..
Romey and Michelle no matter what

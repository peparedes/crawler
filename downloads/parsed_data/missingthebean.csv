It is hard to express in words the lives she touched and the happiness she brought to everyone who knew her. Melanie was the most beautiful shining light and will be forever with us. Thank you for all of your love and thoughtfulness.

"event","After 62 days in the hospital I finally got to go home. Well actually, I already am home. I've spent three nights sleeping in our new house, and with the aid of sleeping pills I manage some decent sleep. It's so good to be home! Although I can spend the majority of my time at my own whim now, I do still need to check in with the hospital every other day for blood tests and whathaveyou. My immune system is at it's lowest once again from my last chemo regime, but the difference this time is I don't have any infections. If I can stay away from infections for the next few weeks, then I can have the rest of the time before my bone marrow biopsy to myself and family. Which is great, since my mom is here!! She just arrived a few days ago. It's so great to have her around, and along with my sister being here it just feels amazing. And then Brian's mom gets here in a week as well! Lots to plan and look forward to to keep spirits up and getting back in shape. I lost 6k (13lb) and a lot of muscle while in the hospital, so now is my time to work on getting fitter and healthier.

Thank you for your continued support, and keep me in your thoughts while the chemo does it's job these next 2 weeks.

"event","Hi everyone, I have been updating my personal blog, but not this one for some time, and although most of you have heard through family or other ways, I figured I should post it on here as well. 

I have been in the Wellington Hospital since last Tuesday fighting a high fever, possibly caused by a bug or by my leukemia relapsing. I have been on antibiotics since then which do seem to be helping. I also had a bone marrow biopsy to confirm that indeed the leukemia was back and a course of chemotherapy was scheduled in preparation for a bone marrow transplant to come in a few months, once a donor and everything is secure. 

Right now I am on my 10th day in hospital (a record stay me!) but luckily I have been able to leave for some wheelchair accesorized walks around the hospital with Brian and Linda and then also I have had to few hours of trips home during the afternoon between chemo. So I have seen a bit of air in between these past 10 days.

I don't know much of the status of this all, communication with me has been low, but the goal is to get me back in remission through this week of high dose chemo, and then keep me in remission until I get the transplant. There are scary statistics that I try not to look at surrounding these things, so I am just hoping for the best and doing what I need to do.

Family and people far off, will be happy to know that I have a large support network here including my sister, Linda here for a year with her Kiwi partner, and a good friend from Philadelphia also here for a year, helping to support Brian and I. This doesn't include all the other friends popping out of the woodwork to help with meals and visits and even just hellos. I am feeling really supported and loved, and that's important at this stage for me, so I don't want you guys at home to worry. Just keep sending your healing thoughts, hugs & kisses and positive vibes my way, and I'll get them.  

I love you all, and will update this again as soon as I have anymore information. For now I am in hospital receiving chemo for about 4 more days. Brian seems to be doing well. He's been working away at packing up our house, since we're due to move next week, and tucking his head in to work as normally. Of course he is great at helping me and I'd be lost without him. He could definitely use some directed energies and vibes too I think :)"

We had a launch party, 2 elections that I got to vote in, a smattering of dinners and lunches, a brainstorming morning, successful shopping and a lot more that feels like it happened months ago. It's amazing how time starts to speed up.

We're now beginning to plan what to do for the holidays. New Zealand pretty much shuts down in January and everyone is expected to relax and enjoy the nice weather. We're thinking a trip to the Coromandel for some camping and site seeing, since the last time we were there with my mom it rained the whole time. We are also very tempted to get out of NZ and check out Aussie or Raro. But we might save that for later next year. We need to sell some <a href=""http://www.nzimmigrationdvd.com/"">DVDs</a> first!"

"event","Last night was the launch party for <a href=""http://www.nzimmigrationdvd.com/"">Go New Zealand: The Immigration and Settlement DVD</a> that Brian and I have been working on for the past year. It was great to see everyone and celebrate our huge accomplishment!

I never remember how much I've let on about it on here, but we have spent the last year traveling, filming, interviewing, editing & producing this DVD. It started out as a side project and turned into something so much bigger than we ever could have expected, with lots of people involved. 

Go New Zealand is a 2 disc DVD set that provides all the information you need in making the decision if moving to New Zealand is right for you. We made this DVD because it's something we were looking for when we were deciding to move to New Zealand, but didn't exist. We have information about New Zealand, visas, education, healthcare, employment & more, and interviews with immigrants and New Zealand experts talking on all these subjects. If you ever wondered why we moved here, just watch the DVD and find out!

We're retailing the DVD internationally through our website <a href=""http://www.nzimmigrationdvd.com/"">www.nzimmigrationdvd.com</a> and will be selling it wholesale in and out of New Zealand as well. We are really proud of what we have accomplished and hope you will help us make it a big success by spreading the word about it. Here's a preview video of the DVD:

"event","It's interesting how your taste buds change overtime. I used to hate spinach, while the rest of my family loves it. As a kid I used to detest seeing the green globby mess plopped on a plate. Now I can't eat enough of the stuff in salads, spinach lasagna, quiches, and so forth. I also hated the taste of seaweed, so I could never eat sushi. Now I love it! Making vege sushi at home is easy, healthy and fun. And it's so pretty!

<img border=""1"" src=""http://radke.ws/melanie/BLOG/2008/SEPT/sushi.jpg"" /> 

I'm also obsessed with wasabi, which was weird to discover since I'm normally am not a fan of spicy things. Wasabi is different in that it's a bright huge flame at first and then goes out really quickly. None of this lingering and compiling spice that I can't handle. 

 I think retrying foods you used to not like, could result in a new favorite food. I encourage everyone to try!

(In other cooking news I've been trying to make the perfect pumpkin scone, 2 attempts in and I'm still not satisfied. I've also found a great recipe for vegan chocolate cake, which calls for almond milk.  I don't think it's tasty enough to warrant it's $6.70 price tag, so will try the recipe again without it.)"

Over the weekend Brian and I drove up to Levin and spent some time at a <a href=""http://www.shado-lans.co.nz/"">pet quarantine facility</a> filming for the DVD project. The husband and wife that own the place are so friendly and live a life very similar to what Brian and I imagine for ourselves, amongst animals and the outdoors. It was lovely standing in the sun by the sheep run, looking out over acres of green talking about life.

On the way back we stopped at the <a href=""http://www.trashpalace.co.nz/"">trash palace</a> in Porirua where I got a bunch of pots and cups for only $5! I'm trying to get a bunch of potting containers together to plant a deck garden. I don't want to buy anything new or plastic so this was perfect.

It's awesome. And makes me feel like this blog is inadequate. It made me want to post and talk about all the non exciting things we have been doing lately. But, I guess there have been some exciting things.

We are making great headway on the DVD project. All components have been touched, and some are nearly done (filming, editing, website, DVD packaging- not done, but touched :) We've got lots of interviews and filming scheduled for this week and next, including 2 government departments, one university and a few immigrants.

I went to wine tasting with the <a href=""http://www.awn.co.nz/"">American Womens Network</a> over the weekend. I enjoyed just the right amount of delicious New Zealand wine and learned a bunch to boot. A highlight was the dessert wine infused with ""Christmas cake spices."" 

It's been raining for the past few days, which has been a great excuse to stay inside and read, listen to audio books and cuddle with the cat. I am currently enjoying an autobiography by a recently introduced friend <a href=""http://bornonthecontinent.com/"">Getrude Matshe</a> and Dr Andrew Weil's ""Meditation for Optimum Health.""

I have also been enjoying cooking lately, including pumpkin scones (might need to retry this), chickpea burgers, my own juice combos with a borrowed juicer from a friend and fresh fruits,  and a collaboration between Brian and I produced a delicious vegetarian chili last night. Still a long list of new recipes left to try. I'm all about recipes with ""Christmas cake spices.""

Well I'm sure there is more I can ramble on about, but you are probably bored by now, and I will save somethings for next time.

Hardly any of you comment! Please do! Let us know you're reading, ask us questions, tell us what you like and don't like and fill us in on what you have been doing. I know some may not feel comfortable with other people reading what they have written, so from now on I will screen all comments. That means we can read them, but no one else can- that way you have no excuse!

There are still some things to be done before our departure, but overall I feel we are in a good place and we both are really starting to get excited! Extending our trip is looking doubtful after several attempts already, but I am holding out hope. We already have plans for a few days of the trip which should be lots of fun. Yesterday I booked a 6:30am yoga class then breakfast and massage at a spa in Waikiki. It's not the yoga retreat I'd like to go on, but it's close and should be pretty inspiring (but I forgot how expensive the US can be-and tax isn't included in the quoted price! How quickly I forget!) Not sure how often we'll be able to get online while traveling, but I will post updates and pictures of our trip as soon as I can.

I will keep updating this schedule as things change. We are very excited!!! and in the process of getting everything sorted before we leave. See you all soon!"

"event","Here in NZ it is just a few hours away from the month of May. I can not believe how fast time flies. Although sometimes during my treatment time seemed to stand still, looking back I can't believe it has been nearly a year since I was diagnosed with Leukemia. I can not believe it. Me. Melanie. Getting through treatment for cancer at 25. Remembering that I celebrated that quarter of a century mark in the ER getting a blood transfusion. But I am putting that all behind me.

It has been a few weeks since the main part of my treatment ended. My Hickman line is out, I've played some volleyball and gone to some yoga classes, but it's far from all over. I spent hours on Monday night vomiting and had another visit to the ER. I've spent the last week or so feeling nauseous and utterly drained. This is harder than I thought! The other stuff was expected to be hard. This, the end bit was supposed to be easy! Back to normal as the doctors said. But taking so many pills every day (including oral chemotherapy) is not normal. Maybe I need a dosage adjustment, maybe I need time for my body to adjust, but it does take its toll. It is hard, and I am fighting.

But I know I can do this. With all your support I will get through. I am so excited to come home and see all of you that I love so much. I am so excited that I (think I have) convinced Brian that we need to stay longer then we originally planned. Hopefully I can spend extra time giving you all hugs!"

The ending of my treatment was sort of anticlimactic once I realised that I would still be in and out of the hospital at least 2 times a week for blood tests, checkups and lumbar punctures. I know it will become less frequent, but right now things don't seem too much different. I am taking up to 15 pills a day and feeling really tired. BUT I do feel a lot healthier and happier and have been getting out and about :)

Last weekend we drove up to Taupo for a long weekend of filming for DVD project which turned into early nights and mornings and enjoyment of beautiful weather.

They make the best of years in treatment, or are worried by thoughts of reoccurrence for years afterwards. Although there is always a chance that my cancer will come back (a high 50% chance if I believed in statistics) I do believe that this is it for me. I believe I am cured, I have cheated death as someone said today. 

I have learned many lessons that have changed my life. I have grown closer to my family, to Brian and his family. I have made new, lifelong friends. I have felt the touch of so many people on my life and I am forever indebted to them for it. I believe I am a better person because of it. I'm grateful for this experience because of all that it has brought me. Don't get me wrong it has been a hard hard journey, that isn't over yet. But I can see the good in it. And I believe it happened for a reason. 

But I am glad that it is nearly over. 2 more days. I try to stay in the present, but can't help but think about the future. And it looks really bright."

Brian and I will be spending a few days in Hawaii before we make our way to the east coast, but will probably arrive around June 24 and leave around July 7 (I still have to book our LA-PHL flights.) This time will be split between PA and NJ, not totally sure on exact dates yet, but it would be lovely to see everyone! We're thinking of having a 4th of July party in NJ and then a going away party in PA that weekend before we leave. So excited to see everyone- hope you'll be around!"

"event","all our traveling updates, I figure I should give a cancer update too.

I only have about about 1-2 months of treatment left! That includes 2 weeks recovering inbetween chemotherapy and some time after my last treatment to recover and have my Hickman line removed. I am very excited I am so close to the end. By then it will have been nearly a year (around 10 months) that I have been going through this. Once my intensive treatment is over I will still have about 18 months of ""maintenance"" treatment which involves hospital visits, chemo injections, blood tests & medication. BUT it doesn't sound bad at all after what I have already been through. 

As you probably already know I have been in remission since my second month of treatment, but leukemia comes back easily and so everything I have done since then has been to prevent that from happening. There is of course still the chance that it will come back, but I will worry about that if and when that happens. In the meantime I am looking forward to being able to swim and take baths again, travel and visit all our friends and family in the US (planning for June 2008!) and getting back into volleyball, horse riding and just enjoying an active life again. 

Thank you for all your support to this point, it has been an amazing help in my mental & physical recovery and I am grateful every day to have such supportive family and friends.

We were pretty disappointed with Nelson after hearing lots of people rave about it, and with the weather catching up to us again we did a quick tour and then made our way back to Picton.

On the way we came across this amazing spot below a bridge. The water was crystal clear and people were jumping off rocks, swimming, sunbathing- it was beautiful. I would have been in that water in a second if I could have (I'm not allowed to be submerged in water due to my Hickman line :(

In Picton we had a nice dinner at the same seafood restaurant we went to the last time we were there and then hopped on the 7pm ferry. The weather was horrible and the ferry was delayed, we didn't get home till 11pm. Thankfully we had taken some great anti-nausea medication or we would definitely have been sick on the boat.
</lj-cut>

Overall it was a great whirlwind trip. We covered a lot of ground, and even though it might not have been as relaxing as I would have liked, we accomplished most of what we went down there for. I was really impressed with Christchurch, and look forward to spending more time there, and checking out some of the other spots that we missed."

Day 1: We flew into Christchurch early Friday morning and had a sunny, hot day of wandering around and filming in the city. We loved Christchurch! It was much bigger than we thought, and we were happy to see lots of old character buildings that reminded us of Philadelphia. We also drove out to Lyttleton Harbour, then Sumners Beach. On our way back into Christchurch we drove through the Port Hills, but by then it was getting really windy, cool and rainy. We were exhausted by the time we got back, so after dinner we crashed at our hotel for the night.

"event","One of the best things about IFIX is all the people we get to meet. Yesterday we spent the afternoon/evening in Plimmerton at a customers ""retreat."" He lives in an amazing house set on 5 acres of bush with little tracks winding through gardens, olive trees and grape vines. He has quails that run into his office and Tui's that drink out of cups. It was an amazing day and I can't wait to go back.

Taffy takes amazing photos on his property and abroad, and just had a book printed about Tommy the Tui. We'll be using some his photos on our DVD and website."

On Jan 5 Brian and I went out to sea with our friend Oliver and 12 other people to go fishing for Kingfish (apparently according to Wikipedia aka <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowtail_amberjack"">yellowtail amberjack.</a>) I was a little weary about going for 3 reasons. one. My legs were still not fully functional and I was unsure if I could maneuver around the boat. two. The last time I was out deep sea fishing was eight or nine years ago and I spent the whole time curled up in a ball feeling like death. three. Kingfish are HUGE. The smaller ones weighing 50-60 pounds!

I was also a little disheartened (who's kidding, a lot disheartened) when our captain was giving us some information before we set off and amongst other things said that Kingfish are near impossible to reel in, and that we were going out to rough seas and if you got seasick easily you should step off the boat immediately. 

Hrmmmm. 

I decided to have a go anyways. 
And it worked out.

I had gotten some prescription seasickness pills beforehand and they worked like a charm (or I just don't get seasick anymore, but we'll never know) I wasn't able to walk around the boat much, but there were plenty of railings for me to hold onto so standing was no problem. I was scared to try fishing at first because of how much the boat was rocking (I didn't want to fall over the edge!) but I found a way I could still hold on and fish at the same time. AND I caught 3 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahawai"">Kahawai.</a> They weren't as big as Kingfish, but still the biggest fish I ever caught at between 1-2 feet long. There wasn't that many fish caught (by the 14 males on board), so I was pretty excited to have caught 3. I also saw a shark and a barracuda. 

All the meat was divided up amongst who wanted it once we got back, and I used our portion to make a Kahawai (tastes like Snapper) coconut curry. It was tasty.

This was the only guy that caught a Kingfish, and he caught 2! (that's one of them BTW)

This is how I had to fish, with one hand holding on for dear life.

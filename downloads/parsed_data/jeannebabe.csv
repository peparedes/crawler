2005 is gonna be awesome---with only 5 months left of 8th grade :), :(!

Ooh. I saw Phantom of the Opera yesterday and it was SOOOO good! It brought back Chorus memories...I sang with all the songs! : P

I got a funky haircut the day before...it's kinda short! ohh well...I'll live.

I'm still in Laguna...most likely I'll come home tomorrow because the weather is bad for driving today and Sunday! 

Well it's raining now and it's COLD!

Besides Phantom, I've seen Ocean's 12 (for the 3rd time), and saw on DVD (again) Legally Blonde, Selena, Save the Last Dance, Moulin Rouge, Camp, and The Italian Job. Impressive huh?

well I need something hot....I'm FREEZING!

Tomorrow will be a bittersweet day. Bitter because I won't get the chance to talk to my friends in person really at all, or see them :(...(including hedgie!) and we have a science mini-quiz. Sweet because it's our last day of school before break and YAY the sing-a-long, gift exchange, student council skit (which i HOPE will go well), and lots of other stuff! yay

Well I'm going to go off and study the Periodic Table of Elements for my mini-quiz and then I'll wrap some presents, talk to people except one person who I refuse to speak too! yay :)

so they ask me: ""what do you want for xmas"" and I say ""haha a bf"". they say, ""wow I don't think you're they guy who you like's type."" they went on about me not being the guy's type. 
i started to cry, because i have such a stressed life that the fact of liking a guy is my only ""fun"" thing right now....and i can't believe it...it's basically ruined!

"event","ouch...my head hurts. it's hurt from 740 this morning...I'll explain

when I got to school, I walked in with Alyssa, and went pretty much immediately to the locker room where Kirsten and Cody were. Clare brought in this awesome magnetic dart board which we were playing with. I was sitting on the heater with Alyssa, Kirsten throws the dart, and it hit me in the head!!!! haha well I had a headache for the rest of my day. then savannah asked me to sub for her Escorting. haha she paid me a quarter for it! WOOT! haha so I escorted for a while, had fun with that, and then went in to Chapel where we sang our NOEL! that was fun! especially the latin group! haha HIAY HIAY HIAY! haha. We had a quiz in math class :( oh well I think I did alright. and most of the other periods were just boring. Except for PUBLICATIONS again! haha this time it was Julianna, Julie, Kathryn, and I. We took pictures and were ""pimpin'"" our bball uniforms! hahah! Mr Minich walks through the door and Julianna SCREAMS! hahahahaha we fell down laughing so hard! that was SOOO much fun! right after publications, Julianna, Julie, and I went to the gym and started setting up chairs for the bball game. haha we put out 15 chairs FOR EACH team and almost ran out of chairs. Julianna THEN said,""wait, not all the players are going to be sitting at once!"" and we had to re-set the chairs! great job to us! we played an EASY game against International-we won by 60 points-66 to 6! haha well, it was cool, lots of people came to cheer us (well the other team by the time the game was close to ending) on (indcluding hedgie! yay!)

not much else happened today, so I won't write much else...

Julianna, Julie, and I decided not to do ANYTHING during publications, so we went down to the gym, received my bball uniform (WOOT!) and when I got my uniform, Julianna and Julie put my shorts (which are HUGE) over their jeans and we walked away while all the guys were just looking at us like we were freaks! (haha we are) then went back upstairs to get the camera from ms j and then went BACK down to the gym-to take pictures~yeah right, we only went down to hang out with the athetics elective (and to see the guys):) well we barely took any pix and just really were sitting watching the elective play kickball! it was hilarious!

"event","I had SUCH a bad day yesterday!
YESTERDAY:
School was boring as usual and I had a test I soo failed, I wasn't feeling so great, and then to top it off, I had basketball 2 hours after school ended. There is no point in going home and then coming all the way back to school, as I live 30 min from school. So after school, I was waiting with Julianna and Sarah at Syufi for soo long. It wasn't just the wait, but god it was COLD!!!! haha Mikey and I switched shoes and he almost broke mine because he didn't fit in them!:) well Julie came at like 420 and we were freezing our butts off, so we decided that we'd go off campus for food early! we left at like 440, put our stuff down in the gym, and ran (literally) to Mayflower and Tully's where we kept somewhat warm. In Tully's we bought large coffees, not smart before basketball. So we ran back at like 510 and went down to the gym with Annie who came later. Our locker room in the gym is right next to the girl's bathroom. As we walked closer to the locker room, we got light-headed. We slowly started to figure out the smell...it was pot!!! these fans from the highschool bball game (from the other team) smoked pot in the bathroom! ahh! we could barely breathe! When we went downstairs and started practicing before our coaches got there, I had to practice on the basket closest to the smell and I felt like fainting on the spot. Basketball practice wore me out! I didn't expect to be soo tired, but maybe the smell got to me. When I finally got home like 845, I immediately got in the shower, not remembering the homework I had to do. When I got out of the shower (like 915) I started on my homework. While I was working on my History assignment-I started to rub my right eye because it was bothering me. When you have contacts, that's not a good idea. so my contact either fell out, or got caught in my eye and didn't come out until like 1030 where I still had homework to do! finally when I went to sleep, I woke up at like 230 this morning, sneezed, and then couldn't fall asleep for my life!

oh yeah! and yesterday, I learned that one of my good friends might have a chronic disease with a low survival rate!! argh! that was bad!

"event","argh! my class is composed of such idiots! 

so to begin with:
there is an alcohol partay (we're only in 8th grade!) so duh, people get in trouble-they weren't going to get away with it! come on!
so the people who went get busted-so they have another! wow that was stupid. now sooo many people are acting like jerks!

then we move onto:
alright we love the guys in our grade (well most)! so some decide, ""today I like this person"" and then make out with them the same day, ask them out, and then over the weekend...make out with another guy!!!!! I mean I don't like these guys, but I just feel bad! I would hate to be in their place!

after that:
other girls decide: ""wow I do NOT like going out with guys, but I LOVE leading them on, flirting with them, kissing them, and then not going out with them so that they feel really bad that they ever tried""!!! I mean come on! I don't like these guys either, but I still feel bad for them

we move on:
these girlies who've done this all fall into all these situations! they all used to be sweeties who would come up to you to have a nice chat instead of a bragging session about which guy they made out with and dumped in the same day! god, I loved them before this year, now I'm just NOT SURE! they've changed too much for me to know for sure!

well I'll keep you all posted on things...

I made this a while ago, but now that I have a couple people's entries I like to see, I made on myself! Woot!

Wow, today was such a typical day! 
School: Fun Stuff! Really we did nothing special, but in science our table FINALLY won ONE game! ahh! haha we suck! I've never been off campus for that kind of stuff! hehe I always ruin it for my table :P well that made my day! we had some weird concert in the middle of the day for the chorus people who are singing on Wed...sorry guys, don't think I'm going to come! maybe next time! Well they were pretty good. The little kiddies were awesome! In that last song when they all bursted out with ""JOY TO THE WORLD"" and then those little girls scratching their legs and then shaking around to the beat! haha aww it was adorable! oh wow that made me miss NOTABLES :( oh well! it was fun while it lasted! hehe aren't i just ohhh sooo sweet? hehe. alright, what else did we do? oh yeah! haha in Literature: we had to make those lists of stereotypical things you find in a kidnapping! jeez scary! Ohhh! hahahahah in the afternoon period in English, we were going through some homework we weren't supposed to have, and Lez said the wrong answer and so Ms Charm started to like yell at her, but she was trying to make the point of ""interrogating"" her! hahha Lez got so scared! it was cute! she was like ""pluto????"" haha. that was good and fun!
After school: Student Council! I can't believe I have to be on the SC for a whole year! ohh well I'll have to get over it. So basically the WHOLE time, Pam and I were finishing the hilarious skit for our xmas sing-a-long! it was fun because we didn't have to sit through the meeting :) yay! haha
Home: wow homework, not that much, but then again we have a science test tomorrow! Grody! I don't like science tests, they're like 18 pages long in a 40 min period! ouch! oh well, I can't complain, I'm doing well in science! :)

Hopefully tomorrow will be more fun, but the science test and 2.5 hour basketball practice might bring it down. But! in religion (yes I know, RELIGION???!!!) we get candy canes! woot! haha well I'm signing off for the night!

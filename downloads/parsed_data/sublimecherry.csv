"event","Hey people! well im glad to be home i had an awesome time at mias house! Her and I ate so much junk food that we were just gonna sumo wrestle and bounce each other off onto the couches...Ya we ate alot of shit but its all good. Ya I met Jake, whom is mias current boyfriend. He is a really great guy, he messes around with her a little but really who doesnt!? lol you know i lovid you babes. And i also met Daniel, which im really glad i did. I was able to hang out with him and not have to think about people down here. No offense...but a few no what i mean. Ya, anywho, Daniel is a really great guy and you know, I have that feeling where i wish i never left..I dont know, he just seemed really sweet. Mia and I met up with Jake at daniels house for new years and it was so sweet. We watched waterboy which was fucking hilarious and everyone kept asking me, ""Danny what time is it?!"" and im like jesus! we have another 15 minutes lol...You can only wonder why the guys were a little nervous and kept asking for the time. But anywho when it was five minutes till new years, we turned off the tv and we started listening to jet, are you gonna be my girl. It was so hot..o ya lol..but anywho the ball dropped and Daniel kissed me. It was like aww so romantic! Lol and he told me not to forget about him, and well how could I? He was the first guy i ever kissed on new years lol. And of course mia and jake were going at it since we got there which i didnt mind they looked so cute together...But today was the first day back school ::sigh:: It was alright though i just got tired in seventh period because of our gay ass sub. Then cookie took me home. Well first we took adam (his whore) to his house..well had to stop by a couple places before that but that doesnt really matter..cough cough..lol..im such a loser. then just me and cookie in the car listening to some cradle of filth...kick ass band of course...then we picked up the lovely alicia from school. (Alicia being cookies girlfriend) then chad was there! i was like ah ha! chadwick! from middle school! that i havent talked to in a rather long time so of course that was pimp..The funny thing is by the time i got home i like saw my bus twice and im like ha! look at that gay ass bus...thats right...keep on drivin...o ya biatch.
Peace out my homie G Dawhg!

"event","Dude ok i understand he probably said he was single in his profile to get back at me for like having guys in my profile. I only did that cause i didnt know what i wanted, come to think of it i still dont konw what i want. I keep getting these ideas or i keep wanting to believe in what other people tell me. I want to listen, i want to believe in every word that comes out of their mouths, but i have to be my own person. I have to just let it fall in my lap then me going out and trying to find it. If i were to do that it would never come to me. 
I want to think everyone who has said something or tried to but some light back in my life, but i have to find my muse on my own. Sure, ill admit i love him, but its something we've heard over and over again and probably still questioning it to this day, arent i right? Its the truth whether you want to believe it or not. Sure i've had feelings for people i didnt quite understand or wasnt really ready for that sort of shit, but now that i know what it is and a feeling that i didnt get over with in a week. i'll call it my first love...that one i'll always remember.
i've had close ones and ones from a third party to say to me dont sweat it, you'll get back together in a period of time. I have this feeling though that im going to deny that offer. Im sick and tired of feeling incomplete with you. I need to get out and have fun! not feel like im being apart of someones possession. I love you and im telling you this so you dont forget it, but what explanation can you give me saying this is going to work out after the 4th or 5th time...seriously!? 
Try not to be hurt by the fact that i need to get over you, try do the same and we'll both feel, well who knows how we'll feel, probably really depressed at first but we can get over it. 
Love Always
Danny"

"event","Well, this past friday i went downtown and hung out with monica and juan. At first it was a little uncomfortable, but then towards the middle and end of the nite it got so much better. Juan is really sweet and im glad him and monica are together. We went and saw Oceans 12...it was good, but it could have been so much better. They needed more action and a little more strategising..and a bigger gig. I met up with cookie and alisha down there..of couse funny shit was bound to happen. And it did. 
I tried another couple of ciggs but i keep reminding myself why i stopped the last few times and im like fuck it, i just wont smoke. I saw Nathan down there, and it seemed like he got a new girlfriend so i was happy for him. He needs to be loved by a member of the opposite sex. haha. 
As for me, so juan says, i need to find a guy that loves me as much as he loves monica which is alot, and i need a boyfriend that appreciates me and would do anything to see me. It just i have such a hard time it seems with keeping a long term relationship. Honestly, kyle was the longest ive ever dated a guy and that was like for a year on and off. But there is this dude in Indiana that mia wants me to hook up with. His name is Daniel. From what i know hes in a band (so hot) and hes best friends with mias current boyfriend Jake. Jake is the lead singer in the band and Daniel is the lead guitarist...omg...score...Mia was like talking to me the other day and she was like ha! i think we are going to have a hook up when someone gets up here. Ha.. god that would be so funny. But in order to even think about doing anything. Im going to have to do it cause im over kyle, not because i wanna do it to get back at him and have fun. I dont wanna do that. Im still always going to love kyle, its just some stuff im going to have to take care of before i can move on. What bothers me the most is, when him and i try to be friends he doesnt act like one. Like, I had three of my friends come up to me and they noticed that when ever i would try to get near kyle or have a conversation with him he just walks off, and im like thank you! i thought i was the only one noticing that. Hes the one who mentioned that we should be friends and when i try to act like one i get shot down.
It makes me really fucking sad too. Cause i love him i always will. I just cant stand for him not to be in my life. But if the only way of talking to him is dating him that theres lack of communication or something. I just dont want him and i to feel wierd around each other. But screw that... damn
Love
Danny"

"event","Well, it's been some time since i posted, so I figured I would let you all know what I am doing with my exercise regimen.

Stretching
1 mile run (yes, 1 mile - that's the first time I've ever been able to do that)
Cores (abs/back type work)
Weights (I alternate bis/tris delts, chest/back, and legs - I use free or assisted weights, depending on the exercise, 10-12 reps per weight)
20 minutes on either the cross-trainer or the step climber - a hard mode (endurance or strength training).
Cool Down.

It's about an hour and feels great.

Current Weight: 178.5

Beginning of this: 239.5

Goal is 175 even.

- Rich"

You have a wide range of knowledge and you're very detail oriented.<br />
You have a photographic memory, and you remember places very well.<br />
<br />
Like a middle ages cartographer, you're also very adventurous and curious about the world.<br />
In modern times, you would make a good non-fiction writer or scientist.

Today, it is between 75-85 with a chance (slight) of rain.

TOmorrow, it will be between 75-85 with a chance (slight) of rain.

The rest of the week, it will be between 75-85 with a chance, however slight, of rain.

I'm not complaining, just noting that our channel #23 in the area where I live has no use here - and it's largely south of Hurricane alley.

"event","After not being able to exercise for a month, I wondered what my weight would be. Granted, I did lose an internal organ with stones, so that has to count for something. On the other hand, normally I only drop weight when I am exercising. However, post-surgery, I have to maintain a low fat diet, and I am always looking for low-cal stuff to begin with.

As of today, I weigh 183.5 pounds. Start of 239 - so 55.5 pounds lost. I will try to get to 175 by Christmas, and that's where I will stop and seek to maintain it."

My  neighbors claim that I've violated the neighbor hood zoning laws by building the  <st1:state w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Ark</st1:place></st1:state> in my yard  and ex ceeding the height limitations. We had to go to the Development Appeal  Board for a decision.<br /><br />Then the Department of Transportation demanded a  bond be posted for the future costs of moving power lines and other overhead  obstructions, to clear the passage for the <st1:state w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Ark</st1:place></st1:state>'s move to the sea. I told them that the  sea would be coming to us, but they would hear nothing of it.<br /><br />Getting the  wood was another problem. There's a ban on cutting local trees in order to save  the spotted owl. I tried to convince the environmentalists that I needed the  wood to save the owls - but no go!<br /><br />When I started gathering the animals,  an animal rights group sued me.<br /><br />They insisted that I was confining wild  animals against their will. They argued the accommodations were too restrictive,  and it was cruel and inhumane to put so many animals in a confined  space.<br /><br />Then the EPA ruled that I couldn't build the <st1:state w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Ark</st1:place></st1:state> until they'd condu  cted an environmental impact study on your proposed floo d.<br /><br />I'm still  trying to resolve a complaint with the Human Rights Commission on how many  minorities I'm supposed to hire for my building crew.<br /><br />Immigration and  Naturalization are checking the green-card status of most of the people who want  to work.<br /><br />The trades unions say I can't use my sons. They insist I have to  hire only Union workers with Ark-building experience.<br /><br />To make matters  worse, the IRS seized all my assets, claiming I'm trying to leave the country  illegally with endangered species.<br /><br />So, forgive me, Lord, but it would  take at least 10 years for me to finish this <st1:state w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Ark.</st1:place></st1:state>""<br /><br />Suddenly the skies cleared, the  sun began to shine, and a rainbow stretched across the sky. Noah looked up in  wonder and asked, ""You mean you're not going to destroy the world?""<br /><br />""No,""  said the Lord. ""The government beat me to it.""</div><br /><br />"

I've seen Democrats and Republicans, in roughly equal measure, have their failings. Whether it's because they had urgings they sought to hide (McGreevey, Larry Craig), or because they feel that power makes them immune, such as Bob Packwood,and apparently, the Governor of the State of New York, power is a drug. We often hear say that ""Money is the root of all evil"" but the actual phrase is ""For the love of the money is the Root of all Evil"" <i>Timothy 6:10, New Testament<i>, Christian Bible.</i> <br /><br /></i>Dropping the religious pretext for just a moment, there's a powerful sentiment there. It's not money itself that is the issue: it's lusting for it, wanting it, rather than fairly earning it and using it for the greater good of one's family and friends. It is the same with power: it's not having it that is the issue - many people who have had it have done well with it, FDR, Reagan, to name one from each party. It's becoming enmeshed in power, loving it for its own sake, and thinking that having it shields you from scrutiny that is the root problem. <br /><br />I am deeply and bitterly disappointed. Governor Spitzer ran on a platform of change. He carried a banner of public moral authority, and now that authority is most likely a sad sham, and we are all lessened for it."

When I went to get Cullen from his grandmothers for Cub Scouts, he was in a right foul mood. Not sure why - and his reactions of negativity were directed at about 100 things, so I had no clue what he was really upset about - but man, was he ticked. So, I had just recently acquired ""Quiet Riot's Greatest Hits"" - it was basically a rehash of the only 2 albums any one ever owned: ""Metal Health"" (1983) and ""Condition Critical"" (1984).

Just for fun, I played QR's version of&nbsp; ""MAma, Weer All Crazee Now"". Cullen broke out into laughter. It was great. He was in such high spirits - laughter the whole way. 

So, just remember, Hair Metal makes 6 year olds happy."

This letter is an apology.  I am sorry that my best sometimes sucks ass.  I am sorry that I keep letting people down.  I am sorry that I have lied.  I am sorry that I continue to pretend everything is OK.

All I want to do right now is graduate with my fucking certificates and LEAVE.  I love living in Winnipeg, but not enough to live here for more than a year longer.  I want to comne back next year, improve my transcript and then gradute and leave.

Yeah, ok, I haven;t told anybody mainly because I am afraid of failing but I failed a class last year.  And the rest of my course marks were pretty shitty.  So here I am, on Academic probation, and I still can;t get my fucking course work done.

The worst thing about it, is that it has gotten to the point where I am no longer ""worried"" about it.  A feeling of relaxation has washed over me which is making it harder to keep motivated.  As if I don't have a hard enough time.

I just handed in an assigment worth 35 percent of my mark today when it was due a week ago.  To top it all off, I think I did the assignment all wrong, and I have yet to hand in a paper for the same class that was due at the beginning of the semester.

I am fucking up so bad and I can't control it anymore.  So do you know what I do?  I ignore it all and pretend things are great.  WELL THEY ARE NOT

Kelly, I know you will probably read this.  I miss you so much.  And I just hate that I have felt like I couldn;t tell you any of this.  It makes things worse not to fess up to what is happening.

My parents keep calling me and asking me if things are alright.  Why do I lie?  I don;t want to be a liar.  I just lie I guess because it is easier than telling the truth.  But then it eats away at me.  But I want to tell my parents in person, but that obviously sin;t going to work when they live 30 hours away.

Now I have been told that if I don't get my marks up, I might be expelled from the institution.  That makes no sense to me.  It is not like I want to come back next year and take a full course load and take courses I haven;t already taken.  I just want to come back and retake some courses I did shitty in, and only 6 credit hours a semester.  I think that is a fair idea.

I haven't been kicked out.  I haven;t flunked out.  And if I get all my assignments done I am sure I won't.  But I don't know if I can do it anymore.  I don't know if I can sit at the computer and type out bullshit anymore.  It just makes me feel even more dazed and confused and lost.

I am so lost right now.  I feel like I had the carpet pulled out from under me.  I don't know what I want with my life.  I am only 19.  I am appauled that people would just expect me to know, and expect me to fork over THOUSANDS of dollars on an education I feel is pointless.  Not all of it is pointless, but the majority of it is.

What if I just want to learn how to cook.  That is a practical skill.  Paying to learn how to do that wouldn't be a waste of money.

It is embarassing.  It is embarassing to consistently not have the ability to focus on your school work.  Some teachers think I might have A.D.D.  FUCK YOU!

For anybody who knows me, they know I don't swear.  I am feeling really fucking angry and God, and at my parents, and at my teachers, and at myself, and at my friends, and at my church, and at my school, and at anything else that I feel like feeling angry at.

I am like bawling right now

I just, I can;t do it anymore.  I can't pretend everything is ok.  But I can't face up to the fact that I am not ok.  School is not Ok.  Work is not Ok.  Money is not Ok.  I AM FUCKED!

I really want to call kelly.  Fuck but she is probably sleeping.  It is 30 in the morning over there.  But I need to talk to somebody.  How come I feel like I have no one to talk to.  IO am so far away from home.  This place isn't home.  This place is hell right now.  To hell with it all.  I think I will try and text Kelly

I don't want to wake her house up though.  What is she has class

Sorry for all this.  I just, yeah, I don't know

I wish I could just get out of all the responsibilty.  Pawn it off on some sort of life threatenning disease

I think I will text Kelly."

"event","I suffer from a serious case of trying to pretend everything is OK.  For instance, when I am worried about money I shop shop SHOP.  More recently (as in presently) I have procrastinated so much that my work load has piled up into an unmanagable pile, and yet here I am pretending everything will be just fine.... Myspacing and MSNing and Facebooking and LJing.

How does this make sense?  I don't know.  It doesn't really, I just keep into my pattern of unhealthy procrastination and hope everything pulls through.

GAHHH!  How come I canNOT focus, on anything, at anytime, in any circumstance?  Ok, maybe I am being a bit dramatic.  But I DO have a hard time consentrating!!!  Don't give me any of this time management B.S.  It is not for me.  What I need are restraints, and a plain white room in order to use my time wisely.

One of my friends told me how classical music puts her into a study mood.  I wonder if I could train my brain to be put into a study mood with something like that.  It wouldn't hurt to give it a try, however I don't think I will manage to accomplish that for the coursework this week.

I am starting to think that college just isn't for me and my non cooperative brain.... AND my budget!


And that is my rant for the week...... enjoy!"

"event","Are you wondering why I have my title in quotes, well it is a quote.  That is why.  Guess what from...

Anyways it applies to my life in general.  For a little bit there you could say I wasn't loving life so much.  No I wasn't depressed.  I was just so homesick that it made me angry.

Anyways,  I kind of locked myself in my house for the majority of my Christmas Break back home because I was miserable that I had to leave again.  I know it doesn't make much sense, but that was how it happened.

Then when I got back to Winnipeg I started feeling alot less homesick, but sad that I hadn't made the effort to spend times with my friends back home.  To make things worse I have NEVER been good at emailing or calling people to stay in touch, no matter how much I miss my friends.

The good thing about this all is that somehow I feel alot better about everything.  I still miss my friends (ALOT) but I know they love me enough to not forget me.  I know I should be calling more and staying in touch, but I don't HAVE to because I honestly think the friendship I have with my three very best (and greatest) friends will never wilt away.

So here is a call out to Emily, Kelly, and Steph!

I am doing well, and I miss you all very much!

MUAH!

"event","So here is the situation.

I just got hired for a waitressing position at Cherry Creek Cafe.  I have been wanting a job as a waitress for some time now.  The strange part is that now that I have it I am not sure if I want it.  Goodness I wish things were just simple.

I will explain.  Or atleast I will try to.  I think I am a coward.  I am scared to tell my current job that I am quiting.  I am scared to quit because I am scared that I won't do so well as a waitress and will basically be fired.  I am scared of my managers at my current job.  They are the stereotypical popular type girls.  They either love you or they hate you.  That is all fine and good if you handle it like a professional, but they don't.  And when they are nice, they are REALLY nice.  When they are in a bad mood they are REALLY crappy.  It is a stressor in itself.

I don't know.  I suppose it would be ALOT easier if I wasn't quiting my job and starting my new job all in the same mall, on the same floor, about three dorrs apart from each other.  It is really icky.

But Yayyness that I got hired!  Now I get to wear a white colored shirt with a black tie.  Good times!  I really don't think I suit a tie.

Other than that I have very little new news.  I am having Thanksgiving dinner at my friends apartment tomorrow.  No they are not american!  They just didn't have time to cook anything until tomorrow."

"event","I was thinking about what I do for fun during the week.  Like what I do in between class, work and school work.  To be honest I don't know what I do.  I can't even remember if I have time to DO something.  I suppose I quickly check my email,  I talk to some people.  But then what?  What do I do.  I really want to try and figure it out becuase I must be doing SOMETHING.

It is sad to realize that I have nothing to show for my spare time.  It would be neat if I had something to show.  If somebody asked me what I do in my spare time I would be able to actually SHOW them what I do.  Like a puzzle, or reading a book.  But nope, instead people ask me what I do and I can honestly answer ""I don't know"".  Maybe this is a college/university student trait, but it is none-the-less sad.

Do I even have spare time?  Well obviously I have some right now because I am blogging.  But I dont normally blog, so what happened to all my ""extra"" time.

Hmph!  This is boggling my mind.

Now I am going to go and work on my paper until like 11pm!  What a life!"

"event","This weekend was overall amazing!

I spent Friday working all day.  Then I went to a creepy bar filled with old Mexican men who hit on young Mexican woman.  My friends and I are not Mexican but this maybe 60 year old man was trying to dance dirty with us all.  Major barf!

Then Saturday I prettied myself up for work because after work I was going out to a fancy place with nome other friends of mine.  I finished work at 5, headed over to their apartment.  They made me supper (kraft dinner) and then I kinda just lazed around at their place until we left at 11:30pm.  So yeah we were out late and it was great.

I slept over at their house and was awakened by my friend standing over me and staring at me.  I almost peed myself I was so startled.  We went to church, then back to their place.  They made me yummy food.  Then we layed around and watched Harry Potter 4 and Signs.  I attempted to play the guitar (never again) and yeah.  We watched Desperate Housewives and then it was time for me to go.

Amazing weekend of nothingness, and laughs.

Best part of it all is that I am pretty positive I lost the key to my store."

"event","Today I helped take 32 kids to a huge concert thing.  It was crazy, but awesome.  One of the girls is sooo cute.  I was talking with her one sunday and all of a sudden she said ""You look like a witch!""  She then proceeds to explain why.  This is a direct quote, ""Because your hair is frizzy, and you have spots (freckles) on your face.""  Ok so maybe my hair was a LITTLE frizzy that day, and I do have freckles but how does that make me look like a witch.?  I was laughing so hard I almost peed myself.  Ok she finished things off with this comment, ""but it is OK Melanie because witches aren't real anyways.""  Soooo funny.

Anyways at the concert today she was sitting beside me.  She then turns to me and says ""Melanie, you need a bath""  *Jaw drops*  She is SOOOO random.  Yeah so apparently I look like a withc and I smell.  Lovely

Anyways I worked today.  That was boring as usual.  Then I came back and slept from 5:30-9:00.  Then I went to support some of the guys from my school at a hockey game.  I had to walk down some pretty sketchy streets but we managed to make it alive.

Now I am going to go eat some really yummy pizza.

The end!"

"event","Ok.  I need some sort of sympathy.  NOT EMPATHY, specifically sympathy.  I spent like seven hours yesterday analyzing my use of empathy.  SYMPATHY.

Ok let me give you a summarization of my week.  First of all I need to explain that I have four classes this semester.  Each class starts at 8:30am.  So my schedule looks like this: Monday I have no class (Wahoo).  Tuesday I have Worship Foundations from 8:30-12.  Wednesday I have Studies of the Pentateuch from 8:30-12.  Thursday I have Practice of Leadership from 8:30-12.  Friday I have Introduction to Counseling.  Each class is taught by a different instructor.  Thats it.  Usually I love this schedule.  This week was an exception.

Ok How did I manage to have FIVE (yes 5) major assignments due between FOUR classes in ONE week?  How? How?  How is that even the slightest bit fair?  Anyways I got maybe 15 hours of sleep from Monday to today.  If you know me well you know that I need at least TEN hours of sleep in order to speak, act, look, smell (lol), and think properly.  So I am currently lacking approximatly 25 hours of sleep.  JEEPERS.

You might be wondering WHY I am staying up and writing this.  Well to be honest I think it would be good to get into the habit of blogging.  So what better night to start?

Yes tonight is a short blog.  But I need to practice Okay?  Give me SOME credit!

And comment.  I love comments.  I feel like I am lacking in my happy comment bank.  So comment!"

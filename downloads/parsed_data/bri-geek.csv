"event","I am getting so busy that putting my website back up and redesigning it won't be happening for a long time. I really need to start writing again to help me keep my sanity for the next few weeks at least.

This trip has really opened my eyes in so many ways that I don't even know where to start... I guess I will start at the beginning.

I landed in Rochester New York on Thursday afternoon, it was such a beautiful day. The sun was out, it was warm and just absolutely perfect. J picked me up from the airport and I kissed him for so long. J has this thing where he can't kiss me just once. When he starts to kiss me, it is hard for him to stop. We drove to his awesome house. His house is so cool actually. It is definitely not a normal college kids place. Its so nice and so much room. Him and his room mate just need to learn to clean up after themselves a bit better. I met Dan and played a bit of Halo 3 before we left to drive to NYC. J got tired on the way to NYC, so we made a pit stop in Albany NY and stayed the night in a nice suite (we watched the worst movie ever! Nicholas Cage.. in Next... sooooo cheesey). I fell asleep next to J as he held me.

Waking up to the alarm the next day, we both got up and had some breakfast before we finished the drive to NYC. Oh my... NYC is crazy as hell. Traffic is insane. The parking garages are nuts. The place was such beautiful chaos! When brought or luggage up to his sister apartment and went to eat at this little dinner. The eggs benedict was supposedly really good, or so J said. We walked down the street to his Mommy and Daddy's place. I finally met his mom, who I must admit is super cool. She gave J the dress cloths he left behind when the were in Wyoming a few weeks back. J and I left to head to Time Square. All I can say is WOW.. it was so busy and crazy and just huge! People and stores everywhere. I saw the MTV studio, Radio City Music Hall, and a bunch of places I have only seen on TV. We hoped into the Sanrio store to look around (I LOVE HELLO KITTY!). We looked around the store for awhile, and I saw this watch... it was so pretty. It had white and silver with a gold Hello Kitty head on the inside that had diamonds and pink stones swirling around on the inside. It was so pretty, so J told me to try it on. Well, needless to say... he bought me the watch for my birthday present. I am now the proud owner of this amazingly pretty HK watch. IEEE!!! J and I left Time Square and headed to Central Park. We decided we wanted to see the zoo. It was so much fun. I have always loved going to the Zoo and looking at the animals, but being with J made it so much more fun. After we walked around Central Park for a bit, we headed back to the apartment to change for our night out. He looked so good when we went out to dinner at BLT Steak House. I have never had so much amazingly tasty food in my whole entire life! I think J made the reservations a week ahead of time. It was a perfect dinner... and I was a bit drunk. My god was I drink. He paid for dinner... must I add the bill was like the price of a grocery store visit for a family of 4 or 5... J is crazy like that >.< We headed back out to the Musical Wicked at the Gershwin. We got a few glasses of Champagne and watched the most amazing show I have seen my whole entire life. The song Defying Gravity is one of my favorite songs from a musical BY FAR! After the musical, J got us a cab... it was and old 1950's cab that some old man drives around. It was the coolest cab I have ever been in! One more stop for the night... J took me on a horse and carriage ride through Central Park late that night. It was so amazing. After the carriage ride we headed back to the apartment to spend the rest of our amazing night together. One of the most romantic nights of my life.

We woke up the next day late. I decided to let us sleep in and skip the museum this time. I really wanted to see the MoMA, but I was hung over and just wanted to lay and bed with J that morning. We both got ready and headed to his parents place to meet up with them for lunch. His sister also came with. I must say, that I do love J's family. They are so down to earth and giving people. They are just so great, I can't wait to spend more time with them.  We had lunch at an amazing burger place, then J and I headed back to Rochester. When we got back to Rochester, we went out to dinner at the Olive Garden with Dan. Dan is from Croatia and by far the coolest European I have ever met. J and I got a bit drunk at dinner before we went out to the movie ""Good Luck Chuck"" with Dan. It was a pretty funny movie, typical Ben Stiller movie IMO. We headed back home to have a few drinks and watch ""We Are Marshal"", I was too tired to stay up so I went upstairs to pass out. J said when he came upstairs that I was dead  asleep and wrapped up like a little Bri Burrito in his comforter.

On Sunday we decided to wake up and go grocery shopping so I could cook them dinner that night. We also ran to JC pennys and bought J some new bed sheets since his dog like to tear up his shit. We watched 28 days later and I started cooking Enchiladas for dinner. They were so fucking good. So very tasty. After dinner, J and I went upstairs to start raiding. At this point him and I really havent played WoW in days and needed our fix. After raids, J and I watched Saw. It was pretty good... kinda weird.. but good. We then proceeded to spend the last few hours of the night doing what any couple so in love would do. ;)

I woke up this morning completely depressed. We both realized that we don't want to live without each other anymore. Being apart from each other just makes us both more stressed and upset. When J dropped me off at the airport today, I started crying like crazy. I didn't want to stop kissing him... I didn't want to let go. I knew I had to, but God Damn it hurt so much. I keep thinking I shouldn't get on my flight today and that I shouldn't go home, but I know I have so many ties at home yet that I have to break. But now to announce it to everyone...

Yes, I will be moving to Rochester New York to live with J, and yes, we are so happy in love that we know we want to spend our lives together. Do I care if people doubt or love for each other? No, no I don't. You will just have to see for yourselves how happy in love we both are. If we can last through this long distance relationship as long as we have, I have no doubt in my mind that we can make it through pretty much anything. Sitting in the airport writing this, is one of the most upsetting feelings ever. I just want to walk out of this building right now and go to J's place and be there when he gets home.

I can't wait to get all of this figured out so i can be back."

"event","Things seem to be getting progressively worse. I guess its the only way they can get before it becomes better... right?

I'm going to hand in my resume for a tech job tomorrow. Hopefully I will get it. The hours are perfect... will give me enough time for going out drinking and still being able to raid.

I'm not sure why, but it seems as though most people take advantage of what I have to offer or walk all over me. I guess the problem is that I give everyone some form of trust at the start. I need to stop doing that. All people do deserve their own clean slate with me. I don;t know them and such, but it ends up they dont start me with a clean slate and always thing I am lying, or something totally rediculous. I pour my heart out to too many people, and I guess, I am supposed to be taken lightly. 

Other than being in a constant state of fucked up emotions, I'm ok. I seem to always be sick, but that is usual and I think it comes with the depression.
DH is doing ok. We're going through a rough patch, but I'm hoping I can help the guild push through it. I love them too much to watch it disappear.

I miss love and everything that goes with it.

Only a few more days and my nephew will be gone. Kids are just way too much for me."

"event","I had one of these bitches back in the day, but moved on to making my own site and such. Now I am back, but my stay should only be temporary. Why you may ask? I cannot write stuff I want to on my site because way too many people know about it, and given&nbsp; my situation, many of these people can't know what is going on. So, I decided to come back here so I can start choosing who I want to read my shit until the day arrives when I can say this shit aloud and everyone can know. By that point it won't matter what anyone says, because it will be all over and done with and I will already be moving on to that point in my life. And, if you are one of the lucky few who get to see my private posts, congratulations, you win at life."

"event","As a realtor AND as a person who was faced with having bad credit because of the ""freshman in college with credit"" dilemma about 9 years ago I really do know what challenges people are going through to obtain financing to purchase a home. The best way to get the help you need is find a good, no... GREAT realtor.

Why? Because they work with many lenders and are aware of different lending programs that various finance companies use. 

Once you have found a few lenders, talk with them. Or rather, talk with ONE of them, have them pull your credit and find out what the reality of your situation is. Oftentimes, you have been told one thing by a lender and something else by another lender only because they don't have any programs that support the financing that you may require. Thats why its always good to know of a few different lenders who work with individuals that MAY have bad credit. Once you find out what your FICA scores are (FICA scores are configured by pulling credit from the 3 main credit bureaus and with your credit history, come up with a credit score) AND have a copy of your credit reports then you can shop for a lender OR get started writing letters to repair your credit. A good lender who earnestly wants to help you, the individual, achieve your goal of being a homeowner will council you on how to fix your credit. 

Once you have decided to fix your credit keep in mind that it can take awhile. It doesn't happen overnight. But it is possible.

As for lending options, there are too many to even name and its not my specialty. But if you want a couple of ideas from a non-biased individual in the business of finding homes feel free to holler at me. I won't be able to help you find a home but I should be able to help you understand whats happening and hopefully, help you fix it."

"event","Going to answer your questions in reverse.

How do you go about finding a good realtor in the sea of them in a big city? 

One way to find a realtor is how the above individual suggested but there can be potential loyalty issues involved with this. In Washington State, the listing agent represents the seller unless the seller and the buyer has agreed on dual agency. Dual Agency is where the agent acts as an intermediary between the buyer and the seller leaving the two parties to agree on terms. With out both the buyer and the seller agreeing to dual agency, then the seller's agent still only represents the seller, even if he is doing your paperwork. Having your own buyer's agent who is not the listing agent gives you more control over the entire process.
How do you find an agent of your own? A good way is to ask your friends, family, or coworkers who they used to purchase a home and what their experience was. If they had a great realtor and would recommend them to you, that would be the easiest and possibly the best route.

Next question...

Do you get a loan or a realtor first? 

It depends on what you want to tackle first. Find out how your finances play out to see what your home buying amount is OR search for homes with a realtor? I always have my clients contact a lender before going out to find a home. What could happen if you find a realtor first is that they show you homes first and then you find out that your home buying potential is completely different then what you are looking for in a home. So, I would talk with a lender about the different loan possibilities first. Then find a realtor. :)

Hope that this helps!"

"event","Working with buyers is always a very fun process, whether it be a first time home buyer or someone on their 8th home.  One statement I always hear with my clients is, ""How do I chose??"".  I can not stress enough that although you are buying a home for today, always think of what you would like to receive when its time for you to sell.  I would love to have my clients purchase something that makes sense for them now AND down the road.  

So, when you are weighing homes that you have seen, always question, ""Will it work for now and for when its time sell?""

(Courtesy MSN - House and Home)
No matter what your situation, take the time to really think about which home is best for you. Use the information you've collected to compare your first choice with other close candidates. Although it may be tempting to move quickly, you'll want to cover all the bases before you commit to a purchase. 

Weigh the trade-offs
House No. 1 may have all the features you want but the price is high and the seller is unmotivated. House No. 2 may need significant cosmetic work, but has all the other features you want, including the right price. Expect to go back and forth while you're debating your choice. 
Resale, resale, resale
There's an old real estate adage: ""Buy to live and to sell."" You may think you're going to be in your new home for the duration of the mortgage, but chances are you're not. Give sufficient weight to the home's potential resale value, and make sure you have all the facts. A planned expressway a block away could drastically change your home's resale value 20 years from now. 
Money, money, money
Make sure that your choice is within your price range and that you can obtain financing."

"event","WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday boosted interest rates for the sixth time since last June and signaled it may raise the cost of borrowing money further to help cool inflation. 

The Fed announced that it was raising its target for the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, by a quarter-point to 2.5 percent. Before the Fed began tightening credit last June, the funds rate had been at a 46-year low of 1 percent. 

The impact on mortgage rates will be effected by also going higher."

"event","Starting from the bottom and working to the top with your questions, keeping in mind that my focus is on real estate and not financing :):

Conventional loans: there are a PLETHORA of different loan programs out there with these being some of the best rates around with some needing no money down.

FHA Loans: FHA loans generally require a small percentage down payment but have a better interest rate then some other programs. In addition, they are backed by the government and don't usually require a mortgage insurance program.

If you have any questions about your credit score, the amount of home you can purchase, and whats needed for a down payment (if any!) I recommend speaking with a mortgage lender. They can pre-qualify you to find out how much you can afford. If you don't want to get pre-approved (meaning having a lender run your credit), the cheapest way to check your credit is getting your credit reports from the main credit bureau's. Know that this will not give you a credit score but only what is reporting in your credit. It also give you an opportunity to try and repair/correct anything that is reported incorrectly (and CHANGE it most importantly!). Another option would be using one of the credit bureau's online quick credit score systems. These aren't always accurate though and WILL change if you are thinking of buying in another year.

Lastly, don't make any major changes to your credit (as in buying another new car, filing bankruptcy, etc..) with out consulting with a lender and how this may/may not impact you.

After you have figured out your loan options, know how much home you can afford, and are ready to start the house hunting process in earnest, then its time to pick a realtor... which can almost be as challenging as the financing side! LOL Only kidding! Interviewing realtors or being referred to one is fun, sometimes tedious, but still fun once you found the realtor for you!"

Over the last year, I have had numerous clients that made offers on homes only to be turned down.  It wasn't that the offers to purchase the homes weren't great, they were, it was the market.  We are currently experiencing one of the most aggressive seller's markets in a very long time.  With being in a sellers' market, its driving home prices up in a rapid, almost frantic pace.  There are more buyers out there and the sellers can pick and chose which buyer they want to be the next owner of their home.  This is also resulting in good homes having multiple buyers placing offers.  Exactly because of these situations is why my client's lost their motivation.

It's really hard to recover and soldier on once you have found the home you really wanted only for it to be sold to someone else.  

The best thing to do is ask your agent why this happened.  The key is to understand the situation, learn from it, and look for a better house.  Your agent can only help you stay motivated so much, the rest is up to you to continue on.  If you want it hard enough, make it happen!

"event","The goal is to ensure that you're happy with the home you buy and that owning the home helps you accomplish your financial goals. To decide whether now's the time for you to buy a house, consider the advantages of buying.

  
Owning may be less expensive then renting

Here's a guideline that may change the way you view your monthly rent. To determine how much home you can afford to buy while having the same approximate monthly cost as your current rent, simply do the following calculation: 


Take your monthly rent, multiply by 200 = purchase price of home 


Example: $ 750 x 200 = $150,000 


In the preceding example, if you were paying rent of $750 per month, you would pay approximately the same amount per month to own a $150,000 home (factoring in tax savings). 


The costs as a renter in the future are even more important than the costs of rent today. As a renter, you are fully exposed to increases in the cost of living, also known as inflation. A reasonable expectation for annual increases in your rent is 4 percent per year."

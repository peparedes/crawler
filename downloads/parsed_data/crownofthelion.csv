"event","Well I woke up at 8:30 today to my hear the rhythimic voice of my lady, Leslie, we talked for a good long time. Through breakfast and lunch. Then I went over to my friends house and we lifted weights for a good two hours and I definately pulled something in my back I didn't feel it at the time but Gosh it hurts now and pain is no fun when it can be avoided. I did bench press, dumbell press, incline bench, curls, and a few other lifting techniques. So i got those muscles working then i headed over to my grandmas house for dinner we had a very appetizing spanish meal like a stew its always good. I played with her new toy poodle she got for her birthday the thing is seriously no bigger than like a sock if i could compare it to anything and its like barely a pound and its fat cause my grandma feeds it real food like rice and beans it should enjoy its life while it can lol im sorry to say but if it eats like that all the time it will have a short term on this earth. Then i came home and have been watching Nick at Nite cause im like an old person on the inside seriously i watch the price is right whenever i can... Bob Barker is a sexy beast....i mean theres great prizes on the show...anyways i'll be off cause im tired. Goodnight any and all."

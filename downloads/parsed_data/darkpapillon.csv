"event","its so pretty. this ideology.

when we're not together, you remember more strong..
the feeling..
you smile when you remember
turn your head when you frown
think deep inside, within
cherish within you one love

check your email by the hour
check your phone for messages daily
even when theres nothing there

cling to the memory thats there since you have nothing else
keeps you sane when the world crashes

wander off and find yourself following a memory


..

when i see butterflies, i think of you

"event","Merry Christmas eve everyone. I wont be around tomorrow So i'm saying it now.
sO, Here's a politically correct story.
Twas the night before christmas, and all through the non specific winter holiday not a creature known to earth was stirring not even a small monogomous rodent more commonly known as a mouse.
The non-token specific socks being referred to as stocking wer hung safely and without any risk of fire hazard above on the mantel with care.
Suddenly bells could be heard from atop the rooftop not damaging the shingles or snow pattern known to the roof of every child's rooftop when suddenly a non gender specific holiday figure decended in a non illegal manner to fill the houses of appropriately behaved and constitutional children of all races and belief's homes with presents pertaining to that chil's non-specific winter holiday figurative wishes.
The man was equipped with a red sleigh and eight non-gender specific heigh-deprivated young reindeer.
This has been a politically correct Santa Story.
By the way:
Santa can no longer say ""Ho Ho Ho"" So please refer to this phrase as the more sophisticated reinacment of the deprived old man as ""lady of the evening, lady of the evening, lady of the evening"" thank you."

"event","Turned over cardgames and emptied bottles. Lights dim and smells begin to fade. Open mouths and cried over eyes, broken hearts and dried up memories. I'll wash away here with things that used to be. The cheek that houses that scarlet tear, the blooded bath of lonliness that kisses the skin and parades off the jawline. The light that shifts over her face and glistens in her eyes as they release more salt sweet desire. The wolf who howls for the pack longing to be less than alone but remain strong. The silk patterned lashes soak themselves with bitter sweet romance. The water trickles and one can see who truly lies within. That broken embodyment which is the more childlike characteristic. The girl. Those wet lashes of silk."

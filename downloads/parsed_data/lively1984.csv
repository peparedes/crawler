"event","So the latest and greatest is the year of travel that Big C and I are planning.  
I refer to it as the WRT (world round travel). 
We've both put paying off credit cards on fast track and hope to save at least $12 000 by this time next year so this could mean that Summer 2007 may be quiet and our nails remain short and ""un-acrylic ed"", and possible stay that way for while after we get back considering how destitute we will be. 
Christine has been researching like a mad scientist, I've brushed the surface a bit, we know we'e got a long way to go in regards to figuring out how to put plan to action and as Christine puts it..how to not die."

Time flew by SO fast, just goes to&nbsp;prove ""time flies when you're having fun!"" .&nbsp; It gave the chance to&nbsp;hang out with everyone from work and get to know them a little bit better.&nbsp; You can tell everyone&nbsp;had&nbsp;a good time and some CRAZY pictures taken can show just that!&nbsp; I wish I could go back to that night and do it ALL over again!&nbsp; The ""after party"" was the tip of the iceberg I suppose you could say.&nbsp; Danah-Lee&nbsp;taught us a&nbsp;""drinking"" game called ""I have never...."" I'm surprised I've never hear of&nbsp;it before.&nbsp;Basically, you would&nbsp;say something like ""I have never sang in&nbsp;the shower..."" and if you have..well you take a drink and if not.. well the opposite.&nbsp; Hint: Sip slowly.</font>&nbsp; Everyone has a few laughs.</font></font></div>"

The evening began at 5:30 when the bus pulled out from in front of ATCO building and started the 8 hour drive that it would take to get to Kimberly,BC.&nbsp; A few games were played and music videos aired on the mini TVS attached to the ceiling of the bus.&nbsp; Then everybody had a drink which turned into a few drinks and by the time we reached Calgary for a stop at Peters Drive&nbsp;Thru&nbsp;everyone was feeling the effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, at approximately 1:00 am&nbsp;the bus&nbsp;pulled up in front of the georgeous cabins we would be lodging in and the bus was unloaded.&nbsp; Many people (including me) grabbed their stuff and headed right for bed.&nbsp; The next morning wasn't so pretty but that didn't stop me from grabbing a cold beer and heading to the hot tub at&nbsp;8:00 am, to which I went to my bed and took a 2 hour nap just in time to get up,&nbsp;have some BBQ and get showered for the keg party expected to happen later in the evening.&nbsp; The night ended with me in the hot tub again with a cold beer.&nbsp; I spent a good part of the next day (Sunday) snowboarding the mountains.&nbsp; This trip gave me the oppertunity to meet new people and just live it.&nbsp; I would do it again in a snap.</font></font></div>"

Just to note, I suppose it should be&nbsp;obvious who ""we"" are.&nbsp; It was Ms.Christine who emailed me at work the Friday morning and was all like ""let's go snowboarding in Banff this weekend!"".&nbsp; I knew she wasn't just joking around.&nbsp; My mood below shows optimistic because I knew we both had to wait until 5:00 to get off work and then make our way home on the bus and pack last minute to head out the door for the good 4hour drive.&nbsp; Never a complaint though, even if the trip was 11 hours I could handle it, there's never a boring silent moment&nbsp;if you put&nbsp;Christine and I together.&nbsp; The words we say may not make sense, but it is sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></font><br /><font color=""#000000"" size=""2"">Snowboarding was a first for Christine but she did pretty awesome if you ask me...considering I unknowingly put her on an intermediate run for the first time she attached both&nbsp;boots to the board. She only gave me a little rap and was on her way.&nbsp;Trooper. I boarded the entire mountain down and she opted for the gondola.until next time. Oh, did I mention she wanted to go again the following weekend?<br /><br />The 2 nights we stayed there flew by, as everything always does for me when I'm enjoying myself.&nbsp; But it was Easter weekend, and we wanted to be back in time to do the Easter dinner thing with the fam.</font></font>"

So, once again I'm at a loss as to where to start the story. Ok then, so when this particular road trip started out it was known to us a the Cabin Fever Escape to Nordegg at the HI-Shunda Creek Hostel. Let's give this the ""technical"" name but Christine and I could voucher an arguement there and call it "" Carolina-without-the-a getaway "" to later which I will explain. By the way, GGEDRON as noted in the Subject line is NORDEGG spelt backward Christine figured out, or the ""speck"" of Nordegg as she puts it not to miss it when you drive past @ 20 km/hr. Until now, we may have been the only humans on the planet to refer to the town Nordegg as Ggedron...any opposition?<br /><br />So of all the possibilities, why did we choose to make a roadtrip to a speck of Nordegg? I think no sane person would plan a RANDOM roadtrip to Nordegg unless there was a reason for it and I suppose our reason was to meet up with Edmonton Outdoor Club at a hostel where we would go snow shoeing and what have you the next day. That's fine, we got there and discovered everybody was either 10 years older or 10 years younger which wasn't horrible but when we woke up the Saturday morning and discovered that we were sharing a room with two 30+ males we decided to bail.&nbsp;<br /><br />We headed toward Rocky Mountain House trying to decide what to do with ourselves now. We ended up finding out that Jay, an old friend we used to hang out was working up in the area and was staying in a hotel in Caroline so we decided that's where we would stay and could visit again. So in the end of it all, Chistina and I ended up spending the day in a hotel in Carolina-without-the-a with some cold beers until he got off work that evening. And by chilling, I mean having toga party in the bed sheets, writing face on our stomachs and making them talk.</font>"

Because I was crying and the neighbours assocaited my crying with people that had come from the bar outside in the parking lot.&nbsp; They even called the cops because apparently we didn't get our stuff outside in a timely fashion!&nbsp; Crap if you ask me!&nbsp; NEVER stay at Bow Valley Motel is my only suggestion.<br /><br />So fine then,they want to be like that we found a hotel for just a little more and 110% nicer! Just wished we stayed there the entire time.</font>"

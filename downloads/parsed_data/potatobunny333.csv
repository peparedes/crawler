<P>Yes, my dearest Greenbean, I am feeling better.&nbsp; Sometimes I get so pissed at myself.&nbsp; I know none of this disease stuff is my fault, and as diseases go it's not a real biggie, but...well, you know.&nbsp; I was diagnosed just 3 years ago this month, and I often feel it's not a big deal at all, but then something happens and I am reminded of the intensity of the word ""chronic"".&nbsp; Like, forever.&nbsp; Sorry to be a downer.</P>
<P>I should probably be off to bed, I have a big day of cleaning out closets ahead of me.&nbsp; The epsanol-ies are putting in a new AC unit on Thursday, and I am seriously looking forward to not having to yell over the AC all the time.&nbsp; But I have to empy everything out of my closets so they can rip shit apart, and wouldn't you know, I haven't cleaned them out since we moved in?&nbsp; Excellent!&nbsp;*clap clap*</P>

"event","<P>I really am all discomboobalated about this Pres. Reagan thing.&nbsp; I admit that I don't know very much about him as a man or as&nbsp; a president--which makes me a bit embarassed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just saw Nancy cry on TV over her husband's casket and just <EM>lost it</EM>.&nbsp; How can she possibly be so composed?&nbsp; He was sick for so long, so I am sure a part of her is relieved, even the tiniest bit, that it's over.&nbsp; But...omg....the sheer loss.&nbsp; His space is no longer occupied in their home.&nbsp; I am sure his things are still in his drawer.&nbsp; This makes me dread getting older.&nbsp; It makes me almost sorry that I have the love of my life, because I may have to mourn him one day.&nbsp; What if I have to bury my child?&nbsp; What if I end up all alone?&nbsp; Will the years I have with my family comfort me?&nbsp; Or will I always feel the weight of their absence?&nbsp; </P>
<P>I am so afraid of being alone.&nbsp; I used to be scared of dying because it sounded like it hurt.&nbsp; If I was in an accident or some violent act, pain was a sure factore in my dying moments.&nbsp; And if I were sick, I would have all this time to try to act happy, to not cry in front of everyone so they would remember me as happy as I used to be.&nbsp; Now I am scared because it would mean that I am <EM>final</EM>.&nbsp; I will never seem them again.&nbsp; They will take old pictures of me and say, ""this was your grandma, she died when you were little, she was pretty neat..."".&nbsp; </P>
<P>When I was in nursing school the concept of death was something that I could not get my head around.&nbsp; When I did my clinical rotation at a nursing home one of my classmate's patients died.&nbsp; I remember going in the room shorty before the pt's death to take vitals.&nbsp; I remember the air in the room was so heavy, and the drapes were drawn, and the breathing shallow and slow.&nbsp; For some reason the atmosphere in that room stuck with me for a long time.&nbsp; I have never been one to claim any kind of spirituality or religous beliefs, but just spending the short 10 minutes in that room at the end of that man's life really made me start thinking that we are more than skin and bones.&nbsp; I could <EM>feel</EM> his life leaving him, I could <EM>feel </EM>whoever he was drippling out of his body.&nbsp; *shiver*</P>
<P>Of course, I really have no idea what I am talking about.&nbsp; It's all rationalizations, &nbsp;really.</P>
<P>My grandfather died in February.&nbsp; It was pretty awful, it felt like it was hard to breathe the whole time.&nbsp; I had to make midnight phone calls to everyone as I am here in Spain and they were in Sacramento.&nbsp; I was very sad...though we were not particularly close, I knew him as a fine man.&nbsp; I remember at my saddest point, my sweet baby crawled over and got in my lap and made a silly face and made me giggle.&nbsp; I suddenly thought that it's ok that my grandpa had died, because Catey was here.&nbsp; The whole circle of life thing.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Ugg, tears in my eyes.&nbsp; My mother accuses me of thinking too much, but I like to think of it as introspection.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

<P>There is a debate on my boards right now about wether mothers ""should"" ask for help after the baby is born or just tough it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Martyring to The Mommy Cause is a really good idea when you are hormones up the wazoo, you are leaking, crying, not sleeping and generally freaking out for the first 6 weeks.&nbsp; Seriously, who the fuck cares?&nbsp; Help is necessary if you think it is, simple as that.&nbsp; And you who had the easy baby...when you have a child that pukes all the time, has colic, doesn't latch on, is so clingy and scared that you can't take them out until they are 6 months old without constantly screaming, and wait, it get's better, has to be taken out of your body surgically after 3 days of labor therefore&nbsp;giving you the prettiest hip-to-hip scar you have ever seen, THEN AND ONLY THEN can you talk about how asking for help makes you wimp.</P>

Give me a fuckin' break. 

It seems to me that all the drama was in someway started by one person. 

Hmm...wonder who that could be?"

I feel like someone who has a parent who is addicted to drugs and they keep saying that they're sorry and that they'll change. 

My mom never really said she was sorry but all of a sudden she talks to me like a normal person and we get along and she wants me to move back in.  It's all so appealing.  I want to believe that it could be that way everyday but in my heart I know that it will never be.  

She will never change. 
So I can't go back.
And it sucks because I wish I could."

"event","21 days before my 21st birthday, I will begin the 21 credit hours that I signed myself up for.  Combined with the 30 hours of Pharmacy hell a week = one tired Danielle.

I may have wasted a semester at Columbia and one at Costco.  It needed to be done.  Now I'm ready to take it all on.  I'm not even worried about 21 hours of school and 30 of work because I know that I can do it.  Why? Because I want to.  I want to be done with this whole ""in between"" chapter of my life.  I want to ""grow up"".  I want a house with a Christmas tree and so many Christmas lights outside that the neighbors think I'm crazy.  

I think that I've always been a few years ahead of myself.  

I have all the classes set.  This next semester will be the hardest.  Next year, most of my friends will graduate.  I won't graduate until 09' because I messed around this semester but that's ok.  I did what needed to be done.  I paid off my bills, got my own health insurence, and generally lived an adult life.  

When it's all said and done, I'll be a teacher.  That's all I want."

Next semester I'll be back in full swing at Northeastern and if all goes as planned I'll be done in 2 years with my teaching certificate! I have so many amazing contacts through my Pharmacists, Barbra, she knows everyone.  That has been helping me a lot!  Barbra has been trying to convince me to take the PCAT, which is the pharmacy school enterence exam.  I know I could probably get a decent score on the test, but I'm not looking to go to school for at least 4 more years.  

Besides, I hate chemistry.

Mike's 21st birthday was a few weeks ago and I took him to Fogo De Chao which is this amazing Brazilian Steak house. It was fantastic. 

Other than that, I've been trying keep myself warm.  I hate the cold and winter weather. 

Well, off to do some laundry and homework. And get my Sunday soup...liver dumpling. =)"

"event","Sometimes you have to ask yourself certain questions in life...one of these questions is...

1.  Do I really love the person I'm with?
    This is a yes or no question.  This is not a ""maybe"" or ""I'll get back to you"" question.
This is not a question that should be answered with "" not really but I'll go on making my significant other think I do."" or ""MAYBE I'LL JUST MUMBLE IT AND IT WON'T MEAN I REALLY LOVE HER""

Now, everyone know that I've never been one to hold back my feelings on a subject that is close to me (in some way or another).  So it shouldn't surprise anyone that even though I'm far away, I still have to say something about the recent relationship issue.  

To Emily, you live you learn.  I'm glad that we talked today and as much as I would like to rant on here and call names in the opposite direction--I won't, because you said it best--we are better.  We are better than that.  You will be over this and soon the realization will come that there is no one better then you.  You were it, baby!  Liars aren't worth the time, energy and love you have in you and fuck anyone who is heartless enough to go on lying to you, one of the most caring and giving people I know.  You have sisters there and you have sisters here at home that are ready and willing to stand by you.  You and I are just alike, you'll forgive someday but you won't forget.  

We don't forget.


I so would love to keep going but I just don't have it in me."

"event","Yes, I'm alive!  I've been staying at Mike's house after moving out of my house (kinda) in hopes that things will get better between Mom and I. 

  Mike and I just got back from our 300 mile roadtrip to Cedar Point in Sanducky, Ohio.  We left on Monday morning and with the slight time change made it into Sandusky about 4.  After surveying the room and going to Sears to buy a comforter (always take your blanket with you on vacation!) we headed over to Cedar Point.  After 5, the cost is 24.99 so we decide to go on Monday night and come back Tuesday all day since there was a of coasters to ride in not too much time. When we got there it seemed like the park would be full since the parking lot was packed but surprisingly, it was practically empty and the longest we waited as a half hour! It was so fun. 

We headed back to the hotel thinking that we would go back the park the next day but it turned out the the weather had other plans.  When we woke up, it was really cloudy and the weather channel said thunderstorms were headed our way.  So we went the hotel lobby and got a bunch of brochures looking for something to do that day.  We found two indoor waterparks but decided to take a trip to a small island in the area, Put In Bay. 
 
We traveled about 15 miles to the ferry spot and took the 10 mile boat ride to Put In Bay.  It was the coolest thing. It all felt so foreign.  Most people drove golf carts because there weren't many places to park.     We walked along the ""downtown"" which was pretty much bars, wine tasting places, and shops.  Mike bought a shirt, I got some really good candy and we walked up the road about a half mile to a cave touring attraction.  We sifted for gems and fossils (like the little kids we are) and got soaked in the rain.  It was so much fun, just being on vacation on this little island that not many people know exsists.  From Put In Bay, it is about 20-30 mile water taxi ride to Ontario, so if we ever go back I would love to take a trip to Canada. We headed back the ferry and battled the storm back to  the ""main land"" and drove back to Sandusky.

We picked up some shirts at the Shirt Shack, Ohio's biggest suvenier store.  Then, went to Toys R Us to pick up a game of Monopoly.  Headed back the room and finished out our last night in Ohio.  I really didn't want to leave this morning but I guess that is life!

Back to work tomorrow a day earlier then expected but someone just quit and now I'll definently be working 40-48 a week.  Oh well, at least I'm learning and actually filling perscriptions.

Off to relax, study my pharmacy book and possible watch the first Pirates of the Caribbean"

"event","So, I'm up and can't sleep.  Perfect time to update you all about the life of Danielle.  

I'm starting Pharmacy work next week after many interviews, resumes, and online preparation.  Here's something that will scare anyone next time they get a prescription filled:  There is actually a form you can download online that you send into the State of IL. along with a check for 40.00 and they send you back a Pharmacy Technicians License,  this license entitles me to fill prescriptions, just not mix medications.  And of course, an actual pharmacist has to check the prescription before it goes out.  But no schooling is required, besides a high school diploma. Talk about insane...

Mike and I are doing awesome.  We're trying to plan a camping trip in the dead of summer so I won't be too cold at night.  He wants to go in the fall but I know I would freeze.  We're also going to Cedar Point in July, which is less than a month away!! I'm really excited.  Anyone who knows me well, knows I LOVE rollar coasters.  

Emily and my Big Bro stopped by for a few last weekend.  I wish they could have spent more time or gone swimming or something but it was cold and poor Emdawg was sick.  

I had a dream a couple nights ago that Kris Grill and I lived together.  We both worked a Target in the cash office and both drove a Monte Carlo.  Umm...do you think my sub-conscience is telling me that I want to be just like her?  Well, who wouldn't want to be I guess.

I participated in Relay for Life last weekend. It was so fun!  We all had tents and lots of food and did a lot of fund-raising for a good cause!  Mike's mom as well as my own mom are survivors of cancer so it was worth the walking late at night in the rain.  Mike's mom organizes the whole event every year and it certainly is a huge undertaking.  She is really amazing.  

Speaking of which, she was able to get us front row tickets for the Broadway show Spelling Bee, June 27th.  It's an interactive show so I'm a bit scared about the front row seats but it is still awesome!

On the music front, I went to go see Local H last week.  I really liked it.  We stood up in the balcony at the Metro and had a perfect view.  The opening band was Five Horse Johnson, which I wasn't too keen on.  But the lead singer of Local H did an acoustic set at the beginning and I really liked that.  

And Rich, you were right on again...I'm getting to Gnarls Barkley, especially Crazy.  At first, I really didn't like it but maybe it's one of those things that grows on you. I'm thinking about shelling out the cash to go to Lollapalooza...The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sparta, Gnarls, The New Pornographers,Queens of the Stone Age, The Shins, and Kanya West...just to mention a few.
As the website says...140$ for a 3-day pass...that's about 1$ a band. Still pretty steep.

Ok, I'm going to try to go back to sleep.  I want to get up early and go in the pool.  Plus, Jordan got a Nintendo DS and the new SUPER MARIO GAME and I don't work until 4 so I've got my afternoon planned out.  Mike and I played Super Mario Allstars two nights ago, which features all the Super Mario Games...I was in Nintendo Heaven.  


Goodnight...Good Mornin'"

My new way over priced purse.


And now, for some random Mike and Danielle fun:

We also went to Bingo last week at the Elk's Log.  I forgot my camera but next time I'll definently bring it.  We were the youngest people there by at least 40 years but as Mike put it, ""Where else are you gonna go for 6 bucks a person for 3 hours of amusement and a ham sandwich made by someone's great grandma""

We went to the Brookfield Zoo on Wednesday.  I forgot how much I enjoy going to the zoo.  
This is Jeffery, our new friend who almost ate out of our hands but the poor thing couldn't reach.

We also found some friendly little panguins who were close enough to touch but I was too scared.  And I didn't want to be a bad influence on all the little children around me by disobaying the signs.  But mostly I was just scared to touch him.

Then, we went to the dolphin show and sat close enough to get good pictures. Well, it turned out that we sat close enough to not only get pictures but get soaked as well.

Then I went to go see Wicked on Wednesday night but I don't have any pics of that. It was amazing.  I can't even discribe how good it was.  It was just...flawless.

We have a busy month coming up.  I'm looking forward to the pharamacy training soon.  June 9th is Local H at The Metro and Relay for Life all night.  June 10th is a pool/birthday party for a family friend at my house.  June 27th--Spelling Bee!  I love that Mike's parents  love the theatre so much.  They love that I enjoy it too and have been taking us to shows and buying tickets for us pretty often.  

I better get myself to bed.  Another 8 hour workday tomorrow. 

Night Night"

It was originaly 165.00 but I bought it at the outlet mall.

But it's a freakin' sweet purse!

HOLLY! It's a Dooney just like yours and I love it to pieces, just like I love you to pieces!
Oh well.  You have to do something nice for yourself once in a while. Needless to say, I won't been shopping for a while."

"event","There is something about a nice 5 mile walk that calms the nerves.  Mike and I decided to walk to Blockbuster and take back Kill Bill 2, which we havn't watched yet but was 2 weeks overdue.  When we got to Blockbuster which is about two miles away, we decided to walk a little further into LaGrange and do some window shopping. It was such a relaxing night.  All in all, we walked about 5 miles and decided we are going to walk to places more often. 

Something tells me that tomorrow I will pay for our little adventure but it was a really fun night.  We walked through Brookfield into LaGrange Park and looked at all the houses, yards, and gardens.  We looked at all the fliers in the for sale signs.  Houses are really outragous up here.  You can't touch anything in that area for less than 300,000.  

But anyway, as you can see my last post was an article from a newspaper in Chicago, called the Onion.  It is a publication to makes fun of everyone and everything.  There are no boundries.  It is easiely the funniest thing I ever read.  Mike bought me a ""best of"" the Onion book at Borders tonight on our walk so I decided I would share my new wealth with you all.  I'll post an article a day from the Onion.com.  And if you find yourself compelled, check it out. 


Peace out Beanspouts."

"event","Well, my first (and last) semester at Columbia is coming to a close.  But before that I have to get through my dreded History of Cinema final (at 6).  For the past few hours, I have been at the Hilton Hotel restaurant studying out on the deck.  I treated myself to a 11.00 cheeseburger and fries and even had a regular coke!  I think I'm prepared but this teacher is a total dickhead so we'll see what happens.


I start work at Costco again next week which means big bucks.  And I'll be traning for the pharm. tech position when the new store opens up in September.  

But do I really want to write off school for next year?  I mean, I'm pretty screwed as far as school goes  because I can't afford Columbia, I have all my gen-eds done so CC is out.  I have to get into a program somewhere cheap enough soon.  And if I don't...

Pharm tech job in Orland Park is mine. Full-time 16.00 a hour and benefits. I just let out a sarcastic ""yay"".

Get your hands on the Documentary ""My Date with Drew"" I just watched it and it is totally you!  This guy lives in LA and he gives himself 30 days to get a date with Drew Barrymore. He buys a camera from circuit city on a friends credit card and has to return it in 30 days to get the refund...but by pure word of mouth he actually gets a date with Drew.  

Anyway, the doc film thing is so much fun, and there is really a market for it.  You can make a doc. about pretty much anything and it is bound to be gold in someone's eyes.

Anyway, for sure get your hands on it..or if you have cable, I tivo'd it. I'm not sure why I want you to see it so bad but something tells me it might give you ideas for your own work.  The guy in it is totally you.

I hope everyone had a good day yesterday.  I worked at Lonestar from 4-10 but I went to my grandfather's house before work and we had some yummy eats, so that was good.

Mike's mom had an Easter Egg hunt for us and we had little presents with each egg, she is pretty much the cutest thing I have ever seen (except for my Upper E girls).  I made Mike ads Jordan an Easter basket and promised Jordan I would take him to Great America this summer. I think we are getting season passes because I love that place and it will be pretty much the only way to see Megan ever again! I can't wait to go!

Tonight we are planning our trip to Cedar Point in Ohio which features the tallest and fastest rollar coasters in the states. Mike and I are going the second week in July for a couple days, so that should be fun.

I didn't get to see Emily this weekend. ;/ but that's ok b/c she will be back for summer in like 3 weeks right??? You are coming back aren't you? I'm starved for girl contact...that sounded bad. 

Well, Friday we went to the Bulls game and I really enjoyed myself.  After last night's win to the Heat they landed a spot in the playoffs, hopefully we can get to a playoff game sometime. the Cubs game had some nice weather and not much else to be excited for...except 5.75 beers and peanuts.  But I still enjoyed myself.  True fans don't worry about silly things like winning. =)

Well, I have class in ten minutes about a mile away so I better get my butt going. I start training at this new restaurant that is part of the complex I work for on Thursday.  It is called Capone's and the menu is all in Italian.  There's nothing on the menu under 30.00 so no cheapos will be coming there.  ((Hopefully I can make enough this summer to pay off my credit cards AND go visit Sara next semester)) That would be greatness.

I've been at school all day but it is sunny and 66 degrees so I guess I can handle some education on a day like this.  Tomorrow the forecast calls for light rain and 70 degree temps.  I really can't wait.  It's such a welcome change to all this cold wind and freezing rain we've been getting over here.

Well, I started my job at the Bar a couple weekends ago.  It is majorly fun and is helping me pay off my credit cards, which I will have totally paid off by the end of summer. YAY!  They have these amazing cover bands every weekend.  Last weekend, there was a band with a girl as the lead singer and she was amazing.  I sang with her for half a song and it was really fun.  I love performing.  I got home at like 4, then went to Lonestar at 12-10.  I'm just a little worker =)

Mike is applying for the North Riverside Fire Department as well as Chicago. If he gets on to either one of them, we'll have def. an apartment soon after but maybe even a condo. He's really a good worker so I think he has a pretty good shot.  It would be so nice to live together and finally get out of the house for good.  

The weather has put me in the best of spirits today! I even walked over to Grant Park over lunch and read some of ""A Million Little Pieces"" by James Fray. It's really good, check it out!

Well, I have a storyboard to sketch out for 6 so I better get on that.

"event","It's been awhile since my last real update so here I am!  I've been doing a lot of thinking lately and I'm sorry to say that I will have to drop out of Columbia after this semester.  I just afford it.  It really is crazy that I can't, but I've be denied for so many loans in the last couple months.  I have a feeling that I might have had a chance on the last few if my credit wasn't ruined from the first 5.  Everytime you apply for a loan or a credit card, the agency will run your credit score...each time that is done, the score goes down.  So, if you're applying for a loan and are denied by the first few lenders, you're pretty much S.O.L. 

Ah well, such is life.  I spent the morning doing laundry and watching Dog the Bounter hunter. I'm so lazy...

I talked to Emily last night and that made me happy.  I'm really excited about coming to formal. I can't wait to see everyone. I really can't.

Well, back to my subject headline: 

Sara: In a perfect world you and I would be searving some rich stock broker martinis on his flight to Paris. We would be all smiles and maybe even share a little apt. because we wouldn't make that much money as flight attendents.

Emily: In a perfect world we all would have time to do EVERYTHING we wanted. Be it theatre, sororities, softball, or just hanging with our boys.

Karisa:  In a perfect world everyone knows what we want to say before we even say it and no explaination is needed.

KRIS:  In a perfect world you live closer to me damn it! =)

Rich: In a perfect world everyone has not only the chance but the guarentee to be as happy as you in sunny Cali.

Holly: In a perfect world you would never be sick, lonely, tired, overwhelmed, or sad in general.

We all deserve it.

In my perfect world, I spend my winters in Vegas, with a margarita in hand.  I have a great job that allows me to sleep in until 10, get up and head over to the set.  I live with Mike and I don't have to prove anything to anyone.  I'm not a disapointment, even to myself. 

But we live in America, the home of the American Dream.  Anyone who wants to go to college, can.  There is so much possibility.  Right. Stick it up your ass Bush.  

Now, I'm not usually very political at all.  But since my discovery of the Chicago Tribune, I have been increasingly informed in the ways of our governmental society.

As if the decreasing rate in finacial aid isn't enough, it is now planned that in July the rates of student loans will go up a whopping 3%.  Why is this? Perhaps because we spend all our money on wars and even better, something that not many people talk about: Our government has a system set up for corperations as well as students for grants, yes that is grants which don't have to be paid back, in 2005, The McDonald's Coperation was awarded over a fifty million is advertise chicken nuggets in Asia.  Isn't that fucking special.

Then, you have countries like Denmark which provide students with complete financial aid as well as a stipend for going to college.  Why? Because they actually realize that their young adult population REALLY is the future of their country.  The United States is one of the only places on the face of the earth that takes advantage of it's own people meanwhile, helping everyone else out. You have to keep in mind that Denmark is closed country, meaning they don't accept immigrants but is that really bad when you have free schooling, healthcare, childcare and get PAID to have an education.  And they only pay about 5% more in taxes.  

I wonder if there was a poll of what percentage of the population thought they actually could achieve the ""American Dream"" how the real people would respond.

It's not only the government that is screwing us as students.  It seems to be everywhere.  Please tell me why everyone is so optimistic about higher education and ""following your dream"".  How many people can you actually think of that have ""made it big"" in the industry they love.  Or better yet, how many people can even survive. Not many.  And it will be harder soon, with less financial aid, higher rates, and the average college student leaving college with about 50,000 in student loans and rarely finding a job that can help them pull themselves out of debt. In my opinion, there comes a time when you have to cut your losses and say ""F"" it for now.

So that's where I am right now.  Saying ""F-it"" to dreams for awhile.  Next semester I will be starting the 2 year degree program at Trition College for Radition Therapy otherwise known as ""X-Ray Tech"".  I know, exciting. 

But on the upside, if Mike gets into either the North Riverside or Chicago Fire Department full time we can start looking for a place.  Either way, we will probably end up living together by this time next year. No matter what, he the best thing I have.  And I know that he will always be there. So I'm no alone in this fight.  Although it sometime seems that way.

You know what else really pissed me off, Columbia College staff. Assholes.  I tried to call the financial aid office and it seems that everything can be solved by coming into the office.  Well, asshole, I live in the suburbs so why can't you just deal with me over the phone.  I'm so tired of ignorant people.  No one really cares for anyone else down there. You have look out for yourself.


But really, Rich tried helping me so much.  But you all know me...I'm too hard headed. Once I make up my mind, you can pretty much forget it. 

And I guess that's what I'm doing right now, making up my mind.

So, I guess I have a message in here somewhere to all my friends back at Eureka in regard to the past week or so.  Some of you are heartbroken, some happy, some confused, some feel alone.  But none of you are alone.  It might be hard right now but this is definently something that happens in life...maybe not in such close proximity all that much but it happens.  It sucks, it really fucking sucks...but the worst part is the change it could create.  No one likes change but sometimes things just happen that no one can foresee. I'll use Rich and I as an example because I know he won't care too much...If he and I were still together, I would stuck here absolutly miserable.  I'm in no position to move across the country. I would be here in the cold and with everything going on, it would definently not be a healthy relationship.  I would be an absolute bitch because honestly, I would be jealous.  Of everything, the weather, the city, the oppurtunities.  But, now our lives are seperate, what he does doesn't effect my life. So, I'm free to happy for his successes! 
In that case, the change is good. Rich is happier than ever in L.A and I have Mike here.  Soon, he will have a beautiful girlfriend and his picture will be complete.  

But think of what it took him to get there--to be completely honest, going back and forth between girlfriends, secrets, confussion, home drama, Target, and 23 years.  ( I hope you don't mind that I use you as an example but you are a success story)

IT takes a lot to get somewhere. It's never as easy as we would like it to be. Yet, we strive everyday waiting for the day it might be.  

Hang in there my friends. See ya soon"

2nd...Even though I had a great birthday, I'm a little pissed right now.

Wanna ask me why?

Well, I got really bored about 1 and I couldn't sleep.  I started looking at the myspaces of people from Eureka. 

Then I read a really mean little song that was written about Christel.  I know it is about her because it uses her initials and there is a comment about it and it is spelled ""Christel"".

I hate that people can be so ignorant and in plan english: A BITCH.

So here's to you, Katie Huizinga...a person I respected until just a few hours ago: 

You might think you are some hot shit on campus but I don't attend Eureka anymore so that doesn't mean much to me.  What means a lot to me are my sisters and my friends.  Cut the bullshit and erase your mean comments about Christel.  There might be some people around there that are intimidated by you, but I'm not. 



Other than that whole mess, B-day was good.  I spent most of the day going to animal shelters looking for Mike's lost dog,Payton.  But it was all for a good cause. Tomorrow morning there is an organized search through the woods with the Greyhound Angels. So I have to be up at 8, then work 12-9.

Love to my Eureka girls. Miss you.

"event","Last week I woke up with about a hundred tiny red dots on my stomach and chest.  I have been extremely worried and completely sick over this until today when I went to the Dermatologist.  THey told me I have pitoriasis rosea...which ends up being a non-contagous disease of the skin that USUALLY goes away with 2 months. 

I cried myself home.

I have a couple hundred very ugly and angry spots on my body, luckily none on my arms or face.  But there is a totally infestion on my stomach, thighs, chest, and upper arms.  They rang from the size of a pin hole to the size of a dime and they all are RED.  I googled it to see some pictures and luckly none of them look like me too much.  

But what if it gets worse... =(



what is pitoriasis rosea?

 

Pityriasis rosea, often misspelled (you were very close!) and mispronounced, is a skin disease, usually mild, that is quite common in individuals between 10 - 35 years of age, although it is not limited to this age group. Females are also much more likely to have pityriasis rosea than males.

The symptoms of pityriasis rosea can last anywhere from several weeks to several months. The first symptom usually is a characteristic skin rash, or lesion, on the chest or back region known as a ""herald,"" or ""mother,"" patch. This appears as a single, large pinkish, reddish, or brownish-colored patch that is round to oval in shape and slightly raised. There is usually a scaly circular center as well. Because of its appearance, the herald patch may be mistaken for ringworm which, in contrast to pityriasis rosea, is contagious, caused by fungus, and requires antifungal medication.

One to two weeks later, more smaller, but similar, patches will manifest on the trunk, arms, and legs. Rarely are the face, hands, or feet affected. Another characteristic of pityriasis rosea is the distinctive pattern of an evergreen, or Christmas, tree that the patches form over the back. Other symptoms may include some itching (usually mild), fatigue, and/or aches. As of yet, the cause of pityriasis rosea is unknown, but it has been suspected to be of viral origin, cannot be passed between individuals, usually does not recur, and is not indicative of any internal disease.

If you believe you may have pityriasis rosea, see a dermatologist for testing and proper diagnosis because your rash may be something else, such as ringworm, or a side effect of certain medications. If you have pityriasis rosea, the best thing for you to do is to patiently wait it out, especially if you have a mild case. If your case is severe, the dermatologist may prescribe treatments to relieve itching and inflammation, and possibly suggest ultraviolet (UV) light treatments, or moderate exposure to sunlight, to help promote healing and reduce itchiness as well. Avoid strenuous physical activity and hot showers, or baths, to prevent exacerbating the rash. And, if you have darker (than pale) colored skin, the pigmentation from the rash may take longer to fade; however, know that it will eventually disappear, with or without treatment."

"event","Well, it's been awhile I figured I would update!  I'm sitting here in the basement where my computer is located freezing my but off! There is so much homework I should be doing but none of it is due until Monday. (Yes, I'm still a slacker even at Columbia.)

So school... I love it! 
I have some really awesome classes. On Monday I have Marrage and Family-for a soc. gen ed. I need. Anyway, this class it taught by this 30-something woman who has lived in Jersey, New Orlands and now Chicago, so her accent is way cool. And to top it off she has been in a relationship for 8 years and never plans to get married. Good person to teach marrage and family. 

Then at 1:30 and I have Documentary and Social Change which is really interesting.  I love it how most of my film teachers are actually filmmakers.  My Doc. teacher has made his own documentary on the weathermen of the 60's and he was involved with several productions in Chicago including Hoop Dreams which is a really good movie. In that class we watch docs and respond to them...it is kind of long but interesting when you are wathcing films everyweek.  Im in that class til' 4:20

Then,I go eat dinner somewhere in the city yesterday, the meal of choice was Harold's Chicken Shack...a classy place let me tell you.

At 6 I have Developement and Preproduction.  The concept of this class is to stockpile ideas for Production 1 and 2. We watch films, talk about interesting characters, create characters and situations of own...just basically create ideas for our won future films. 

Then at 9 PM I drive home. I get here about 9:20 and basically fall into bed. 

Wednesday is not as cool as all that but it is still fun for the most part...I get to go to marrage and family again since it is only an hour 15 min. class twice a week. 11-12:15.

Then I have fun from 1:30 to 4:20 in math class...yay.

at 6:00-9:20 I have the history of film...which is facinating. We watch film clips from the early time periods starting at the first films in the 1890's eventually we cover over a 100 years of film.  

It is all pretty cool and I have promised myself I'm going to work hard.  Not only for me but there is a semester in L.A program. It seems like the coolest thing.  you could either focus on screenwritting, producing, or directing. This program wouldn't be for a couple years but I'm defently looking into it. 

ok, I'm off to do some homework and clean before Mike comes over. I love days off.


Miss you all.

"event","Last night there was a really bad fire in Cicero.  When Mike called me at 2:10 and said he was going to a fire call I didn't think much of it because he responds to calls all the time and they almost always end up being false alarms.  But I guess last night was different.  The next time I talked to him it was 8:00 AM and he was still at the fire. I guess he got there around 2:30 and they did a sweep ( checking inside the building for anyone still inside) then they went back out to get hoses and stuff.  Right before they went back in the Cicero fire chief told the guys not to go in.  So Mike got up on the ladder from the truck and sprayed from above the building. Less than 10 mins later the roof colasped.  Miek said that if they went back in to try to put out the fire from the inside everyone that was inside would have died. 
But on the bright side, everyone was ok. Except for one chief who feel on some ice early this morning.  It is amazing how face the water that controls the water turns to ice. Mike said his whole uniform and mask was covered in ice as he was spraying because it was about 10 degrees out last night. 

All this fire business has kept me up most the evening. I'm glad that kind of thing doesn't happen everyday but if he gets in the Chicago dept.  On the flip side if he did get on the Chicago dept.  we would be moving in together somewhere in the city. It is all up in the air but he wouldn't know for at least another year or so. 

Well, Lonstar is coming along nicey. I will have my first tables on my own tomorrow. It is hard to memorize everything you need to know but the money is really good so I did it as fast as I could. 

Columbia starts on Monday.  I scheduled classes for only Mon. and Wed. so I could work on the rest of the days.  It actually works out pretty nicely.  I will go to school from 11-12:15, 1:30-4:20, then 6:00-9:20 on Monday, Wednesday.  That adds up to 15 hours.  I'm happy with it for my first semester.  

One the teachers in my dept. and I were talking and I told him I was interested in production.  It turns out that he was one of the executive producers for Secondhand Lions and some other films.  His name is Kevin Cooper and he seemed really willing to help anyone who was dedicated. That is me!  Oh! AND there is this sign up sheet at school where you can sign up to be a P.A ( production assistant) for movies around town.  It turns out that they call almost everyone within a week because come on who wouldn't want and overeager film student to run and get you coffee for free.  But the coolest part is the fact that you would work on a movie set.  They tell me this business is all about connections. If you work your ass off as a P.A you can easily become more important as time goes by.  

I'm all about working my ass off...literally I've gained some weight since I got home.  But I a little diet this week. Not really a diet. THe basis is that I eat whatever I want but I only eat until I'm full.  I have developed a liking for Big Macs! How come no one ever told me about this wonderous burger before?! So I can have a Big Mac and a SMALL fry (which kills me by the way) and I'm full.  Plus all the running around as a waitress will help I think. I also went out and bought a new dance dance revolution game and I started that yesterday believe it or not all the jumping around is the best exercise I get. It is fun and that is how I lost weight last time.

Oh EMILY!!!!!! Have you been on myspace? Shannon is pregnant and it is not a joke! Isn't that crazy?!

I got a card from Holly ( my Holy Holly love) yesterday and it made me happy, it also reminded me of all the things I wanted to send out to various people ( I will try to get that out in a by the beginning of next week) Hey DZ girls..is there anyway I could get a list of dates for important stuff coming up? Thanks!

Sara, did you do a birthday list for you new floor, if so can you email me that to me? 
I hope all is well in Upper E and D. They are the best girls anyone could ask for ( well Lower E is the best too!) 

Rich called me from Vegas! Meanie head! He was standing outside the Belagio and I was standing the backroom of Lonestar but I could see it in my mind.  

Speaking of Vegas my grandma has been watching this 93 year old woman for about 6 months.  She gets paid a lot of money so the other day when she was over here we looked at trips to Vegas...We could go at my spring break March 28-31 for about 290 aperson and stay at a decent hotel.  I want to go so bad but I think I'm gonna tell her to wait til 07' when I can enjoy the city a little more.  

BTW my birthday is coming up! I'm pretty excited but I can't wait to be 21 already! 

Sorry this was so long. It wasn't intended to be.  I love you guys and miss you."

"event","Well well well, it has really been too long since I updated the masses on the wonders of my life!  Since my last post I have moved home.  Yeah, it sucks in a way but it's benifits far outway any stress that me living at home could create. First of all, I'm back here with my honey, MIKE. Second, I'm starting school again in a couple of weeks, third I get to see all my friends out this way again, and last but not least the financial situation.  

I started a new job,  Yes,my seasonal postiton at Costco has come to a close and as much as I loved being hit with carts by customers and my supervisors forgetting to give me a last break, I'm glad to say that it is over. (for now) But, in order to keep American Express, Harris Bank and various other financial insitutions in my life happy I have a new job at Lonestar! Yep, that's right you are looking at the newest waitress at the Hodgkins Lonestar Steak House.  And I'm pretty damn excited. 

What else has been going on...oh! X-mas.  I had a wonderful Christmas! I spent Christmas day and eve both with Mike and our families.  His family is nicer to me then my own.  They are all wonderful people and I had so much fun! Some cool things I got included: A ferret calander which I love to death, a bunch of fuzzy cool socks, a zip drive for school, Madagascar on DVD, the Motion City Soundtrack CD, a cute purse( with candy and dollar in it), rechargable batteries for my camera, a year subscription to Cosmo, a book about the secret life of sororities (and it mentions DELTA ZETA) all from Mike.  Then I got a Dooney from my grandma, some Uggs from my mom, a sweater, wireless internet for my computer, another calander, and some really cool uncut money from the US treasury.

All in all, it was the best Christmas ever because of all the people I had to share it with ( well on in particular) 

New Years was cool, spent it at Rob's. My mom decided at about 8PM that she didn't want me driving with all the drunk people that would be out so she said I should stay at Rob's.  Mike and I were going to stay on the first floor in the part of the house that is locked but with me tired and not drunk at all at 2 AM we just decided to head back to Brookfield.  There was this really bad accident that Mike jumped out of the car to help with around Stickney.  It was really bad but luckly I think everyone made it to the hospital in time. 

Well, that's about all that has been happening to me lately.  Except that on Wednesday I got strep and was out of comission for about 3 days but it was nice to spend some downtime with Mike. 

Well, I better get to bed, I have to go to the DMV in the morning, take my car into the shop, try to get my hair colored, and then we are off to the Bulls game tomorrow night.  

Wednesday is orientation at Columbia and I get to pick my classes. I'm excited/nervious. But I guess that is normal.


K, well I have made it though this whole thing without mentioning that fact that I miss you Upper E/ Delta Zeta/ Eureka girls (and guys) so much.  I know that it is all stressful right now with classes starting way too soon tomorrow, College Theatre Fest, High School Theatre fest, Delta Zeta, RA stuff, and everything else you have going on. But when things get too hard to handle just remember that it is all for a purpose. Everything that happens. Your time at Eureka will end too quickly. But the friends will always be there if you want them to be, right?  

Take a breath and try not to let it all get you down. 

Love you all. 

BTW ( this same post is on both myspace and livejournal so if on the off chance you are one of the people that read both don't bother.)"

From here on in I shoot without a script
To see what comes of it, instead of my old shit.
( At little RENT for you Karisa!)

Before I go on about how sad I am right now it is important to note that I think I'm making the right decision.  Life leads you in so many directions and right now mine is leading me home.

But I have to admit, tonight as I pack all my things.  As I throw away things I have been saving for no good reason I can't help but feel sad.  It is 11:39 on my last Monday night here at Eureka College and I'm about to make the trip home to share my room with Jordan once again.  I remember all the livejournal posts complaining about home and how my only solice was Eureka.  But now I'n leave family and friends here and going back to what once was the bane of my exsistance. 

I will be closer to Mike, which helps me a lot. But the tradeoff is leaving Sara, Emily, Karisa, Alex, Jonathan, Holly, Daryl, Carissa, Amyrose, Papesh, Miranda, Courtney, Beast, Jason, All of Upper D and the Zetas.  It is easy to say that I will come back all the time but how realistic is that? I will come back as much as I can but it isn't the same as being able to just walk downstairs to talk to Sara and it certainly won't be as easy to fight like the sister I never had with Emily. Sunday nights as much as I sometimes wished I didn't have to be in meetings will be a little bit more empty in my heart.

But all of these feelings reinforce my decision.  I'm sad to leave the people. I'm sad to leave my friends. I'm not sad to leave the school or the teachers or anything else about it. It is just the fact that leaving all these wonderful people makes me uneasy.  It is easy to say ""keep in touch"" and I hope that everyone does.

The last few night I have spent hanging out with Sara and I realized that I should have just walked down to her room a little more this year. I look back on some of the posts I have made and how depressed I was.  I  love you Sara, and I'm definently going to miss you bunches.  Take lots of picture of you and any my girls.  I know that you will be happy up here and they will love you (they already do!)

Well, a little talk with my BIG SIS has made me feel better...it is amazing what a little Kris Grill can do for a person!  I better be off to memorizing. 

Last dance
Last chance...

"event","How...im not sure. But yes, I'm sick again.  Yesterday it was a headache at about 2 or 3 that hung out in my room until about 2AM.  But I'm almost apt to say it was a mild case of the stomach flu because I felt sick to my stomach the whole time and at about 12 last night all the meds., food, and water I had been taking all day revisited me in the bathroom.  I haven't thrown up in a long time but I was really sick.  SO the headache stayed awhile after that until 2ish when I finally fell asleep.  I woke up at 6 from a call from Mike at the firehouse. I guess today was a busy accident morning in Stickney so he was there on a couple calls and the call to my cell phone wasn't meant to wake me but to lead him to my voicemail where he could leave me a nice message...

But needless to say it woke me and I felt great! I even got up and headed over o breakfast. I made myself a nice bagle samach...(not as good as a BIG samach mind you)... and walked back over to room before class.  I got here about 8:20 and laid down to watch ER for a while before class...when I openned my eyes it was 10:45 and I felt like shit again. Back into the bathroom for a visit from my bagel sandwich and I still feel crappy. 

Good thing Dr. Logsdon isn't really up with the times. I know that he notices I'm not there but I don't think it will damage me as much as it would in other classes. (cough cough Hemmenway.  Her final is tomorrow and I really don't even want to go. I'm going to but I know deep down that no matter what I do for the woman, it isn't going to be correct or good enough...just like everything else I do for her.

I was looking at all the pictures that are being post on facebook and I realize that I would have fit in better here about 1 or 2 years before my time.  There are so many people that are gone from last year and I just don't know how to deal with that. Karisa, you must be feeling the same way but you are too strong to say it maybe, I admire that.  But I just feel like my time with those people was totally cut short and this place just isn't the same to me without them.

Perfect example: Kris...my most wonderful BIG SIS.  Our time was cut short, for me at least.


I still have my Karisa, Sara, Julie-Rose and such to keep me afloat but the place that is in those pictures on face book: I want to be there.  That place just isn't here. It isn't anywhere I guess. 

I should have been born two damn years earlier.
But even then I would feel the same just about different people. 

I miss everyone.
I will miss everyone that is here even more.

I love you Sara, I hope you are sleeping right now but I bet you aren't...I had a mental break down tonight but I really did want to help you because you work so hard as it is. 

Goodnight from D at 12:49 AM.

February 5th we had our S2k meet @ the Dragon.&nbsp; I've had to do a ton of work to the sol (brakes, oil change, replacing some studs and MAJOR cleaning). And of course...Vday was monday ;) </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc size=1>I didn't expect to get anything for valentines day. I had been really busy with the sol last week and hadn't talked to Dan and I guess I kind of figured he was moving on. </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><lj-cut text=""and then....""> </P>
<P>I went to work on Monday and it was incredibly slow. It sucked so bad. I saw all these guys coming in buying Godiva and carrying Victoria's Secret bags and stuff and it was all in all a bit depressing. Then Dan comes in and I'm like wth?! I didn't know he was coming. He said ""let me see your keys"" i was like what? why? and Lisa (a woman I work with) was like ""shelbie, dont ask just give him your stinkin keys!"" So he goes outside and comes back in and we talk for a min and he leaves. I couldn't take it anymore. I lasted maybe an hour before sneaking out to my car to see what he got me. I had a lil teddy bear holding a rose (I swear that was the most perfect rose I've ever friggin seen. I'm drying it in my closet ;) ) and a bunch of candy. It was sweet. He told me later that he went to two different walmarts and Krogers trying to find my fave valentine candy (those little hearts that say stuff like ""be mine"" and stuff on'em) but he couldn't find any. It was cute though. The best part was I was totally caught off guard. How awesome.</P>
<P>Saturday at the meet went VERY well too. I had a blast. Heres some pics...</P>

Everything was going great...then Sunday night he calls me and he had been drinking a little but he talked like he was fine. I dunno maybe that had something to do with it, but anyway...he asked me if i wanted to hang out monday night. So of course I was like sure. So I go monday and clean up the house and get all ready and wait for him to call me when he gets off work. Which he does. Only problem was that he had forgotten all a bout seeing me that night and proceeded to apologize profusely. And I honestly think it really was just a mistake. So we talk and decide that since we're both off on wednesday (today) that we would get together. Which duh, of course I assumed we would go out tonight. Isn't that normal? Aren't dates especially first 'real' dates usually at night? Anyway...I find out last night that he wanted to go snowboarding with his friend Wade tonight at like 5 so he lets me know last night that we're gonna have to go out during the day, which just totally bums me. Because I had this picture of us like chilling at my house watching movies and stuff and whatever, date during the day just sucks. He said we could go get some lunch and chill and stuff but i was just so agrivated cuz he had already blown me off accidently then turns around and makes plans on 'our day' without talking to me about it first. I was so pissed. So he said ""hey, how bout I call you in the morning when you get up and we'll make plans...before you totally hate me"". He asked when I would be getting up and i said probably around 11 and he said ok i'll call you then and we'll make plans. It is now 1pm and I've still not heard from him. So wtf? He told me last night that he was very sorry and blah blah blah. But I'm thinking maybe he just thinks i totally hate him now and dont want to have anything to do with him. But that still doesn't excuse it. You dont do that shit, you do what you say you're going to do. He could have at least called and been like ""I dont want to go out today"" or something.

If you dont want to marry the person BEFORE they get pregnant...what the hell makes you think its going to be any better with a kid? It will only be worse. Kids are a lot of stress. Trust me, I KNOW this all too well. It just blows my mind. But oh well....not my place to say so I guess. I just found out that the wedding colors are black, white, and baby pink. Yea...at one point I wanted a winter wedding. Know what my colors were going to be? Red and navy. But black??? Isn't that a bit morbid for a wedding? Oh well, least I can wear black to the wedding now and not feel guilty. w00t! Actually talked to my mom about me having a beach wedding. She thought it was a stoopid idea. I &lt;3 her so much.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc size=2>I wrapped all of my xmas presents tonight! It was fun. I'm all drinkin some egg nog and bitchin bout things that have nothing to do with me. Talk about the christmas spirit! I'm becoming a lil bit of a scrooge. Or possibly not quite a scrooge, just a grump. Its just that everything has been annoying me 100x's more now for some unearthly reason. Imagine that.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc size=2>I've got to be at work at 6:30 in the morning which means I'm going to have to get up at 5:30 cuz the only way I'm going to be even HALF way awake tomorrow is if I take a shower. And theres no way in hell Im getting up before 5:30. Its going to be a pain in the ass to pull THAT off. Bleh. I'll probably be a few minutes late, but hey...maybe they wont notice. We dont open till 7. w00t!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc size=2>My dad told me tonight that he can't get me the one thing I wanted for xmas. Okay, before I sound like a spoiled brat...it was just a PS2 game. Silent Hill 4 to be exact...yes the one I've been going crazy over. Its actually&nbsp; not that big of a deal but I specifically remember he and I going to walmart a month and a half ago and me telling him ""oh look dad, theres only 4 left"". Now hes like ""im sorry shel, but everyones sold out of SH4"". He wanted to get me a jewelry box instead. *sigh* poor dad. bless his heart.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc size=2>I feel kind of good actually. Lifes looking up a little. I've got a lot to look forward to. Like being super bizzy this week, I'm working 4 days...all mornings so i'll get off early....me and brandi are going to a xmas party tomorrow night, i've got that wedding to do on sunday, xmas&nbsp;@ my dads, xmas @ my house, and I'd like to squeeze hanging out with Joe somewhere in there, and of course, my wonderful Linz. </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc size=2>So anyway! i need to be getting my happy ass in bed or something, so I'l post some of my most recent pix and call it a night cuz God knows 3 LJ posts in one day is beyond sane. =P</FONT></STRONG></P>

<P>I know I left you a voicemail but I just wanted to say a few things.<BR>If you're wanting/working on getting back together with your ex, its<BR>not going to upset me.

Please look at it from my point of view. I dont know whether<BR>to be agrivated because you're possibly trying to blow me off because<BR>you're trying to get back with your ex, if you're just wanting time<BR>alone possibly because you're stressed, or for some other reason.<BR>Needless to say, I would consider you a friend of mine, and I'm a<BR>little bit worried about you.<BR><BR>At this point, I dont know if i'll &nbsp;hear from you again. My best guess<BR>is you're probably talking to her again and probably thinking you dont<BR>need me because I will jeopardize you're relationship with her. All I<BR>ask if for a email, IM, phone call or something to just let me know<BR>whats going on. If you dont want to talk to me again after that,<BR>alright, but you owe me that much after weeks of talking every day and<BR>honestly liking you as a person and caring about you.<BR><BR>I'm not mad, i'm just disappointed because you're choosing to avoid me<BR>instead of being straight up with me. I would rather know the truth,<BR>no matter what it is, than go on not knowing why you're not speaking<BR>to me.<BR><BR>Shel</P>
<P>and here is the one from him...</P>
<DIV>hey,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;i'm sorry i've been avoiding you, but i just can't handle anymore stress in my life right now and after the way that you left the other night, quiet frankly it kinda rubbed me the wrong way, and i just cant handle things that that right now. i'm sorry that we met when we did on not in sometime in the future things might have been different, but i just really need time alone with myself&nbsp; to deal with issues in my life that i need to get straightened out and thats something that noone can help me with, this is just how i have always dealt with things and probably will be til the day i die.&nbsp;again im sorry for ignoring you i just needed time alone to decide how i was going to deal with things.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Note: if you're wondering how exactly i left sunday night....he had been text messaging this person...who i assumed was his ex (still dont fucking know who it was) pretty much the entire night....last 15 minutes i was there he puts his arm around me....i get up to leave just expecting him to say bye i'll talk to you later and he gives me a hug and a kiss....so im like ok wtf is going on...are you just playing with me or what...thats what was going through my mind...so he gives me a hug...we kiss...and i spun around real fast and bolted out the door. moreso because&nbsp; i didn't know what to think and partly cuz i was pissed. you dont go and text message someone in front of someone without saying SOMETHING about who it is. hello...i even asked him on the way into walmart (this being the second time he'd gotten a text message from her that night) if it was her and he never replied. so wtf was i suppose to think? anyway, i felt really bad about it on the way home. and monday night i left him a voicemail apologizing for leaving the way i did. </DIV>"

Rocky has been avoiding me since sunday...the thing is...get this...I see him sunday night...we hang out for like 3 hours like usual, things go good as usual, EXCEPT the fact that hes text messaging someone on his phone 2 or 3 diff times during that period. I go to leave, he gives me a hug and a kiss, and said be careful and that he'd call me monday after work. THATS THE LAST FUCKING TIME I'VE TALKED TO HIM!! What the fuck..ok i realize that a) he was probably talking to his ex b)if they're trying to get back together or whatever that i would pose a problem and hes probably not wanting to risk it but HOLY FUCKING SHIT we've talked everyday for the past like 3 weeks!!! we've hung out, talked on the phone for HOURS, shared our problems, and honestly i came to care about the guy...i liked him yea, hes attractive and all, but i cared about him. hes going through some rough stuff in his life and i genuinely cared. and here he goes...i've IMed him a total of like 3 times since sunday and hes not replied (one time he came back from idle to see who had imed him and then soon after went idle again) i've left him 2 voicemails and hes not called back and i just finished writing this email (will post) asking for a simple explanation. Honestly...i dont expect a reply whatsoever, but i sure as hell fucking deserve one. what i dont understand is he doesn't come off the kind of guy that would be like this at all. he was always very considerate, nice, and respectful to me. so what the fuck? All I have to say is, if this is what he wants, fine, it seriously doesn't bother me very much that hes probably wanting her back...i've already moved on and am currently talking to other people. i just feel like i deserve a fucking explanation. thats all. </FONT></STRONG></P>

Well NO SHIT they dont want to be over there...no one wants to be over there. But last time I checked, the draft was never reinstated was it? Therefore, those soldiers that are over there VOLUNTEERED to be in the military. When you join any form of military you're dumb to not think there may be the possibility of you going to war. Thats the reason we have military...for our protection. And no, I'm not being too harsh. I know many people that are in the military. Hell, my 34 year old cousin is getting ready to go to Afganistan for 18 months in a few days. Yes hes scared, yes hes not absolutely thrilled about going, but you know what?

If you dont like it...suck it up and pull your finger out of your ass. Support our country and be a freakin loyal citizen.&nbsp;I'm tired of the bullshit.

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc>We lost our store manager who was totally kewl. A woman that worked in china for YEARS got fired for stealing. We got a new big store manager and a new manager over my store. Everyones talked about quitting or retiring. And everyone has SOMETHING to bitch about.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc>Talk about a pessimistic pile of poo. Jeeze.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc>We did however get a pretty kewl store manager for my store. His name is David...hes not GREAT looking or anything but hes really nice and we've spent a lot of time talking. I'm guessing hes in his mid to late 20's and he has a degree in Fine Art; he paints and does a lot of kick ass photography. Hes a pretty kewl dude and hes fun to talk to, so i dont mind too much. Plus, he understands the whole ""not fitting in"" part when it comes to having a ""art major"" and not being able to have people appreciate your work. For example...he couldn't support himself painting or selling his photography because people around here dont appreciate that kind of thing. Same goes for me just on a different level...I'm going to have to move because people dont need/want someone to come and redesign their house...blah. But anyways, hes a kewl guy.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc>I went into work today to find a note to me and Travis saying: ""Thanks Travis and Shelby for leaving us no change and all the mess. We didn't have anyone here to tell us what to do with it."" Leslie left it from last night....WHAT A BITCH! omfg Travis and I were so pissed. First of all...we were busy as SHIT yesterday because we had to work on putting up our trees...they were absolutely dead last night and had nothing to do. Secondly...ALL of us have had shit left over from other people the night or morning before to do. TOUGH SHIT! you do it and get over it, none of the rest of us bitch and complain. AND LASTLY! You dont leave&nbsp;your fellow employees nasty smartass messages like that for everyone to see. Its VERY unprofessional and makes you look like a total bitch. If you have a prob with me you call me or talk to me to my face you dont leave me some freakin note...I was so pissed but whatever. She called back later saying over and over that she was sorry that she was just a pissy mood that night...wtfh ever...you dont do shit like that just cuz your mad. Its called being mature.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc>I gotta call at work saying we have to be at work at 8am in the morning instead of 9:30...add that to my list of wonderful joys of work.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc>Plus, I have 5 huge 3ft x 3 ft plastic bags of presale stuff sitting at work that'll be rang up on sunday. Its all of my christmas presents for everyone and some stuff for mom and dad. Talk about maxing out my card...they better pay that thing off ASAP. lol</FONT></STRONG></P>

The thing is...she says that I've dated some bad guys...which i have...i mean lookin at fuckin James! The only guy i've dated that she really liked was Matt and I met him at work. Pisses me off...she stereotypes EVERY guy I meet off of there whether we're just friends or dating. Its rude! I'm willing to bet the only reason she liked matt was because he lived here.

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc>I worked till 9:30 last night then came home and got ready then went and picked Brandi up and we headed over to O'Charleys. That place was pretty kewl, lotta college people. We met Lindsey and Carrie there and had some Marguirtas (green salt kicks ass btw). Then we headed over to 2nd Level around 12 and ended up having to wait in line for about 30 mins. Bleh...waiting in line sucks...</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc>2nd Level was alright. Lot of SKANKY girls there...ew...We all ended up getting harassed by nasty guys trying to all grind on us on the dance floor...bleh.

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc>Lindsey ended up feeling sick so we left there around 1:30 or so. Me and Bran went to Krystal cuz we had the munchies. Krystal at 1:30 in the a.m. kicks ass. I ended up getting home around 3:30 this morning. So that wasn't too bad, but I didn't get to sleep cuz I was on the phone/puter till about 6 and mom woke me up at like 12 to babysit the kids cuz she had to go bail my 40 y/o uncle out of jail who got busted for DUI for the THIRD time last night. Dumbass....so now hes going to jail for a year. Sucks to be him.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc>Aight, so get this...i'm going to dads today cuz he said he wanted to fix a dinner for me. Aw...well isn't that sweet...So, I was like kewl, I'll hop on over around 4.

I think its freakin nasty and i've thought this since i was like&nbsp;a KID...so i was like dad..you know I dont like that stuff...and he goes ""Oh, well you can just watch us eat then"". Mean ass! Supposed to be a dinner for me and they treat me like that...thats so mean. Whatever.

I had to be the oddball...apparantly I have a fat thumb or something and had a pain in the ass finding the right ball cuz the ones that are the right weight (10 lbs) have too small thumb holes...yea, I'm weird.

<LI><FONT color=#cc66cc><STRONG><U>Corey Feldman</U> totally sucks ass now. He went from being totally awesome in the '80s and being in movies like The Lost Boys (*gasp* &lt;3) to being this bleached blonde, animal rights activist, vegitarian loser! Booo! Yea, Corey, I LOVE animals! They're pretty damn tasty!</STRONG></FONT></LI>

<LI><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc><U>Vince Neil</U> would be awesome to have as a dad, and he has these kickass tiger stripes down his back. *growl* Hes pretty hot for a guy in his like 40's...</FONT></STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc><U>That chick with glasses from 90210</U> still wondering why they put her on there...she was so lame I couldn't remember her name.

<LI><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc><U>The other blonde girls from the first season</U> they were very cute. Especially the one that dressed up like a cheerleader for the talent show. But not kewl enough to remember their names...Oops..</FONT></STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc><U>Tammy Faye Baker</U> kicks ass! She reminds me of my mammaw. Maybe thats because my mammaw liked her...and we actually went to PTL when I was little...uhrm......anyways...shes kewl. She was in the middle of all of these totally drunk, sex-crazed people and she didn't judge them like you would normally think a teleavangelist would. Props to her. Hugs-N-Kisses to you Tammy Faye!</FONT></STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc><U>Vanilla Ice</U> has a skeery temper...I wanted to smack him a couple times. Especially when he called Tammy Faye a ""stupid german bitch"".

<LI><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc><U>Trishelle from The Real World Las Vegas,</U>&nbsp;ya know...she may be a drunk and she may act like a slut...but ya know, you gotta love the girl. Shes got that little southern girl charm and you just wanna pinch her cheeks. Even though you know that girl is going to end up in rehab one day or with a husband whos 25 years older who beats her with a bat after coming home drunk from bowling with the boys. YeeHaw!</FONT></STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc><U>Ron Jeremy</U> is a very hairy man. He refers to his penis as his ""Shmeckle"" and has been in over 1500 porn movies. He did seem pretty kewl though, very laid back. I still wouldn't let&nbsp;""Shmeckle"" get within 2 feet of me but still..pretty kewl guy. Even though he reminds me of Mario from the Mario Brothers...ya know...Nintendo? </FONT></STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc><U>Tracie Bingham</U> is a self-centered, plastic biotch. Totally disliked her. She complained about having an ugly colored bath tub and refused to take a bath in it or in the shower. *rme* Then proceeded to give the ""hard working black woman"" excuse as to why she deserved the right colored bath tub, not a <EM>raspberry </EM>one. Oh my... All I have to say is aye, Tracie...*raspberry*.</FONT></STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc><U>Eric Estrada</U> from Chips was a kewl guy. Very nice. Took care of Trishelle when she was piss ass drunk, and was laid back enough to joke around and have some fun. He'd also make a kewl dad. w00t</FONT></STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc><U>Gary Coleman</U> is a very messed up little man. He has anger issues and height envy. Total spazz...he sucks...(disclaimer: no, I am not prejudice towards ""little people"" Thank You)</FONT></STRONG></LI></OL>

cant stress about that right now...
why?
because :


So withdrawals suck.

Because throwing up is no fun.

or the shakes.

or the pulsing in my head.

or the sweating.

I'm going to cry.

"event","I can't be stupid..I have to do this right...

Can I give it up?

Can I walk away from my way of life now?

I changed who I was so I could survive through the break up.

Now that she's back can I fix me?

I'll try.
I promise.
I'll try my fucking hardest.
Just give me the chance."

What of the words she types? What of her recent confessions?
Am I riding head first into torture and massacre?
Why does she have to be so corrupted??
There is nothing I can do but believe
And give in.

I'm skeptical.
I'm afraid.
But I love her.

"event","I'm confused.
I think...
I'm not even sure...
Whats up with her stealing my drugs anyways?
Get your own drug.
Go smoke crack.
Its kinda fun.
I tried it before.
Go do that.

Well, fucking wednesday night was insane...popped four e pills....smoked mad weed....I was stuck lol....Stared at the closet for a long time....just at the walls...and the blacklight lmao....I've been rolling for days now....I've become incapable of feeling emotion unless I'm rollin...

But I can feel me missing her...
I can feel that...
I can feel that with such inhumane intensity...

But during all my rolls all the e pills...every roll I realized a piece of the puzzle...everything started coming together...

She's gone. She isn't coming back. No matter how much it hurts and no matter how much I want her t o come back I know that she never will. In my head I imagine her having sex with other people or kissing other people or other people holding her...that way I can get used to the idea of her and somebody else...because sooner or later...but probably soon....or even already...she is going to belong to someone else.

And that doesn't hurt anymore. Because I love her so fucking much..and its amazing...and I want her to be able to experience that...and then she can really actually happy....so I have to accept that she doesnt want to be with me.

I, on the other hand, will remain fully unable to be with any other girl...any guy....anybody...no relationships....and I'll never love again..I don't even get attracted to people...
Maybe some chick will come along and I'll want to bang the shit out of her and I'll have a distraction for a day or two.

Or maybe I'll never think about or consider another girl as long as I exist in this...oh so sad, oh so tragic, oh so sadistic world-- glazed with drugs, partys, and fast cars."

"event","The feel of her skin against my own was the most amazing feeling in the world.
Her kiss was perfection was magic just like her eyes just like her voice 
What we had or what I thought we had was something I hope everyone gets to feel.
I love her.

But what if she never really loved me back like that? 
I want her to be able to feel this, even if its not with me.
I want her to find happiness.
And thats obviously not with me.

I will never let her go She is always in my heart She always has my heart, its hers and hers alone.
But I accept that she is not mine.
I accept that she won't ever be mine again.
I accept that its over.

I accept it.
I accept it.

I love you.
Thank you because even though you killed me, you had every right to because you were the one who brought me back to life in the first place.
I lived for a while
And now my turn is up

I accept it. 
I accept it.

I will always be here for you.
I will do anything you ever ask of me.

I accept this.

This is really happening, happening.
This is really happening, happening.

I love you.

You are free."

"event","So...I don't know why I made another one of these...I haven't had one since like...11th grade haha...
But it seems like a good idea.
Maybe its just a piece of my life separate from hers. Pretty much everywhere I go online is somewhere she goes to as well, and then I end up dwelling on her profile, wondering what I did wrong.
Well anyways. I don't really have much to say lately, so I don't even know if I'll use this much. *shrug* whatever.
I do have one thing to say:

.I love drugs.
.Especially Ex-tuh-muh-see."

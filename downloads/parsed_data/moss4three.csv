"event","Ok, so at 42, coming up quickly on 43, I am seriously staring my greatest life fear in the face, having a child with a physical or developmental issue.  I can't put my finger on exactly why I am so damn frightened of this.  It seems irrational to me.  But, I am.  I keep telling myself just move through this, have another child, the window of opportunity is closing fast.  I hear a little voice in my head tell me to laugh the fear away.  This fear is deeply rooted.  Charlie has already said he does not want to have a child who, "" Has something wrong with it.""  What would he do if we did?  Do I go ahead and get pregnant and have all the testing I didn't have with Lochlann?  With Lochlann I only had a triple screen and a stage 2 ultrasound.  Then ""They"" told me that the triple screen is inconclusive anyway.  What a lot of worrying for nothing.  I now worry about how we would afford to care for a child with special needs.  This child would very likely need some sort of care after Charlie and I are dead.  Who will pay for that?  I want the whole family to embrace this child as they do Lochlann, but I just don't see the WHOLE family doing that, sad but true.  There are members of our extended family I can see shunning a child who has some issues.  Apparently I have a child/parent agreement with at least two other fragments to birth them as people who have physical/developmental issues.  Am I up for this?  How will it change my life?  Will it change Lochlann's life for the worse?  Will she not have as nice a life if she has to share me with a sibling who has needs that take up a great deal of my time/energy?  Will she resent me for having another child?  Am I being selfish wanting another child?  Will I have to have a child with physical/developmental issues in another life if I don't have one in this lifetime?  
This is mind boggling."

"event","Seems to have taken the best portion of my time.  So, no posts until today.  Lochlann is well.  She was dancing around to ""Walk like an Egyptian.""
While the Katrina disaster is very sobering, I am TIRED of hearing about it.  Everyone is trying to do their best to help, others are doing their best to get their lives back in some sort of order.  WHY DO WE NEED A PLAY BY PLAY???   I am pissed that Rehnquist died while W is still in office.  Gives him 2 nominations now.  DAMN.  We re gearing up for a hard winter here.  Oil prices are unaffordable.  We just are not sure what we are going to do.  Where we can find $750 a month to heat the house is beyond us.  It takes around a tank a month, 250 gallons, to heat this place.  At $3 a gallon we are hoping we don't burst any pipes.  Thoughts of taking a second job , but then who would take care of Lochlann?  We can not afford day care.  I refuse to have a stranger care for her.  It does not make sense to drive 45 minutes to take her to Mum's or Barbara's with the gas prices the way they are.  I HATE W!!  I am getting ready to sell my Hall Ware collection on eBay as well as random other things.  Nighty night."

She does not seem to be bothered by it.  So, we shall wait and wonder.  Kids get all sorts of whacky stuff when they are little.
She is smiling and playing at the moment so I am hoping the worst is over."

"event","Lochlann had a fever off and on yesterday, but it didn't seem to slow her down.  But last night it spiked again and she did not sleep at all.  She breast fed all night.  She is SO hot.  She just had diarrhea poop all over me. That is what I get for not putting a diaper on her.  Oh well, it was kind of funny after the fact.  She screamed bloody murder while I was washing her up.  Poor Poopy Lupina ( what we call her when she is poopy.) She hates being sick.  I am camped out in front of the ac with a sweltering baby adhered to my chest.  She just wants Mumma and her boobies.  One to drink from and one to use as a softy toy to hold and stroke.  Send her well wishes and good thoughts, the poor sweetie.  I hope she is better soon, we are supposed to go to Benton next week."

"event","Wednesday.  Only Thursday and Friday to get through then the kids and I don't have to schlep to swim class for Sebastian on the bus!  THey hate waiting for the bus and have a hard time understanding why we can't go to the play ground now like we used to when swim classes were later in the day and we had a 45 minute wait for the bus to take us home.  Tomorrow I am going to be super organized and pack a picnic lunch as well as bathing suits for Lochlann and I so that after Sebastian's swim class we can eat lunch then play at the park while we wait for the 1 pm re-opening of the pool.  Kind of a treat for a summer of wonderful behavior while schlepping through the heat on the Manchester Transit Authority bus system.  Friday we are taking them to an Audubon center camp fire tales gathering.  They have a camp fire, roast marshmallows and tell stories!  The kids will love it.  I hope it is not too damn hot for a camp fire.  I hate the heat.  I can't imagine living anywhere hotter than this.  The poor cats make themselves flatter than pancakes on the cool ceramic tile floor and lay there all day.  Our damn electric bill was 98$ for last month.  Heating or cooling, they charge a damn arm and a leg.  We have newish windows too...I guess we'll wrap them in plastic shrink wrap this winter anyway.  I have to make some of those snakes to lay across the thresholds of doors and windows as well.  They help block the draft.  We had the furnace damn near replaced last winter, so it should burn well this year.  I am afraid what oil prices will be like this winter.  We are looking around to do a prebuy but who has several thousand dollars up front to do that?  Not us."

"event","We had a nice Fourth of July.  I worked the 2nd and 3rd.  On the evening of the 3rd I hightailed it back to Manch-vegas to meet Charlie, Lochlann, Barbara and Sebastian at Marguertia's mexican restaurant.  We were able to stroll out side after dinner and sit on the sidewalk to watch Manchester's LOVELY fire works display.  But it was late late when we finally got to bed.  Sebastian slept over.  We didn't wake up till around 9 am Monday morning.  The kids were disappointed since we had talked up the Horribles parade in Andover, but then slept through it.  All in all it was a nice day though.  We went to Mum's even though she was not home.  We pulled up the nasty rubber carpet padding she had put down under the play gym in her backyard.  Both Barbara and I had told her we didn't want that stuff laying there off gassing and taking eons to decompose all the while dumping toxic waste into the ground.  I took the kids to the park we used to go to when we were kids.  We even went the back way like we used to.
While we were at the park, Charlie and Barbara re-landscaped the area around the play gym and put it together better.  They also spread some bark mulch around the base of it.  Now the kids have a nice place to play at Mum's house."

"event","OK, so now I have a blog too!  Sebastian, my nephew, graduated from Kindergarten Wednesday.  I went to support him.  BUT, I think it was way overblown.  I mean it is kindergarten for christ's sake.
Why do they need the whole shebang with tents and tables of food and a dj???  I don't even think the kids were into it at all.  They were forced to perform some songs and you could tell their hearts were not into it.  Then the feeding frenzy began.  It was disgusting.  All of the food had been sitting out in the hot hot sun from the beginning of the event on.  So, we went, Lochlann and I, to show our support for Sebastian.  He has had a time of it this past year with that school.  We are going to try home schooling now.  Public school SUCKS!
Time to go do a load of diapers while Lochlann is still sleeping!  10:49 am and she is still asleep!"

So, dad and I were talking, he FINALLY told me what's wrong. He's got Congestive Heart failure. He tells me this now, when he knew for ages. There's trust for you. He's worried about more life insurance and stuff like that, doctor's say he's only got a few more years. Please, I wouldn't be surprised if he outlived me.

Either way, I got him to agree to go to the peach festivle with me tommarow. I can't spell. But then I have to work tonight, tommarow night, and the night after that. Woot. Well, I'm working with Mike tonight, so it shouldn't be too bad. 

Peaches! Who has my yearbook?"

It's gross, disgusting, and I hate it. The people creep me out. There are bugs. Lots and lots of bugs. Most people figure I'm about 25, which doesn't make me unhappy. But everyone also assumes I smoke, which I don't. Next person that asks me if I want to take a ciggy break with them will get a ciggy right up their broken nose. 

There is a two-way mirror into the managers office. But it's a shitty one, it only looks like a mirror when the lights are off on the inside. When someone's in there, you can see them perfectly. 

There's a bunch of old regulars called the Coffee Drinkers. Three guesses why. They can't remember my name, so they started shouting for me across the resteraunt, ""Pocahontus!"" So guess what my name is now.

There's a kid there, my age, who asked me out. I'm like umm...hell no? Fuck no? Get away from me or my heel goes right up your ass no?

Nothing else new. See you all soon. I love you all lots and miss you terribly. Think of me because I'm selfish and want to haunt your lives!"

Been working a lot. Working again on Sunday, so I have a few days to myself. I trained for one day, then they put me on the floor. I so wasn't ready, but whatever. I made 15 dollars two nights ago in tips, and tonight I made 42. Last night. Whatever. Nearly got picked up by this guy who, when I said no, called a hooker. And yes, she was a REAL hooker. Apparently her boobs weren't though. That's what I picked up from the napkin they were writting on when I bussed their tables."

Don't you just love it? The whole book is full of poems like that. I'll use another one next time I update. Oh, yeah, my update! Great news everyone! I have a job interview tonight at 9:00 with this Daniel fellow. I hope he's old and bald and ugly, that way in my own mind he won't be judging me. And if he is judging me, he'll be comparing me to himself, and then I'll get the job! Very bad, but yes, true.

Another thing, was watching Good Morning America this morning (I know, it's a suburbian housewife thing) and they showed this book that looks great! It's called ""Real Style"" by Sam Sabouras and from the excerpts I've read, it's great! I'm going to go take it out today. Go to the GMA website and read the excerpt, it's great!

So as to my job, I'll be working the night shift. I'm so excited, even though it's right off the highway and a lady who used to work there says it's all drugdealers and drunks. I don't care, as long as they tip! Actually I think I prefer drunks, they won't know if they're throwing down a single or a twenty for tips! Low cut shirts!

In other news, I have a bit of a cold."

"event","So this morning I ran out of stuff to drink. Dad had some vodka and tonic in the shelf so I said Okay, have one. At least it's something to drink. Well, after that first one, I was tipsy. Dizzy to say the least. I thought to myself hmm, what happens after two? So I had two. And three. And four. And five. And six. In the middle of the seventh one I started feeling ill. So I went to take a shower, hoping you know, showers cure horny guys, maybe they'll cure my drunkeness too. Well, I barfed. In the shower. Several times. Then I got up and threw myself down in bed. That's the last thing I remember. I woke up at about 1:20 and had some KoolAid. And then I came here, at about 3. I am still pretty dizzy, though. Sorry for calling so early Tabitha. Several of you have messages from me on your cell phones. I'm not really sure which ones. I can't actually remember."

Okay, does anyone know when the yearbooks are comming out? I want to get a Carmel yearbook and have everyone sign it and mail it back to me. So could someone tell me when yearbooks come out and how expensive they are? Thanks.

Umm...oh yeah. Brit and I went to see Star Wars on Friday. It was great, I cried at the end. We also went to this kickass chinese resteraunt in the Dutch Mall, and omg the soup was to die for. Literally, it was amazing. I've never tasted soup that good anywhere! ANYWHERE!! So, yeah. Orgasmic soup. MMMMMMMM.

Not much else is new. Working for that psycho-lady with the tanning bed. Like the tanning bed. Really want to play poker, but everyoen seems to love BS. So BS works, I guess.

""Hi, this is Megan. Who is this?""
""Hello Megan, this is Jenn. Are you the one with the babysitting flyers?""
""Yes I am.""
""Can you babysit tonight?""
""Sure, until what time?""
""Seven AM tommarow."" 
So I'm thinking that I can catch the bus at 7:30 and it's all good. So I go over there and the mother's getting ready to leave, and she hands me a bottle. ""Oh, by the way, here's some good lotion, the tanning bed is in the back. Help yourself after the kids fall asleep."" Man, that was fun! I got paid to use it too. Andthey want to hire me all summer, free use of the tanning bed. AND they got pulled over that morning, so I had to miss school.

That, and I ran my phone bill up 300 bucks so phone is history."

Okay so we got our progress reports today (they're called Interums down here) and here are my grades. AmHist HON-95% English III Hon-85% (but will go up when I make up my one test) Chem-86% and Sociology-92%. I'm amazing! I'm also in the dumbest state in the nation, so it's kind of pathetic, but anyway...

MY DADDY GOT A NEW JOB! MY DADDY GOT A NEW JOB!!! And he likes it, but he wants more. So, he's got another interview tommarow! And he went to the doctor AND he got the meds he needs so he won't be sick anymore. 

That, and I've got a 3-day week at school. I love life."

"event","Saturday morning cartoons. Is there really anything better?

Okay, so yeah, after I finish this entry I'm going to Fatz to hand in an application and meet the manager and all that shit. Really, really nervous. I hope the manager is a girl. Truth be told, I feel a lot more comfortable around men, but I think I'd be a lot more comfortable working for a woman. If she judges me, then I can be like ""But we're the same!"" Or...yeah something like that.

Didn't sleep at all last night. Woke up at 2AM and vaccumed the house, took a shower, did the dishes, watched The Mummy. Yeah...one glass of coke at midnight, and then I never sleep again. What an unfair world.

I named my stuffed owl Maxwell.

Got in a lot of trouble over my phone bill...60 bucks over the limit. Damn you Mellie. 

There is absolutely nothing new. The pool is opening soon, and I left school early yesterday because of junior/senior cut day. Yeah..that was it. Nothing is happening. My life is so boring.

And yeah, that southern serial killer thing is an urban legend. Sorry, Morgan.

I want this job so freaking bad. As soon as I get a job I get a car, then I get a bathroom set, then I get some fucking clothes. I want clothes. Lots of them. Hot shit clothes. I love clothes. Make me pretty.

Oh, by the by, I'm on a diet. As soon as someone drops the word diet (GASP!) they all think that the person who says it is on some sort of self-hate rampage. Well guess what? I'm not. I just wanna lose weight is all. Dieting does not have to be some forced, evil, last-resort thing. You can do it just because you want to, not because you need to. Which is what I'm doing. 

I still have to call Jessie, I keep forgetting to do that. Bummer, sorry love. Will call today, I promise. 

I want my CD's...I wish I knew where I'd lost them. And I'm dying to play The Sims, but my computer got wet when we moved, so that little effer is fried.

Like Chicken.

PS)
     Is it bad if I sing ""Part of that World"" in the shower every night?"

"event","Glen, sometimes I love you. Okay, the Jesus in my quote is not the Mel Gibson Jesus. It's a kid on my team. His last name is Jesus. I'm dead friggin serious. And everyone's like ""Dude, no one's ever going to touch you, man. Who's gonna beat up on Jesus?!"" Speaking of which, he's getting back from Puerto Rico this Saturday, I need to call him...

Oh, yeah! Today I'm putting in applications at Fatz, the book store, and the Crab Shack. I'll probobly bus tables (if they hire me, which I doubt. My resume` sucks b/c I've never had a real job. No where to work in Stormville!) I'm going to Fatz and noon, and then walking to the Old Mill. I need a job, and I need to kick Alex's ass. He promised he'd get me 'in' at the coffee shop. He's a dead mo, I got news for ya.

I wonder if Amy will go see Sin City with me next weekend? 

What else, what else, going clothing shopping tommarow...going to Little China tommarow, really excited about that. I hear the food is FRIGGIN awesome!

I haven't gone down another pant size yet, but the ones I'm wearing now are getting kinda loose...sometimes I just love life.

As you can probobly tell, very little happens in South Carolina...

OMG! I NEARLY DIED THE OTHER DAY! WALKING MY DOG AND ALL THE SUDDEN, SIX FOOT BLACK SNAKE ON A TREE REARING AT ME! Mel was on the phone with me when it happened. I screamed like a little pussy.

Oh, did I tell you all this story? Megan McManus will love this one. I was walking my dog along the path next to the creek, and there's nothing there but woods and creek, so I usually let her off the leash. I did, and I was swinging the leash around and whooooshhh! right into the creek. So it was on the bank, and I could reach it. I start down the bank when, it gives way! It was just leaves piled on a huge ass rock, so I slipped down and right into the water, and it was deep. I was totally submurged! I break the surface and I know I screamed, that was some cold shit, and I grab the rock, clinging for dear life. (dramatics dramatics) Then something feels weird. I look down, my sandals are gone! And I see them, floating down the creek, ne'er to be seen again. While I had to walk a mile home with no shoes. Then I got the flu. Jake thought THAT was really funny. He also thinks that Mellie is a lesbian. 

By the way, my new ringer, for all the girls on my list, is ""Like a Virgin."" For the boys, it's ""Will and Grace."" Just thought you all should know.

Mellie, you've got the best singing voice! I play it on my phone over and over!!!

Gotta go put in job apps, so scared!

"event","Okay, wow. So we had a game last night-what a disaster! We lost, by two, actually it was a damn awesome game, but the refs! OMG! You know you suck when both teams hate you. I got an interferance for standing in the front of the net with my stick on some guys balls! That's totally legal! Jake got 3 penalties, I don't know what for, Vin got one for umm...fighting I think, and I know we had others, but I can't remmeber them offhand. I think Will had one, but again, I cannot remember for what.

So, remember like two games ago when I messed up my shoulder real bad? Middle of the ice, well on our blue line actually, this ASSistant comes up and hits me, and his little buddy comes up and pummel's me at the same time, I got sandwiched! I was like WTF mates?! And the ref was like ""Hey bitch, get off your ass."" Even Gerry was swearing at the refs!! I yelled at Jake, too, I told him to stop sugar-coating things for me and to just blame me when I fucked up. I felt really bad afterwards, but what was I supposed to say? Anyway, all in all it was still a fun game. We might have one if we'd been a little lucky and the refs hadn't have blown. I know, I know, you're not supposed to blame the refs when a game goes bad. I usually, almost never do. But BOTH teams hated them, I mean these guys were fucking awful!!!!!! Oh, haha, so last night after the game, I'm in the shower, and Jake F. is on one side of me and Nick is on the other, and I hear someone come in, it was Vin. He's like DUDE! THEY'RE NOT LETTING US OUT! THEY'RE GONNA FIGHT US! It was the other team, duh. So I get dressed real quick, but Jake and Nick are already gone, I mean those fuckers flew. So I come out, and walk right into Jake Wyrick. He tells me what's going on, and I run back into the locker room, grab my clothes, and run back into the bathroom. Jake tells me what so-and-so told him while I'm changing and he's taking a piss, and apparently the whole team wasn't going to let us leave until they beat the shit out of us. So suddenly I'm like OH CRAP! I forgot to give Chris (water boy) my jersey. His mom washes them between games. So I run into the other locker room (there were two b/c they were so small) and then run into the big one, and Chris is gone. I'm like AWW man, so I go to run outside, and Vin shouts ""NO MEG! THEY'RE GONNA KILL YOU!"" and I'm like oh please, they aren't going to touch me. So I run oustside, but I don't get into the main lobby b/c I find Chris. So I go back to my room, and then my team is like OK, we're going out there as a team. I'm like fuck, I'm NOT missing this. So we go out there and....they're gone! LITTLE PUSSIES! So, yeah, that was fun. Then we all went out to Taco Bell, and I'm sitting next to..god who was I sitting next to...brad? No, I can't remember, but across from him was Glen, and across from me was Jake, and next to my other side was the wall. So this girl stops by the window, waiting to go through the line, and Vin goes ""Hey Glen, flash her."" and he won't. So he says the same to Nick, who untucks his shirt, walks over to the glass and presses his nipple against it!! Oh man, we were fucking rolling. Glen was like ""Damn, dude, NEVER dare Nick to do something. He always does it!"" That just made my night.

What else happened? I had my English test, yeah I failed that. Not because I did bad, but because it's an honors class and I did mediocre. And...god I can't think, but I'm sure there was something else. Mellie, CALL ME! I have to talk to you about the you-know-what. How does $203 sound for you? That's BEFORE we split!!! I'm so good, I'm so sexy, you know you want me!

Henry called me today while I was flirting with the guy at the flea market. I was like WTF cause he called me last night at 1:40 on Megz's phone. But yea, that was fun. Hi Henry! Oh, and there was a guy selling chickens and goats and the like, but I mean AGH!! They were packed so tightly together. I wish I'd have given him a peice of my mind.

I've gone down a size! ::does a little dance, makes a litle love, gets down tonight, do do de do, gets down tonight::"

"event","Finally freedom! It's been so long for me! How is everyone? I'm doing fine! Playing hockey and the like, loving it! So I'm at Lexington now...get this! They have tractor day, where everyone drives their tractors to school, and I saw a kid with no front teeth! What the hell!? Jake was telling me that people don't even believe him when he talks about this place. Do ya'll (hehehehe!) believe me!? Of course not! But whatever! 

So I sit with Jake and Matt and Courtney and Julie and some other kids at lunch. Oh, and everyone on the hockey team makes fun of me! 

Get this! The other night, I was on one knee, watching Will shoot and Jake was right next to me and Matt (goalie coach) was on my left and he sneaks behind me and trips me! So I slash him, and then Jake comes behind me and does it again! I was like AHH BASTARDS! I'm gonna get Matt back, just you wait....

Yeah, they make fun of me a lot. For falling, cause I'm clumsy, for having huge ass bruises on my legs from blocking shots. Do you know what Matt said? He was like ""Meg, just say no."" and the whole room breaks out laughing! I was like hey jackass, up yours. Go fight with your fiancee some more. Huh? Yeah, what now? 

I guess my real friends now are my hockey team. Jake, Brad, Trevor, Austin, Will, those guys. They've been so great. I miss you guys, though. I was missing NY a lot recently. There's so much different here! Like today, it's 80 degrees. And I went to 12 mile creek yesterday, the water is always brown or dark. Not because it's dirty, that's just how it is. I told Misha that the water up north was crystal clear, you could see all the way to the bottom, and she didn't belive me! The other thing is that there's tons and tons of crabgrass here. I miss that nice soft mossy grass you could lay in for hours and always be comfortable. Lilacs, I think I miss those more than any other little quirk. Not that you have lilacs now, but...well it's warm here, so it feels like June, maybe May to me. I'm going to die this summer.

Speaking of this summer, I'm going to try and see if you guys can come down here! Wouldn't it be great? We could go out to the beach or boardwalk every night! Randy, you and Jake could go surfing! He surfs, apparently! 

Guys I miss you so much and would give anything to spend a day with you. Feel free to call me, I'll talk to you all whenever. Love ya lots!!!

I had a pen explode in my mouth and two 90 minute tests. So, yeah. School was horrible! But after school! Okay, here we go...I GOT THE APPARTMENT!!!!!! And we won the game! It was so fun! 

So, here we go, Jake and I were partnered together, which thrilled me because him and I just kickass. At least, I think so. I like working with him because I can always read his moves. We get along together. So, he said something, and I was like I won't answer so I don't start a fight. And then I was like but, between you and me, yeah. But...I don't really wanna answer. And he was like ""Hey dipshit, it's rhetorical."" And I laughed and apolgogized. I apologize for freakin' everything, but whatever. And we won, and him and we were like WHOOHOO and I hugged Trevor and Austin and Dylan. We were all so happy!!! And all the guys were like ""Okay, time to go to hooters."" And I was just ""Yeap, have fun. See ya on monday."" LOL! 

So me and dad and zane drove with Vin and his father. And I fell asleep, well we all fell asleep, and apparently I fell on his shoulder, and then his head fell on mine and he squished me and he woke up, but I didn't. So he had to tap me on the ear and drop my head on the seat to wake me up. Yeah, THAT was weird.

"event","Okay, quick little entry. I know I don't update much, but it's hard for my stupid butt to get to the computer. We had two games this week. Both were very eventful.

WENDSDAY GAME:

We lost, and we all got really mad at each other. So mad, that Matt ran across the room to fight Dylan! I grabbed Matt, and pushed him away, and scolded both of them. Yeah, points for girly balls. 

FRIDAY GAME:

This game was in Charlston. Yeah, we lost, it was embaressing as SHIT! Anyway, the day before, Vin stopped me in school and said he might need a ride. I told him to call me. He never did, so I just went there with dad. Halfway there he calls me and asks when I'm picking him up. I told him I'm not, and he curses me out and hangs up. He got there eventually.

So the game totally blows, right? I ask to be benched because I'm crying I'm doing so horrible. Then I get pissed at one of my coaches, and I FLATTEN this kid. I mean I floor the little bastard. Turns out I did a bit too much. I broke his collar bone.

TONIGHT:

I'm working at the Ice Arena with my team, then we're all going to an Inferno game. Go Inferno!!"

"event","I was today renewed in the idea that hockey is a beautiful thing. Especially when your feet don't hurt as much. But I mean, you skate, you play, you move with four other people, and it's just...so simple. So sweet. And it was so fun!

A few days ago, we went on the ice after no one had touched it all weekend. The lights were also off, so it just sat there....even though it was sand-based, it was so hard. A little peice of heavan! 

Oh, and today! Today was great. We had to do pushups, and Jake was doing his next to me, omg I just wanted to sit on him. Lol. I don't know why. He was just going up and down, his whole body stiff as a board, and it just looked so funny. I don't mean this in a sexual way, it was just so cool. Then, we had to do them again for cooldowns, and the forewards and defensmen did them alternating, and we had to stay in the up position while the other group did theirs. Jake and I did ours, and then we had to stay up. We just looked at each other and shook our heads, then just laid down. We're so damn lazy!

So, yeah, then we're comming down the stairs to the locker rooms and he's like ""Meg, what school do you go to?"" ""Ridge-something."" ""Ridgeview?"" ""Yeah."" ""Don't worry, Meg. I don't know what I school I go to, either."" ""I just got here!"" ""I know, I'm teasing."" ""Sheesh, makin' fun of me...""

Oh, and he's got his ear peirced! I know, everyone's like ""That's so last year!"" But I think it's hot! It hints at a bit of that wild side. Oooooooo baby!

Broadway is my nickname for the locker rooms because they all have these hot mirrors with lightbulbs all around them like they have on broadway. So it's broadway. There aren't many good looking guys on the team, not that I had time to look. I'm the worst of the best line on that team. It's really not that hard. I'm nervous as hell though, because we have a game against the MENS LEAGUE next week. As in men, like......men. Not boys. Big and strong and kick my ass-like. Yeah....I'm toast.

We start at 8:30 everyday except Wen. when we start at 9:30 and get out at 3: something. Periods are 45 mins long, but academics are for one semester, 90 minutes a day. Luckily my lunch is between Math1 and Math2! I'd go insane! Besides, my math teacher is really monotone. I've met about 3 people. Jamie, the ghetto girl behind me in AmHis. She's really awesome, has a huge accent. Then there's Ashley and Mike, both in my Math class. Mike has an orange mohawk, and we had an argument about cats today. 

What else, what else...got my room almost set up. Uncle George put up new shelves for me today. I'm putting up my favorite books and stuff. Dad keeps being an asshole, but I mean come on! What else is new! Dinner's almost ready. Southern' cookin! Whoohoo! Speaking of which, all the teachers told me to buy lunch on fried chicken day. Oh lordie....heh.

I miss you all very, very much. I'm sorry I can't send emails yet. Just not enough hours in the day. Give everyone my livejournal name who doesn't have it please. I have to go, talk to you all soon. All my love!"

"event","I know the quote doesn't fit the entry, but I found this, and I had to delete it from my disk, but I wanted to save it. It's so touching. I support the United States of America.

Twas the night before Christmas, he lived all alone, 
In a one bedroom house made of plaster & stone. 
I had come down the chimney with presents to give 
And to see just who in this home did live. 

I looked all about a strange sight I did see, 
No tinsel, no presents, not even a tree. 
No stocking by the fire, just boots filled with sand, 
On the wall hung pictures of far distant lands. 
With medals and badges, awards of all kind 
A sober thought came through my mind. 
For this house was different, so dark and dreary, 
I knew I had found the home of a soldier, once I could see
clearly. 

I heard stories about them, I had to see more 
So I walked down the hall and pushed open the door. 
And there he lay sleeping silent alone, 
Curled up on the floor in his one bedroom home. 
His face so gentle, his room in such disorder, 
Not how I pictured a United States soldier. 

Was this the hero of whom I'd just read? 
Curled up in his poncho, a floor for his bed? 
His head was clean shaven, his weathered face tan, 
I soon understood this was more than a man. 
For I realized the families that I saw that night 
Owed their lives to these men who were willing to fight. 
Soon 'round the world, the children would play, 
And grownups would celebrate on a bright Christmas day. 
They all enjoyed freedom each month of the year, 
Because of soldiers like this one lying here. 
I couldn't help wonder how many lay alone 
On a cold Christmas Eve in a land far from home. 
Just the very thought brought a tear to my eye, 
I dropped to my knees and started to cry. 
The soldier awakened and I heard a rough voice, 
""Santa don't cry, this life is my choice; 
I fight for freedom, I don't ask for more, 
my life is my God, my country, my Corps."" 

With that he rolled over and drifted off into sleep, 
I couldn't control it, I continued to weep. 
I watched him for hours, so silent and still, 
I noticed he shivered from the cold night's chill. 
So I took off my jacket, the one made of red, 
And I covered this Soldier from his toes to his head. 
And I put on his T-shirt of gray and black, 
With an eagle and an Army patch embroidered on back. 
And although it barely fit me, I began to swell with pride, 
And for a shining moment, I was United States Army deep
inside. 

I didn't want to leave him on that cold dark night, 
This guardian of honor so willing to fight. 
Then the soldier rolled over, whispered with a voice so
clean and pure, 
""Carry on Santa, it's Christmas Day, all is secure."" 

One look at my watch, and I knew he was right, 
Merry Christmas my friend, and to all a good night!"

So, anyway, disney movies. The best, of course, being Beauty and the Beast, but honestly, they're just so brilliant! How does one become so brilliant! It's truely awe-inspiring.

I was just thinking, last night, how soon my life is going to change...forever. Sure, when we came to high school there were a lot of changes, but for the most part, at least for me, life was the same. School, hockey, etc. In two years....it's all going to change. If I get into Rowan..no more hockey. Maybe...forever. It's just such a strange thing to think about. We look around nowdays and see people doing jobs they hate. Somebody's going to have to do those jobs in the  future. Who'se it going to be? I know, we all think, not me, no way, never. But all those people thought that once too. It's just so scary, realizing that your one life, your one future is now on the line. Is it just me? Do I have paranoa? Or do other people think of this? By the way, I can't spell paranoia. It's just so scary, because I wonder, what if I don't make it? What if I can't survive on my own? I've always had a little independance (which most of you know about) and I don't think I could deal with not making it. I think I could, I have a good plan and all that junk, but there's never a lack of 'what ifs'

Speaking of college, I choose you, Rowan University! That's right! That's my top choice right now! Affordable, close enough for my father to be happy but far enough where I never come home. MUHAHAHAHAHAHAA!!!!! It has exactally what I want academically, though no hockey. But we knew this...holy shit! My cell phone just went off SUPER LOUD!!!!!! Scary.

My god, my math teacher, Boccagna, she made me take the ONE problem I didn't understand (but that I did TRY for like 10 minutes last night and had the work to prove it) and go to the board when no one else was there, when everyone else was giving answers verbally. I started to cry! Luckily, I was facing the blackboard, so no one knew. I just stood there trembling, copied the problem, then had no idea what to do. I had to stand there like an ass. It was one of those moments that I have nightmares about. I can't belive it actually happened.

Anway, getting serious now. Niki's been asking me for a long time about guys, and for instance, why I'm not drooling over someone right now. Of course, I've got my eye candy, as does everyone else, but there are two things. First: People tell me I look manly! So there's a reason I'm single! And 2: I don't want to sound rude or conceided (even if I am) but there's just no guys that I know right now that have that...thing...that I want. You know, the love/hate relashionship, yet would actually care when I cried. Then again, girls like me don't get guys, so that's another reason I've kind of been blah. Not that I think I'm going to find a guy to marry in High School. That's another reason. I've got my whole life ahead of me. Not like I'm totally concentrated on finding Mr. Right at this point in time. Now if I were 40 and still single...then I'd start to worry.

Okay, enough drama! Party hardy!!! What's the best disney movie ever? (Besides Beauty and the Beast)?"

"event","Did you guys know that I'm really a princess? Let me explain. See, before I was born, dad and mom and Sarah Darlene (my sister) lived in a castel. That's right, a CASTLE! They even had a library. 280 acres of land. Horses and such. And then Dad got his trainers license (spelling again, Morgan) and so he was racing horses in...well in an undisclosed location. Mom was pregnant with yours truely. So she was running the Castle. It was called Avendale, by the way. And then, get this!, she was taking care of a horse one day, and it dropped dead, breaking her ankle! She couldn't take care of Avendale after that, so she went to live with my dad in the undisclosed location where I was born! So I'm living in Stormville as Megs instead of Castle Avendale as Princess Megs because some god damned horse dropped dead!

In other news, where's my fucking schedule!?

And in yet other news...I was going to say something but I can't remember what. Oh! Morgan! Call me about the you-know-what and about the you-know-when!!

Hey, listen, I'm going to assasinate hotmail. Anybody want to help? My dad needed an email account, so he set one up. Now his password, his user questions, all that, WON'T WORK! I've been mailing hotmail forever and no reply. What gives, mofo?

What else is new? I got a cat bite that got infected. Not nice. It was on my wrist. I had to wear a...gaw...thing I don't know. I wore something so it didn't move as much. Then I blocked blood vessles cause I tied it too tight. Hurrah me.

I think I'm the only one in the world that wants to go back to school. There's nothing to do up here! AGHHGHGH!!!! I really want my schedule. I want to see if I'm going to be all alone this year. I don't want to be alone....*sniffle*

Oh, last thing. Guys, I'm working on my family tree. Unfortunatly, all I have to go on are a few scraps of paper. So if anyone's got any good websites that will help me out and don't cost '$29.95 a month!' please let me know. Thanks, talk to you soon!"

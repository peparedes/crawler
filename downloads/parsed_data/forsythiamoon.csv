start off cold, with the blankets pulled over our heads. 
slowly heat up until finally the blankets are all on the floor.
gradually cool back down with bodies entwined and the blankets pulled back to our chins.
drift into sleep with your back pressed against my breasts.
your ass like a glove against my thighs.

warm lips on your cold shoulders.
cold fingers on your warm thighs. 

evenings spent snuggling on the porch with hot coffee and misty breath."

"event","Roxanne told me about Hellene.
I'm terrible about other people's grief, but i feel compelled to share something with you. I never got to know you and Hellene as well as i wanted to but you both have had a profound impact on me and my life.
those two weekends that i spent at future farm with you and everyone else involved in GCOW are some of the best I've ever had. i still tell everyone about them, about how GCOW was a spiritual resort for me. i always intended to return, every august, but circumstances didn't allow it.
maybe you never think about me, but i think about you and Hellene all the time. 
the ideas i have of my future self and my future life were forever altered by my experience of your lives. now, i always picture myself living a sort of permanent GCOW. where i welcome people into my home regardless of difference in political stance or life view. where i encourage people to love and respect the others around them. i want to live a life that inspires others to love and respect the earth and nature. I've always wanted that life, but being around the two of you, who live that life(if only for one weekend a year) made my ideas of the future tangible.
i have incorporated things i learned from you into my perspective. 
the things i learned from you two are simple, and i probably would have learned them eventually anyway, but i'm grateful that i learned them when i did.

your house is one of the coolest things I've ever seen. its made of scraps! recycled materials! an idea I've always had floating in fragments in the back of my mind. it is an inspiration. my favorite aspect is the greenhouse right off the kitchen. it was my favorite part of being at future farm.

the stories of the early days of your homestead always recharged my imagination.
living off the grid. a windmill that pumped your water. gravity toilets. composting. 

my interactions with you and Hellene helped me to tap into my own sense of duty. duty to the earth. duty to the people around me. 

movie night is rooted in my experiences at GCOW.
people talking and drinking and arguing and having fun together.
my interest in couchsurfing also has roots with GCOW.
i have an overwhelming drive to help people, to know people. this isn't something i learned from you or Hellene or anyone else, but GCOW was my first experience in living through this drive. and for that i am forever grateful to you and Hellene for opening your hearts and home to me.

i never really knew Hellene,but her death triggers a deep feeling of loss. a feeling of loss, but also a feeling of deep gratitude that i got to know what little i did of her."

i'm taking this science fiction class at school and it is fucking awesome. the professor is one of the best i've ever had. he's so good and so popular, that all but maybe five of us students are taking the class solely because he is teaching it. most of my classmates have never read science fiction and couldn't care less about it. i still don't know how i feel about it. on one hand, perhaps these non-readers will develop an appreciation for science fiction. on the other hand, a classful of passionate readers would probably be more interesting for me. i'd like to discuss the stories with others who have a strong background in the field, people who live for science fiction. oh well, the class is still my favorite."

"event","i've had my livejournal for almost five years. i've really neglected it lately. this is the fault of myspace.
a totally weird thing happened to me the other day :
i found a corpse at work.

for those of you who don't know,i work for downtown mobile alliance which is a non profit org. dedicated to the rennaisance of downtown mobile. my job entails: giving information to tourists and patrons,performing vehicle assists (such as changing tires, unlocking cars, jumping batteries, giving gas to those who run out...) and acting as an extra set of eyes and ears for the police. its sorta like a neighborhood watch for downtown. i do patrols on foot, bike,on the segway, in the truck, or in the kubota.

friday i was on bike patrol. i noticed a car with the windows fogged up. i thought maybe someone had fallen asleep or left a child in the car. i rode around to the passenger side, which wasn't foggy, and saw that the driver was slumped down toward the passenger seat.the man was grey. then i noticed that all the blood had collected at the bottom of his arm, which was extended toward the gear swift. i got off my bike and walked back around to the driver's side and looked at the man's face. his eyes were open. i called 911 then called my boss. when my boss got there he tried to open the car but the doors were locked. he then shook the car violently trying to wake the guy up. he swore he saw the man's eyes flutter but i could plainly see that the man was quite dead. we flagged down a passing police car.
 
i was initially shocked to find the body but after waiting around with the cops for two hours telling and retelling them how i found it, the shock had worn off.
when i first saw the guy i thought he was elderly but it turns out he was in his mid thirties.the police argued about the cause of death. to me it looked like a heart attack or stroke. most of the cops agreed but a few thought it might be poison."

"event","nana told me last night that she is considering giving me my mother's share of the family land.
then she told a relative (her niece i think) on the phone today that she is giving me the land.
i cannot believe it. five or ten acres depending on how she splits it!
she doesn't want my mother to have it because she knows mom will sell it immediately. nana wants the land to stay in the family. i want the land to stay in the family.i want to grow pine trees and keep bees. if i get a fielded part i will have goats. pine stands take about ten years to mature and cost about three hundred to plant. but, depending on the price of lumber one can sell an acre of pine for around 10,000 dollars. if i had five acres of pines thats fifty thousand dollars ever ten years or so. and bees! i've always wanted to be a beekeeper. bees are valuable now too. there is a shortage of hives and the bees are bought by almond farmers to pollenate the almond trees. and goats, well who wouldn't want goats? i could sell goats milk and maybe the occasional goat for meat. and eventually i'd like a pet cow. maybe two.
and not only is this land my family's ancestral home, it is beautiful! full of trees and streams and deer and smells!
the only drawback i can see is that it is in leaksville mississippi surrounded by my backwoods country family. some of them are really cool folk but some of them are quite scary. i may have to erect a large fence.
perhaps, i should feel bad for my mother. when the time comes for everyone to recieve their inheritance she may try to kill me.
but i know that she would never appreciate the land. to her it would be a cheap inheritance. she'd sell it right away. she has no interest in using it or spending time out there. and i wouldn't keep her away from it if she did want to camp or visit it. i just wouldn't trust her to own it."

"event","i cannot stand cockroaches.
nana is now mad at me.
she told me to look up tree roaches on the internet.
i did so.
here, in the south, a cockroach is considered a nasty thing that only
people with unsanitary houses have. a tree roach is an insect that lives in trees and comes inside 
looking for water and shelter. a tree roach isn't shameful because they are so common and they don't 
have anything to do with sanitation.
i looked up tree roaches and discovered that all roaches are cockroaches.
the nasty ones that dirty people have are the German Cockroach.
the tree roaches that everyone in the south has to deal with, are American cockroaches.
I was reading her the information i found and she said
""these are not cockroaches, they are tree roaches. There are no cockroaches in my house.""
i explained that they are all cockroaches and told her the difference between the german and american
ones. but it was no use she just got frustrated and angry. like i had offended her.

we didn't have many roaches untill a few days ago. they are all over now. the pantry has become
a place of terror. one cannot go in there without seeing one or hearing it crawl along the shelves.
they brazenly walk down the hallway now. yesterday i finnally conqered enough of my fear to kill them. 
i hunted down three and beat them to a pulp.
if you are unfamiliar with the american cockroach, allow me to inform you:
these roaches are 2-2.5 inches in length. they have wings and they fly.erratically.
i have no fear of any other creature like i do for the roach.
these things make me crazy.i have hurt myself to avoid them.
i even scream when i kill them. not a rageful battle cry. no a scream of absolute fear.
i still cannot remove their corpses.

on a lighter note, we stayed up till four this morning moving furniature, and our room is now in order."

i tell him that its okay 
scince theres no damage i won't call anyone

i dreampt alicia was pregnant.
and we lived in a huge southern mansion.
all wood it was a lovely shade of blue.we had a huge yard.
alicia went into labor and there were midwives that wouldn't let me stay in the room with her.
so i wandered outside and everyone i know was picnicing on the lawn and as i walked outside they all cheered and everyone was so happy. and i shouted
""i'm gonna be a daddy!""
everone kept comming up to me and congradulating me and i kept saying that i'm gonna be a daddy.
everyone was making such a big deal about this pregnancy.
i went back inside and alicia's parents were crying in this ugly parlor chair.i walked toward them to see what was wrong and it suddenly occured to me that alicia can't be having my baby.
i don't produce sperm.
untill this moment no one seemed to realize this.
i panicked and ran upstairs and burst into the room she was in and demanded to know who's baby it was.
she wouldn't answer me. 
i started screaming and breaking things in the room and she said 
""how could you not have known? you can't get me pregnant!"" 
i erupted out of the room,screaming and breaking anything in site and alicia's mom chased me trying to stop me. then i realized that alicia had never even had an ultrasound. 
i went back into the room she was in and she wasn't pregnant. 
the midwives were gone. 
i accused her of lying to me about the baby and she looked so sad.

i don't remember anything else about it.
after this dream i had another
in which i was desperate to get outta bed
but there were dead sharks on the floor 
and i kept cutting my feet on their teeth.

i had a really busy weekend.
very little sleep.
feel shitty today so i came home early from work.

lots of people came over saturday night and got drunk
i finnally learned how to open a beer bottle with my lighter
and everyone was impressed with my ability to light ciggarettes 
with my feet.

"event","Dental amalgams,known as silver fillings, are composed of roughly 50 percent mercury.Studies of people with mercury-containing dental fillings show a corelation between the number and size of the fillings and the amount of mercury excreated in their urine.The relationship suggests that the mercury is derived from mercury vapor released from the fillings. Some evidence shows that the level of mercury in the brain tissue of fetuses, newborns, and young children is also directly proportional to the number of surfaces of amalgam fillings the mother has.

we talked about the old man with cancer and his little dog that had cancer too
and how i sat on his porch and told lies all day with him

how i used to climb on the roof and hide from everyone
about the garden we had

"event","So I just talked to Missy. Shes not coming back. I am really bummed out. I am really going to miss her. I really dont know what to think. I understand why she did it and she had every right to do it. I believe she is a very strong person for being able to make a decision that she KNOWS will benefit her in more ways than one. Not many of us can do that. So she has props for that. Missy--I love you! I cant wait to see you this summer! I will definitely be out there this summer! Your an awesome friend and I dont ever want to lose touch!!!"

"event","Well I am back to working nights again. I am happy. Its keeping my mind off things and I know that I can do this. I have decided that I am not going to live my life in this box anymore and I am going to make myself get through this. But on the other hand I have Kyles bitch ass mom who showed up at Andrews house tonight with some guy trying to say that Andrew shot out the guys car windows. Andrews so stressed out. He said that he has never even seen this guy before. The guy said that he did it at 11:30 Thursday night...then why the hell are they just NOW bringing it up? Why werent they there three days ago to say something. Then they said that they have 4 witnesses...they are all pulling shit out of their asses and it took them four days to put a story together and match it...wonder if they remembered to put in exact times...prolly not the dumbasses. I am trying to convince Andrew to get a restraining order cuz ever since Mike moved out of Kyles they have been harrassing Andrew cuz they think that Mike is in Louisiana...so Mike if you ever read this...YOUR A DICK AND I HATE YOU, NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE EVER HAVE HAPPENED IF IT WERENT FOR YOU AND YOUR LYING WAYS...there that feels somewhat better. But anywayz...My sister got back from Mexico last night and she is all nice and tanned...I hate her. Its all good though. Grrr...I just cant get this shooting thing out of my mind. Its driving me crazy...I know nothing will happen cuz I no that he was at home and so does everyone else that lives there, but the fact remains that its still happening and I am tired of Lisa's (Kyles mom) bullshit drama. She just needs to leave everyone alone...GRRRRRRRR!"

"event","Well I have pretty much decided I am done with people. I have been in like this depression thingy and its not fun but shit happens. But I realize that I am letting people get to me and I shouldnt let them do that, cuz then they are winning. They win control over me. Not anymore. Today turned out to be a pretty shitty day. But whatever...it will get better tonight. I have a ""dinner date"" with Drew and that will be nice cuz we never see each other any more. I had my first dance performance and NOT ONE of my friends showed up. Its all good though. And then I have had plans with Heather for the past two months and she texted me after school and said that she would only be able to hang out and not stay the night, she didnt say for what reason, but whatever. My feelings were a lil hurt cuz we have had these plans for so long and I was pretty excited especially cuz I never really see her anymore. But whatev...like I said I am pretty much done. My friend Missy moves back to Cali next week. I am going to miss her so much. That just means that I have to post on here more often so that she can keep up to date...and she has to do the same thing! But anywho...my mom decided to get me help because my depression is getting better, its getting worse by the day. It sucks that this is happening. I dont no how else to say it other than I feel like a teenage mental case. There is no other way around it. Everybody keeps asking me what I am thinking or what I am feeling...and to tell you the truth...I honestly dont no. Then they get mad and frustrated cuz they want to help but cant not knowing whats going on inside my head. I think what also gets me is that for the first time in my life I cant control those thoughts or feelings. And even more so, everyones alwayz come to me for help...and now I need help, but who do I go to? How can someone else help me if they need help as well? I dont no if that makes sense or not...but it does to me...so it doesnt matter. I am almost on the verge of losing my credits cuz I have missed so much school, which stresses me out, and then I think I am probably going to lose my job for the same reason. I really need to get in and talk to my manager and get some of this stuff straightened out. My sister is in Mexico right now having the time of her life. I am so jealous. But whatever. I decided that I wasnt going to participate in anything to do with homecoming this year just cuz I dont feel like it. And btw none of this has anything to do with Drew. He has stood by my side and helped me when I have needed it most! Well my fingers hurt, but I promise there will be more to come!"

"event","Well I am over at my aunt's house getting ready to go to work. 

Sorry I havent updated in a while...my computer's been kinda broke and that kinda sucked. Oh well. 

So I have been doing alright I guess. I have been fighting with my parents ALOT lately. But then again, I guess who doesnt? I think that they have finally come to the realization though that Andrew and I might get married. It was scary not one time in eighteen months has my mom ever said anything about us getting married and then out of the blue she started talking about the song she was going to play at our wedding...wierd! So then like two days later my dad and I were talking and HE said something about our wedding...I was like WTF?! No one has EVER said anything about it and now its like the everyday talk. So it's cool I guess. I think that they might be trying to use reverse psycology. They have thought, in the past, that I only wanted to be with Drew cuz no one wanted us together, which isnt the case at all. I really do love him and anyone who knows us knows that...!

So yeah Drew and I are doing really well. We wont be seeing each other Monday thru Thursday because we both work and go to school. It might do us some good though. We will see what happens. I know nothing bad will come of it, so I am not worried about anything. I took him out to dinner for his birthday. We went to Panda Express which was totally gross. But oh well...

Well work is calling my name so I must go. I will try and update more often!"

"event","Last night went really well. Heather came over but not when she was supposed to cuz Rachel's mom took her car and she wasnt home on time for me to pick her up after work. My dads a realy jerk when he drinks though. A lot of mean and hurtful things were said. Some things I just wish he would stay out of and be happy for me. If I am happy that should be all that matters. Yeah I know hes a dad and hes going to be like that but its still irratating. Everyone left at about 11, but it was a lot of fun.

I hate Missy cuz they listed her as a Senior this year because she has enough credits...but she if she didnt have those other credits she would be a Junior. I am jk. I love her. She has worked hard for everything she has and she deserves alot. 

Work today was crazy. Everyone was like ""well fragrances will suck and its really boring, blah blah blah"". But I dont think that I had ANY time to myself. We were swamped because we were having a sidewalk sale. So it was pretty crazy. I learned a lot of new things. They had to put me on the floor by myself cuz they had lots of people call in today...its all good though. I just had my chance to shine. I am starting to get to know a lot of the people and everyone is pretty nice! So its all good. Well I am pooped so until next time...Peace!"

"event","Well heres the latest news....

I started work on Wednesday. Training online sucks because I have to read for like four hours. I did that Wednesday and Thursday. Today I trained for two hours on the internet and then I finally got to go out on the floor. That was a lot of fun. It beat sitting at the computer as I am now. Hopefully tomorrow I can train with Kayla or Amanda. But will see... I really like the girls that I am training with. We all have a lot in common and as usual I am the baby of them. Thats ok though... I met my new manager and so I am going to go talk to her tomorrow morning about my scheduling so that I know what I am doing for next week and when school starts. She seems really nice. 

Today I woke up and my house was flooded. My dad forgot that he was watering the grass last night and left it on...it was on for about 14 hours...:( and so the living room and backyard was all flooded out and it sucked. My dad wanted me to call in and we got into a huge fight about that. He wasnt happy that I wasnt willing to call in...Isnt it supposed to be the other way around? Isnt he supposed to fight to GO to work and not stay HOME?! So I went to work. My mom came home and then she started to clean it all up and then when my dad got home he called some people to come out and finish it. They had to tear up the carpet and get all of the water out. They said that they took out over 100 gallons of water. OUCH! So then I went and did some running around with Kay after work. Then I went to Andrews for dinner and fell asleep. OOPS...thats ok though. 

Well the latest with Melissa is that I hadnt talked to her. She called me on my cell on Wednesday and apologized and said that she knows what she did was inappropriate. But later I found out that the only reason she might have done that was so that she could go out with Andrew, Randy and I. So then this morning my mom couldnt get ahold of her cuz she needed the steam cleaner to start getting the water out...but it was at my grandmas. Well I am the only holder of Melissas room number so I called her and asked her to put outside and she asked when we could talk about what happened. I told her that I didnt know cuz I dont think that I am done being mad or upset yet. Just like at Christmas time when she didnt want to forgive me. So then right after my mom picked up the cleaner she called my phone and was like ""I want to come over and help you guys"", I explained that we had it under control. So then after work she called to ask if my electricity went out...I wasnt at home so I told her I didnt know. So THEN she called to ask me to go school shopping with her. Ok, what the heck?! I dont know if she knows that I am still upset. It just really hurt my feelings that she would do something like that...but I dont know...

Tomorrow night everyone is coming over and staying the night for a BBQ (Arlo & Tuesday with the kids and B.A. and Barb and Heather and Andrew!!) Yay! This should make for an exciting night!! Well this is WAY too long! Until next time...Peace!!"

"event","Well to start this off...Tim McGraw concert was totally awesome. I had a really good time with everyone that went. We have since decided to go to the Brooks and Dunn concert as well. I thought the Warren Bros. sucked but Big and Rich and Tim McGraw rocked! Faith Hill was there and they did a duet...Andrew didnt know what to do with himself...it was great. 

I start at Sears tomorrow. I went for orientation today and that was the longest most boring thing that I have ever done. It was pointless. I already knew everything...maybe it has something to do with all of my friends working there...I dont know call me crazy but I think that just may be it. But this is where the drama started...

I had Andrew take me to my orientation and Randy, Melissa and Amber went with him. Ok...no big deal. Well the orientation was only supposed to last 30 minutes (therefore I would have gotten out at 2:30), well Pauline kinda slacked off and so we didnt start off right away. Well we got started and she said that we would be done by 3:30 so I texted Randy to tell him. Well when I got done they werent there. So I went around the mall looking for them. I couldnt find them so I went to the food court and sat there and called them back to back for a half hour. Well no one answered and no one picked up the phone and no one texted me back. Well wouldnt that have aggravated you?! Well it did me!!! So when I finally got a hold of someone it was Randy and I blew up on him. Ok that was done and over with. Well then I went off on Andrew and THATS when Melissa decided to put her two-sense in and told me that I needed to shut up and stop whining because I whine about the stupidest things. So we had it out in the middle of the mall. I felt that she needed to keep her mouth shut because I was yelling at Andrew. The excuse was that she was trying to defend Randy, BUT if she wanted to defend him...why didnt she say anything WHEN I WAS YELLING AT RANDY? So now Melissa and I arent on speaking terms. I just think it was bull crap. Later I called and apologized to Randy and we are cool now. So I am not worried about it. My mom called Melissa and told her off. And what my mom said was true. If it was MELISSA on the other end she would have felt and done the same thing...she says no but everyone else knows different...SO yeah. I am ready to tell the rest of my family to just bite me because I dont want to deal with it anymore. I am tired of hurting...family shouldnt make you feel that way. But I dont know...I am only 16 apparently I dont know too much. But until next time...Peace"

"event","Well the BBQ at Tuesday's was totally awesome. We had a lot of fun. I love going over there and being with my family. The certain people that I was having a lot of problems with I blew off. I made sure I had fun and that's all that matters. Heather made my time extra fun. I love her so much! Like my mom said she is the bestest friend I could ever have! 

Tomorrow is the Tim McGraw concert! Yay! I can act stupid and crazy and I have an excuse!"

"event","Well I feel like crap again. Being a girl sucks. I slept most of the day away...cuz I can. Heather called and said that she wanted to come over for the weekend and so she's here now. Then Drew came over and we went to Wal-Mart. That was a lot of fun. He's so cute. 

I am kinda having a problem with myself I guess, but I really don't know what to call it. It seems a member of my family can pick and choose when they want to be a part of the family...they are married in, not biological. To me I don't think that's really fair. They don't want to particpate in family events because they hate the family but when it sounds fun then they want to join in. They have caused a lot of drama in the family in past and it just hurts. I really don't know how to explain it. I mean how would you feel being in my position? You have someone who has hurt your family so much and then they pick and choose when they want to participate. I don't think it's fair. Yeah, yeah I know life's not fair but to me it just seems wrong. I just needed to vent about that. My feelings are really hurt by the situation. A part of me wants my family to go back to the way it was before and I know that will never happen. I miss all the things that we used to do together as a family. We had a routine. Yeah shit happens though. 

These feelings came about because of the BBQ we are having tomorrow at Tuesday's. She wanted it to be Haillie's close net family and instead everyone and their brother is coming unexpectedly. Tuesday's feelings were hurt which is understandable. On top of that she doesn't even know these people and they are coming to her house and she is not too comfortable with that. She knows how everyone in the family feels about these certain people and it was something that we were supposed to do without feeling tense. Well I guess that won't happen.

Two more days unitl Tim McGraw! I can't wait. It will be my sister's first concert and I get to take her to it cuz she finally decided to go. So I am happy that I get to take her. Well until next time...Peace!"

"event","Well today started out to be BLAH...I slept all day cuz I feel like crap. But then I went to the mall with Andrew and Amber. On our way home Andrew and I got into a huge fight cuz he accidentally stepped on the gas in a water puddly and the car started spinning out control and we almost hit a van. I thought he was doing it to be stupid but that wasnt the case. So it all started from there. We had our blow out and everything got better. So we came home and watched a movie. He left when he got home he got on the internet and we had the best conversation ever. I love him so much I dont know what I would do without him. He finally REALLY opened up to me. It made me feel a lot better about our relationship and where it is going. So yeah...

Three more days until the Tim McGraw concert. I know there arent too many country fans out there but I love him! I havent missed a concert since '99. So its all good. Kayla, Heahter, Kasi, and Andrew are all going. It should be a lot of fun. 

We did this family swim thing last Sunday. It went ok I guess. I am not used to having my entire family over so it was kinda nerve-wrecking. 

I dont know if I said how my 4th of July trip went with Andrew and his family, but it went well. The hotel we stayed at sucked (The Hilton at Valencia) cuz the A/C didnt work. But it was great just being with Drew. It was better than our last fourth in which we were sitting behind Albertsons watching fireworks at GCC. 

On Saturday we are doing a family BBQ at Tuesdays. I am looking forward to that. I think it will be a lot of fun. 

Well Jade and I are having problems again I guess. I think that she thinks I am trying to take Heather away from her and thats not it. Its the fact that she has to babysit or she doesnt like who we are hanging out with and thats why we dont call her. The last thing I would do is try to take Heather from her and I hope she knows that. 

I have spent a lot of tonight talking to Missy. I love her so much. Shes the greatest... I hope that everything turns out for the best for her cuz she really deserves it. She has gone through a lot and she is a strong soldier and really does deserve alot. 

Oh yeah I almost forgot...I got a job at Sears at Metro as a cashier...I am waiting for my drug test to come back and then I will know when I start.

School starts August 9th. I am really bummed out. However it will be nice to see everyone again. I guess I better get started on those AP assignments!!! Well until next time...Peace"

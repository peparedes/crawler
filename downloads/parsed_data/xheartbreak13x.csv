"event","When the world turns away,
one never seems to stay.
So with her broken heart,
she turns and runs away.

The world screamed at her,
telling her the darkness in life,
never once could she fight back.
So she fled while the world ignored.

Now alone she cries herself to sleep,
wishing she could be saved,
but her knight is to far away,
so all she can do is hope and pray.

The world screamed at her, 
telling her the darkness in life,
never once could she fight back.
So she fled while the world ignored.

Years gone by,
nothing has changed.
The world shuns her,
her knight to far to grasp.

The world screamed at her,
telling her the darkness in life,
never once could she fight back.
So she fled while the world ignored.

Here she sleeps so peacefully,
the empty bottle still in her hand.
She thought she could kill the world,
but only ended up destroying herself.
No one seemed to notice,
the fact she wasn't there.
She still lies peacefully in  her bed,
as a testement the world gave.

The world screamed at her,
telling her the darkness in life,
never once could she fight back.
So she fled... and the world won."

"event","<p><font size=""1"">I don't even know why I try. I&nbsp;try to make my parents happy, I can do that with my&nbsp;Dad but my mom... it seems like she wants me to be perfect. I can't do it! I try to&nbsp;talk to her about how I feel (I get angry for the smallest reasons and I'm not sure why) and all she does is get upset and point out that I need to learn how to deal with these things and make them right...&nbsp;she doesn't help me, she reprimands me.&nbsp;And I feel like it's all my fault (it might as well be). And I&nbsp;am having a hard time with Algebra and the first thing&nbsp;she says is ""I don't want to work on it now because I don't want to get agrivated"" and there was so much other stuff. It makes me feel like I can't do a thing right ya know? I just can't wait till I move, I can get away from this. I mean, when I get hurt emotionally I feel like my heart hurts, ya know? It's a physical stabbing pain, and I just don't know what to do. I have a major self-esteem problem, random fits of anger, easy to annoy, and also easy to hurt and she knows it but all she can say it ""oh it's only in your head!"" maybe it is, but what if it isn't?</font></p><p><font size=""1"">I'll feel like I can do something right... one day... someday... it'll happen. I'll be optimistic about that.<br /><br /><br />.:Kallisto:.</font></p>"

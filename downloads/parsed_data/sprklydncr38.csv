"event","I'm getting aggravated with fricken gcc. I might have to stay there >:O...I'm not trying to say that it is a bad school to go to, but i hate it so much, i think maybe i just hate the campus that i am at. Who knows, but anyway...i might have to stay just because i won't know if i have a place to live at brockport until the middle-ish of december. What is the point of that. By that time i won't be able to get into half of the classes that i need because registration has already started. I think i might register in batavia and if anything actually happens with brockport i can always drop out of batavia. That works...right? I don't know i'm lost in a big mess, if only i were a smarter person. I wouldn't be stuck in this situation right now. Maybe it would've also eliminated some of the other stresses that i've gotten stuck with. Really...some of the other people(is what i really mean) Because of them i have to be honest and say that i cry either every night or every other...we'll leave it at that though. *Sometimes i just wish* PLEASE!!! Ok, now i'm begging and that's not a good thing to do. It will get me nowhere. Last night i almost got hit by another vehicle. I thought i was going to cry, not so much that it was scary either. I don't know what happened, it was an overwhelming rush of something coming over me. Time to really work on my work. Who would've thought that's what you're supposed to do at a job?

It's not my life...ok, so to get to my point, I AM ALL FOR IT!

They knew me, i didn't know them though. How they got my number...i don't know! How they knew my name or that i just turned 18...don't know that one either. When they called it came across as ""private caller"" on my caller i.d...so that didn't help. They sounded spanish or mexican. I don't know who they are so now i'm not answering the phone if it says ""private caller""(that means i won't be talking to rae on the phone anytime soon, unless i call her...lol) Off of the freak story now and onto the next...i went to the doctor's office today. I don't know what i have, but what i do know is that it isn't in just one area of my body. I'M A MESS! I'm taking a total of 1500 mg of amoxicillin a day and some other shit. Fran(the person i saw at the dr's) told me, ""now while you're on this medication, your birth control isn't going to work"" and she went on with some big story off of that...AT THIS POINT IN TIME, I DON'T CARE IF IT ISN'T WORKING!!! I told her that too...lol...i said it in different words, but it was pretty much the same...it made her stop explaining everything to me. Thank the lord. I swear she wasn't going to shut up about it.

Some older woman in my class said ""happy birthday"" to me, but i never said that it was my birthday to anyone in there...who knows how she knew it was my birthday...weird! I asked my grandpa to drop my little sister off at the school at 11. So, britt and i went to see my mom at the office. ""The other carol"" made me PINK cupcakes that had the little candy letters on them. ""KMC 18"" It was a cute idea and the weirdest thing is that she doesn't work on fridays, but she still brought them into the office for me. I love her! :-D Anyway, after we left the office, i took my sister to eat at ho-ho's china buffet and then to get a flurry. I had to bring her to work with me after that...(my grandpa was picking her up at the office where i work)...all that i have done since 1 is file some papers then i did some homework and now i'm on here. God i should just leave already.

""You are the one 
That keeps your dream alive 
And you are the one 
Who feels the rhythm deep inside 
Do you ever wonder 
If you can make it fly 
But you will never know 
If you don't really try 

There's so many fast breaks, 
Quick cuts and a million starts 
Can make you wonder 
Can make your dream 
Ahead of the star 
When you know your heart 
And follow your own destiny 

Don't get lost in the crowd 
Be the one to be strong 
And to live around 
Moving from dark to light 
You are the spark 
You have the fire 
You are the heart 
Now be a believer 

Look around you, you may not be 
The latest fashion or in a magazine 
I'm under high profiles 
But you will be 
A sweet inspiration 
If you've got your own style 

There's so many fast breaks, 
Quick cuts and a million starts 
Pulling you away 
From what you really love 
If you sing your own song 
Straight from your heart 
You'll find yourself rising above 

Don't get lost in the crowd 
Be the one to be strong 
And to live around 
Moving from dark to light 
You are the spark 
You have the fire 
You are the heart 
Now be a believer 

Cause we live in a world 
Of so many choices 
It's hard to find 
Our own voices 
And keep going on 
From day to day 
So give with the earth 
Give with the sky 
Give with the innocence 

Don't get lost in the crowd 
Be the one to be strong 
And to live around 
Moving from dark to light 
You are the spark 
You have the fire 
You are the heart 
Now be a believer"" -ab-

After an hour they pricked me again, but not enough blood was coming out so they pricked me in a different spot...they did this every hour until 11:15. God it was long and boring.

Has nothing to do with meaning it

Cause every time you're here
Your intentions are unclear
I spend every hour waiting for a phone call
That I know will never come
I used to think you were the one
Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all

You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that"" -MF-"

<P>Now that I got that outta the way...I gotta say that everything's going quite well. Not too bad, but not too well either. Break in 1 fucking week. Thank God. Because me and Erica are definitely planning on getting stoned together. YAY! Getting high with my Erica...how fucking awesome. </P>
<P>My dad's being gay. He told my mom that if I didn't ""clean my act up"" that he didn't want anything to do with me. Huh. Funny story, douche. Whatever. He can not want anything to do with me. What the hell am I gonna do about it? Kill myself? FUCK no. For all you suicidal fucking freaks out there who cut themselves because they think it's the cool thing to do and it's the ""only way to deal with the pain"" shut the hell up. I hope you one day cut too deep and end up bleeding to death on your bedroom floor. Cus that's what you deserve for doing that. Fuck you. Why are you so dumb??!! EVERYBODY has their issues and their problems and you think in your own conceited and arrogant way that your problems are worse than everybody else's therefore giving you reason to do the stupid shit you do. Well guess what? There are young girls out there getting raped by their fathers and stepfathers. Do you see them cutting themselves? No you fucking don't! And they have reason to. Taking a razor to your arms or your legs and watching yourself bleed over some guy is so gay!!! LOL!!! GOD! I hope you realize how much I despise ALL of you who do that. I might say I wanna kill myself when I'm pissed off or depressed-but would I ever fucking do it?? HELL NO. What a fucking cop-out. I have no pity for people who kill themselves. NONE. They did it themselves and they fucking deserve what they get. They made that choice to die because they felt it was their only way out when all they had to do was turn around and see everybody who stood beside them and just open up their fucking mouths and get help! It's that easy! How many fucking times have I or somebody I know done that? An innumerable amount of times. Stop being immature. Grow the fuck up and stop cutting yourself. You're fucking stupid, all of you...</P>

<P>So I think some people are slightly more straightforward than expected. Like Terry. Kim knows what I'm talking about. Oh yeah she does ""You like him don't you?"" *cocks head to side and stares in wonderment at his honesty* ""No. I just wanna have sex with him."" *now his turn to do the same* It was insane. Where the hell did that come from? Whatever-applause applause applause. I can't believe this is happening to me. One minute everything's fine and then the next I find myself sitting on the floor in the middle of a trashed bedroom fucking sobbing so much my head hurts. Friday I fucking flipped out. I just kept throwing shit off my dresser against the walls, exploding most everything that hit it. I knocked my bookcase over and then took my field hockey stick and put a hole in the wall behind it. That was when everything sorta became this black blur and when I came back to, I was sitting there crying, still wearing my coat and a lit cigarette in my hand even though I quit smoking. So I think it's safe to say that that could be qualified as slightly psycho. Strange, eh? Actually you're probably not gonna think twice about it because you don't give a shit. Well hey a girl can dream, right?</P>
<P>We might be moving again. Arizona maybe? That would be so fucking awesome. Yes, I think it's hell here too.

<P>I can't believe some people. Honestly. Where do they get the balls to do some of the things they do? Maybe we just ask too much of them.

Why bother with trying to help out somebody who doesn't wanna hear it yet comes to you everytime. And then they wanna turn it around to make it look like it's your fault. That's cool....whatever you know? I won't argue about it anymore because I think that we both have better things to waste our time doing. And by the way, I think it's even better when they say that you're never there for them...mmhmm. Interesting observation since I've been here for quite some fucking time. However when the situation you're arguing about hasn't changed in the past few months, it's like listening to a broken record, skipping and it never reaches the end of the song. Yeah and I know I'm being obvious about who I'm talking about and if she reads this, she's gonna know it's her. But I don't care. She already knows all this shit anyway so why should it matter if I shove it into the public eye? It shouldn't matter at all. And nobody knows what the fuck I'm talking about anyway. And it's not like this is some huge thing that I'm gonna go run and tell everybody about. But it just pisses me off that I'm her best friend and when I try to tell her that she shouldn't expect anything big to happen, she turns it around and says that when she needs me the most I'm too fucking little minded to listen. Hmm-you're not entirely wrong, yet you are at the same time. If it were something that I hadn't been hearing for the past month or so, it would of been a bigger deal. And she wasn't gonna tell me what happened anyway...yet they just expect sympathy because they feel like shit. Yeah I'm fucking like that too...but I at least tell people why I feel that way. I don't just expect them to know what happened and then get all pissed off when they don't tell me what I want to hear. I care, but I don't. Especially when it comes to him....</P>
<P>Other than that-nothing. Got stoned Friday night with some of the best fucking people in the world. It was so awesome and thanks to a certain somebody for letting us totally destroy your kitchen when the munchies hit us at about 9:30...it was well worth it my friend, well worth it. Ah, well I think that it's time for somebody to go slice her wrists and bleed into her bathtub...yes you guessed correctly, her is me. </P>

Why do I bother to get up every morning and return to this hellish place where <STRONG>everybody's</STRONG> the same, <STRONG>everything's </STRONG>the same and it's all the same bullshit that they shove down our throats and just expect us to take it all in like we're fucking wanting to be there anyway! Funny story assholes. I don't know, maybe I'm just too cynical and too much of a pessimistic bitch. But only half of me says that. The other half is <STRONG>screaming</STRONG> at me that I have a right to be this way....that I should do it more often. Because I realize day in and day out that all the&nbsp;douchebags at Olentangy are just lookin to get theirs. Fuck what anybody else might need or what anybody else might say because god forbid you actually fucking listen to somebody who might be brighter than you. Which, for Olentangy, I'd have to say that just about everybody at the school is brighter than the next person. So&nbsp; I guess technically it's an endless circle of nothing...? You ask why I feel this way. Mainly has to do with one person whom most people know of but don't know. I guess I just never really even considered the fact that this person could be <EM>just like everyone else</EM>. That he too could be an asshole and fuck people over left and right. Not saying that he has but I know he's capable of it. And it's odd that suddenly, what I feel means nothing to anybody outside of these 4 walls. I give up. I can't make everybody happy-especially those who matter the most. I don't want this godforsaken and totally worthless life anymore. Whoever said that it gets better, anyway? Because <STRONG>10 to 1</STRONG> says that that person never had any severe problems in their life...anyway-nobody's home and I do believe that the <EM>mota</EM> upstairs needs to be smoked...</P>

Well what if I didn't wanna fucking bear it? What if the only thing I wanted to do was freak out and slash my wrists? That wasn't an option for me ever though. Yeah, I might talk about it but do you honestly think I'd have the balls to do? Hell no. Everytime I think about it lately, I'll see that I do have a lot more here to live for than I believe. And times might not always be terrific and I might not always get my way but I got 2 more years and I'm outta here. But if I gotta be stuck in this shithole with all these assholes, then I'm gonna make what I can out of it. And Loopy knows exactly where I'm coming from here. Loopy-we've been through so much together. From my mom fucking go insane all the way to boys like Alex and Brennan (sorta eye opening encounters if you will) Nobody could replace you. Even if they did look like you and threw grapes at me beside a pool like you do...it just wouldn't be the same knowing that they wouldn't find it as funny as you would. Oh and we of course can't forget the times being high with Jose and begging him for chinese. That's the shit I wanna remember when we're living somewhere in Europe way away from my family, your family and all these dickheads here. I love you and nothing will ever change that. So here I am in Newark, Granville if you wanna get technical, listening to Pieces by Sum 41 and watching my 2 baby brothers Craig and Kyle make something out of what they're given in life...and they're gonna be here awhile so more power to them...</P>

Christ, what am I doin here? I feel like I keep running and I'm not getting anywhere. All I can hear is my blood pounding and see everything flying past me, but it all keeps comin back around. It's one big fuckin circle and they always bring me down. Where noone sees nothing, touchin faces in the dark, feelin pretty is so hard. I'm tired. It's all the same. I burned myself out a long time ago...tell me what to do....</P>

And you know very fuckin well who you are. God, I hope you fucking die. lol You are so incredibly pathetic! Do you actually think that you're friends like you for you? No, they probably don't. And your boyfriend? HA! The kid just wants to get laid! He's gonna hit it and quit it and then leave to go be with that girl he was with in Pittsburgh before he came all the fuckin here to live a life white trashiness...Wow. Wish I could be just like him. What a life I would be leading. Oh, most definitely. Well since obviously I have nothing positive to say about you, I'll be off now to go spend time with my wonderful people here. Farewell

I get to go out to Newark every fucking weekend to be with all of those wonderful people out there...woohoo.&nbsp;I can hardly wait!! But I guess it'll be better than sittin in a fuckin classroom all day, right? Or I could be wrong as I usually am. So my thoughts on her haven't changed much, of course.

So now of course, another's one probably pissed off at me. Yay. I love it. I don't fucking get it...I understand that I can be annoying and yeah, really annoying sometimes and I understand that I'm at least somewhat greedy if not a lot, but <FONT size=4>CHRIST!</FONT> The shit that happened today was fuckin retarded.

Or something like them...you know how it goes around here. Some things just never change. And when they do, it's not always for the better.

Christ, may God damn my soul and let me rot in hell for all of eternity. No. That's a bit much. So we just finished watching The Odyssey after reading the book. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that they said Odysseus was beautiful? Well fuck me running, but I don't consider a man that looks like my dead and rotting next door neighbor who was 200 pounds overweight ""beautiful."" But hey, this is just my view on things. So as of late, I've been having some issues, I suppose with my neighbor and if you're Kim I believe you know what I'm talking about. I don't really know whether or not to shoot myself or him. Or I could do a suicide/murder? Or I could stop talking about it because if you're like anybody at my school, you'll probably call the police and tell them that I'm planning on murdering my neighbor even though, in reality, I couldn't even hit him without feeling bad. I live on the main drag in my neighborhood and whenever I look out my window, where I can see all the happy, sunny, smiling, children, it makes me wanna scream and pull out all my hair. Sorry but I don't recall my childhood ever being all smiles and sunshine. Hell, I can't even recall 2 days ago being smiles and sunshine. It's a sad world we live in. </P>

The people, some of which, I'm seriously starting to hate with every ounce of feeling in my body. I just want this wrecked and beautiful life to begin. To put everything that I'v cried about behind me, to forget it all. To forget this place. To put those faces in the back of my brain and pretend that they're not there, even after they leer up at me out of the darnkness, causing me to lose my mind and go running back to the arms of safety again. I won't be lost. I won't be won. They will not fucking do this to me. Not here. And not again.</P>

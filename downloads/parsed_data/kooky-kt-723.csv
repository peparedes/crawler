the other group is soo retarded and childish. it's michelle and marla. michelle is now in foster care at age 16 and goes to cheek. central. marla goes to school with me. they're fighting over each other's relationships. they both think that they're in a bad relationship and take turns calling each other's bf and they'll randomly call and prank each other. they don't talk or go to school together...it's wrong and they need to just let it go. today while phil was i over, i was on the phone with one of them then the other right after....i called both of them retarded and told each one that they should forget about it and pretend that each of them fell off the face of the earth and should let it go! goddamn....i need new friends lol....

that's all that's new with me.....luv ya KT"

I was supposed to go to the mall at 3 but we had no ride and we're going at 6 now. It would be soo much easier if we were a little bit older and had cars.

"event","Ok then....it's been too long for me to go into detail about what's been going on, and most of you know what's been going on with me. I'll try to summarize things but it never works for me.

My group of closest friends has been dubbed as the Vicious 4. It's quite interesting. It consists of Jess, Kristen, Salina, and me.

04/29--Moonlight bowling. Jess&Tom, Kristen&Ryan, Me&Phil, & Josh all went together. We had fun as a group but if we weren't all there together we would've had a sucky time. 

05/03--Maryvale ""Talent"" show. There is not much talent. The bands Winnter Take All, Altai District(formally And Many More...), Ashes From Empires, and Septicemia were all good. I had an interesting time watching it and hanging out with Kristen&Ryan, Salina, Ashley, Jess&Tom(drummer of Winner Take all and was for Ashes from Empires), Phil, and everybody's friend Alain(that i don't know).

05/05--West Stock. Phil went. The bands were ok. I got to see my old friends and CIWWAF. There wasn't as many people as there was last year. I still had fun though. I went to Steph's after. 

05/06--I played football, soccer, frisbee, and boomerang with Courtney, Jess&Tom, Salina, Sandy, Amanda, Lauren, Katie, Kathy, Scott, and Jeff. That was fun. I initally was hanging out with Courtney. I was supposed to go to the movies or hang out with Kristen but she had to do the family thing.

05/09--I tanned with Kristen. We then went back to my house and watched my brothers and Hercules with Ryan and Phil. 

05/12--Painted my dining room after bringing the table, computer desk, and buffet(actually everything in the room) into the basement. I have a lot of bruises all over the place from it. Dean and I were the only ones moving things. 

05/13--Went to the movies with Phil and Kristen. We wanted to see Kingdom of Heaven but it's rated R. Dammit. We saw The Interpreter instead. It's a good movie. Kristen and I cried. Definately worth buying.

05/14--Steph came over. Phil came over after lunch. We painted my room, my sister's room, and eachother. We went out for chinese after.

05/15--Went shopping with my gramma. I hung out with Phil after I got home. He came over to my house instead of us going bowling with his family.(thank god) He didn't leave until 11. I didn't get to sleep until 2 becuz i had to move my room back to the way it was.

My room is now purple with green on the ceiling, and around the doors/windows and baseboards.

I have the house to myself this weekend. I'll be at Steph's on friday and most of saturday. People are more than welcome to come over on saturday night though. call me and I'll let you know where I live and if i want you to come."

It has been quite a LONG time since there was a post. During that time, I hung out with Ryanm Kristen, Phil, Salina and Jess, like usual. The 16th I had a candle/bday party. 

The 17th was a party for my mom's work....not fun.

The 18th I spent with Kristen and Jess....playing badminton on my side yard. Jess and I were left alone to talk at the ending of the day.....first time we've actually talked alone....we're getting to be closer friends.


Tues-Thurs was spent with Phil. Thursday night was spent at the school park with Kristen, Salina, and Phil waiting for Kristen's sister to get out of the Elem dance.

Friday was at Steph's house....I walked around in the rain with her and met up with Rob and we went to go eat. I forgot how fun it was to hang out with him. We rented movies, ate gummi worms and slept.

Saturday I woke up at 930 and was supposed to get a ride home from Steph's mom but she was sick so I had to call for a ride home. I got home around 1230. My aunt was there or here with my cousins so I chatted/played with them and then got ready. Kristen and Salina called to tell me the same thing and I had to call Phil. I left for Kristen's at 3. Phil, me, Scott, and her left for Salina's after. We hung out with Salina, Sandy and Amanda and were supposed to go to the show at the Icon but couldn't get a ride. We all went to the movies instead....quite interesting....our group split to see 2 diff movies. Me, Salina, Phil and Kristen stuck together and hung out at Wendy's and Mighty taco before and after the show...We all slept over....I didn't get to sleep until 430. 

I woke up at 9. I left at 11 with Kristen. I went home to change and eat then back to Kristen's to go shopping. I got a blizzard and pizza and wings out of it....It was fun. we both almost fell asleep on her couch. I came home and walked into a big messy family discussion where everyone was crying and I just wanted to sleep. but no i had to sit there and listen and talk. then we went out to eat. I wanted to sleep and still do but havent. too long of an entry. I'm done for now.

So tuesday I went to Marla's for ice cream....Wednesday I went out walking with Jess, Kristen, and Preppy. We went to DQ and then to talk at the school park......I got a call from Stoner too. I was happy. I was also the first person he's called back since his phone was shut off since November. I felt special.

The show on friday wasn't as bad as I thought it would've been. Full Proof was the first ones up and they weren't that bad. We didn't care for the others after that. Jess, Kristen, Ryan, Phil, me, Steph, and Shane mainly hung outside for most of the time. Steph was annoying and wanted to be inside most of the time so she could see Mike Reed play. We were sitting down and saw Tom from CIWWAF...we were then talking about how funny it would be if Shaant were there.....me and Jess went walking while Phil was on my phone and who did I see across the street!?!?! Shaant!! I walked over and got a hug and then we talked then my ""posse"" came over and he hugged everyone. We all went up to Wilson Farms. Phil beat me and Steph at pool twice just cuz Steph sucks and I wasn't paying attention....

Saturday I woke up and everyone was getting ready to leave. I walked into the kitchen and did the dishes for no aparent reason. Dean and the boys left to go hiking at his friends farm. I got money from my mom then watched Intolerable Cruelty then my sister finally woke up. I walked over to Phil's after showering and shit. We hung out there for a while then his dad asked if I wanted to go to dinner with them and I turned it down so they drove me home. I went to Kristen's after eating some rice. An hour later Phil got dropped off at Kristen's and we played with her hot tub, and me and Phil cuddled on the couch watching parts of Saw. Then Ryan and his mom came to pick us up to go to the mall/movies. We saw Fever Pitch. Kristen and I got teary eyed at the ending. Dean and the boys were staying the night so I was home alone.

Sunday I woke up to my sister yelling at my dog. I was home alone with her again. We had chocolate covered strawberries for breakfast with iced coffees made in my smoothie maker. I was home alone after that til 330. I went to Kristen's to sit on her front porch chatting with her mom and her mom's bf. The asian came over and then we left for Jess'. Louie was there and then we walked to get job apps at Ja-Fa-Fa hots. Preppy met up with us. We left there and went to Ryan's to chill. I went home around 830. Stoner called me during the day asking for directions to my house so he can randomly stop by someday. That pissed Steph off.

Today was the start of my aerobics class. It was fun. Me, Kristen, Jess, Biss, and Loef. I went home and talked to Fergie and then Steph and Phil showed up due to being locked out of the house. I went to Kristen's after dinner with jess and salina(asian). Then I came home to type this long thing since I'M A LOSER AND NO ONE IS GOING TO READ THIS!!!!!

kk I'm done. Peace!"

This week is going by slowly. Monday sucked ass I don't even remember what I did...Tuesday sucked, I went to annoying Marla's house and she wanted to go stalk Phil since he lives around the block from her and she shoved snow down my bra! That was cold! Monday I remember now, I went crazy again! I was sitting playing solitare and randomly calling my dog over and over in an annoying voice.

Today I was just ready to leave my friends lockers after school to go home and the fire bell started ringing. We all didn't know if we should go outside or not. Phil had his locker open and stuff on the floor, all the rest of us had everything. So we all had to walk outside and walk away from the school. Me and my friends just left and Phil was left there since he needed his stuff and had a track meet.

Tonight I went walking to DQ with Preppy(Zach), Jess and Kristen. We then sat at the school park and talked. Salina spazzed at me for us asking Zach if he liked her. 

I guess I'm going to be on Cross country now. Fun fun. New school, new experiences. Kinky huh? lol. And I'm taking an aerobic class with Kristen and Jess.

Friday will be my 3rd week in a row at Classic Roxx. Not on track, Stealing Fate, BBB, Believe in you, Arize, Another day faded and Full proof. Then the week after I will be back. Then on to the Icon the saturday after for a $2 show. SORRY SHAANT THAT I MISS OUT ON YOUR'S THIS TIME!!!!

I've mainly been hanging out with m y big group of friends, that I am slowly being accpeted to, and my boyfriend. We've gone to the mall, gone to a few shows, had movies nights, walked around and went to band practices.

I've even managed to get 2 people mad at me. 1 was resolved but I don't think things are going to go back to normal and the other doesn't matter because I'd never see this person other than at my friend's shows. 

I need to be older so I can drive or the law needs to be changed. My parents wouldn't be complaining and I wouldn't have to ask for rides to and from everywhere. 

I've had a fun time being off and don't really wanna go back to school. I have school work that needs to be done too. That'll probably be my sunday or my study halls now.

Sunday, mall with Kristen. We meet up with Salina and others. We went back to Kristen's, got chinese and talked. We started watching the Notebook but didn't finish. That the boyfriends will watch with us....muahhahahha.....

Spirit week 3/14-3/18....ended with a pep rally. Sat with Kristen, Ryan, Phil, and Nick. Kristen went to say something to me behind the guys backs and she was sitting 2 ppl away from me and she fell onto the bleacher when we were standing....it was funny! Walked home with Phil, he met my mom. Then we walked to Shane's during band practice. I was the only girl there........it was fun!

Saturday, nothing during the day. 2-5 the phone with Phil. 6-7 Kristen's house, with Teddy's bears and talking....7-11, mall with Kristen, Phil, and Ryan. I splet @ Kristens. Her dog didn't hump me this time! I have finally seen Rocky Horror, Holy Grail, and Dazed and Confused, thanks to her.....

Sunday woke up @ noon. Watched a movie, ate cereal, laughed at her mom. Walked my butt up the hill @ 3, cleaned with Niki. I went to Wal-mart at 6 for a new belt, screw that....no good ones. THen I came home for a stressful family discussion to clear up problems that are to be solved but never are.

Don't tell me now with a smile on your face
That you're lost...down and out
When there was nothing left in me

You can't stop fuckin' with my head
Stop fuckin' with my head
My silence you break
The smile that you fake (you fake)

[Chorus:]
There's not one thing that you can say to make it right
Unless you say ""I'm leavin""
And if you're not...then please tell me why
Please tell me why you can't

Save face
Say it to my face

Can I take all the filth in your head
All the words that you said (that you said)
And throw it away (throw it out)

You can't stop fuckin' with my head
Stop fuckin' with my head
My silence you break
The smile that you take away

[Chorus:]
There's not one thing that you can say to make it right
Unless you say ""I'm leavin""
And if you're not...then please tell me why
Please tell me why you can't

That shit you're talkin' don't mean nothing to me anymore
Limp dick...you fuck stick...let's settle the score
Run and hide you know I'll find you anywhere
Motherfucker...two faced prick with hell to pay
What's real is real...it's time to step up to the plate again
Swing batter-batter, swing batter-batter, swing...
What's real is real...it's time to step up to the plate again
Swing batter-batter...fucked me for the last time!

Just take a swing...
C'mon...you should've taken that swing...
Just take your swing...

"event","Well...I didn't go to school tuesday or wednesday. Friday I was in school for first period then I went home. I slept for four hours....obviously there is something wrong with me. 

Snuff came over and we went to Marla's house. We were there until 9ish. Her dad is soo awesome. He bought us dinner. We sat in the kitchen eating, playing cards, and talking. We walked across the street to Wilson Farms to get marshmellows and Rice Krispies...We made Rice Krispie treats. They were good.

Saturday I went to my Aunt's house in Batavia for a February birthday party, since there are 6 total in february for my family. That was ok I guess. I went home with my gramma and sister since they left later than my parents. We stopped at Wendy's on the way home. We went to Karaoke for half an hour in North Tonawanda but it sucked so I went back to my gramma's house and my sister's boyfriend picked her up.

Sunday I went shopping with my gramma. I must be sick....I didn't feel like shopping that much and I usually love it. My gramma kept asking me if I wanted things and I kept saying no. We stopped in to the Wendy's in the Falls to visit my friend who was her boss at Fantasy Island. I miss him soo much.

Some of my plans aren't going to go as planned this week. I did add in some though. Hopefully they'll remain....and I'll gain a new friend or possibly boyfriend......I'm still not sure of him yet.....we'll find out tuesday I guess.

Nothing is going on now....just listening to my 3 hour playlist on my puter....Peace!"

Valentine's day was interesting.....I got to carnations from Kristen and Jess. I was supposed to get one from Phil(one of the several guys that like me) but he was dating his ex at the time they were selling them.....My heart was stolen by my friend Greg 5th period. He wore it then at the end of class he's like here....take it back....heart's are gay. Loser! Shane took it after him. He put it in his locker....he shares his locker with his girlfriend who gets pissed off at me whenever I talk to him because he supposedly liked me in the beginning of the year. GREAT ISN'T IT? I think so....

Tuesday I had a doctor's appt. It was the ear nose and throat guy. He's a new one too. He went to Harvard...he makes a diagnosis fast. I have an infection of some sort that causes me to cough constantly. I'm on 2 antibiotics. I didn't go to school today because they make me sick and I wasn't use to them but now I am....He said if it doesn't clear up in 2 weeks he has to scope my voice box.....Hopefully there isn't anything wrong since I LOVE SINGING!!!!! It would suck completely. 

I have a lot of candy. I don't want to eat it though. 

OOOOO no school next week.....supposedly friday snuff is coming over....saturday I'm going to my aunt's in Perry(Bataviaish).....monday I'm shopping with Reba.....I have to hang out more with Snuff and I have to hang out with Jess since Kristen will be in Cancun for her bday.....and I'm going to see Constantine with Kristen, Jess and Salina the 26th and I""m babysitting later that night....30 Bucks more!

Saturday I walked home from Kristen's(down the street) to take a shower and get ready to leave again. Snuff and I went to the BLVD mall. I slept over her house.

Today I feel like shit and am on the brink of puking the whole lot of nothing in my stomach.

Tomorrow is Valentines....I know that I am getting 2 carnations from Kristen and Jess....i heard that I was getting a surprise too...from someone unknown and I haven't been told anything else and don't like surprises...I'm kinda iffy and have soo many things going around in my head.....

I don't know who from and the person that told me won't tell me anything either. The only thing I can think of it that it's from the guy that thinks I'm 'hott'(yeah w/e).

"event","Friday was my last midterm.....I came home and ate lunch, talked to Snuff, and took a hour nap. I was then picked up by Snuff and her mom. We walked up to the school to check if she passed or failed math again. We walked around the first floor and saw some people that were awaiting the talent show. I wish I could've stayed like I wanted to, but Snuff didn't want to. We got back to her house and ate dinner and watched '50 First Dates.'

Saturday Snuff went to get her Monroe pierced and I went with her. I almost threw up when they were trying to put the ball on. I can't stand the sight of someone else's blood, but if it were me, I'd be fine. Then we went to my gramma's house for a candle party my sister had. That's basically it for sat.

Today I was supposed to go to a local band concert at IOP(Infant Of Prague) Church. Why at a church I don't know. On our way over(me and my friend Kristen) we got a call that the show was cancelled. We were already halfway there, so we went to our friend Jess' house. We sat in her kitchen and talked. We then decided to go see 'White Noise.' I have yet to find a scary movie.....I thought this was a little stupid but I did say the same thing for 'The Grudge,' when everyone else was creeped out.

I'm sleeping in tomorrow since I don't have school! I'll probably wind up going to hang out with Kristen. I'm done.....Peace!"

I thought that my livejournal needed a facelift...I don't know how long it's going to last. 

This school really sucks. Most of the people here don't, but the school does. I don't know how many times I have said this and I'll probably say it a lot more.

Midterms start in 2 weeks. Unlike every other sophomore at West, I have exams Tues-Fri that week. Math A tues afternoon. English wed afternoon. Global thurs morning. And last but not least, Bio fri morning. Yay! *sarcastic*

I got to get out of Bio today to sit through another person taking about her HIV infection that just recently turned to AIDS. I sat there eating gummi worms my friend bought me for coloring her map. I LOVE GUMMI WORMS!!!! They're fat free and really good! The first one I ate though, I choked on. It hurt.

I may have to skip school one of these Fridays to go to Batavia and watch my cousins. She wants to have her baby really bad and is thinking about getting induced. She called me, out of everybody to watch her kids. She said I'm the only trustworthy one! I feel special! For now.

Everybody makes a big deal about the people that you like here. It's quite annoying. My friend Kristen thinks that every guy I say I like, are going to hook up with me. That hasn't happened. If only it did. 

I need money! I might be going to a friends show at Classic Roxx this weekend and that's 7 bucks then Shaant's show is the following week and I PROMISED that I would support him. I mean it's the first show and he's amazing so why wouldn't I go? That's 10 bucks at X-treme Wheels. The only thing now is convincing my step-dad that I am a big girl AGAIN! He got mad at me when I went to Showplace and told him it was my second time there. Like he hasn't done stupid things growing up! I've heard stories. He grew up in Kenmore and moved to Buffalo after and he thinks that I can't take care of myself! IDIOT!!

Well yeah I'm done ranting......Peace!

Oh yeah, I know some people in Kenmore wanted to Kidnap me for a weekend....call me and let me know when so I can get a ride over and ditch Snuff. She's the only one that has been making plans with me. All except that one glorious time with Reba(that was said without queerness)."

I haven't been home that often either. Friday I was at My gramma's. I stayed there until monday. Monday was the only night I was home. I went to Snuff's house Tuesday afternoon and didn't get home until Thursday(today). That is way too much time to spend with her. I feel bad for any boyfriend she may get. But she's my friend and I love her anyways. 

We rented Ghost Watchers and Napoleon Dynamite. Ghost watchers was more gross than it was scary. I guess I can't find a movie to scare me. Napoleon Dynamite was amazing! We watched it twice and laughed so hard we cried! It was ""flippin sweet gosh.""

I went to the Blvd. mall with Snuff on wednesday. I spent all my money except I have some of the store credit left at TTNY. I bought bracelets from there and having 5 people work on the store credit was kinda funny. I apologized for being difficult. Then they sent out the manager. OOO man!!!!! He was HOTT!!!!! Snuff and I both looked at eachother and turned red and flushed. I had to take my hoodie off after that.

My uncle dyed my hair today. I like it. It's finally darker and has some auburnish highlights. My hair is naturally dark(close to black) but I haven't seen it since the 6th grade. After this grows out I might be done dying it so I can actually know what my natural is.

I have a dog now too. It's an old english bull dog. We got her from a friend of the family because the owner wasn't taking care of it. She's my bitch. Her name is Chatanuga Chili dog, Chili for short. She's cute. And she's not a big dog either which is good. I dog really like dogs but I can deal with the little ones.

I guess I don't want to come back to West after all.

Anyways, Christmas was ok. It didn't feel like Christmas. My family actually got along for the most part. My sister is the only downside. Since she's pregnant now, she's been a bitch and thinks she needs to be the center of attention. My cousin asked if I ever got sick of it, truthfully I do and I am. That's probably why my sister and I haven't talked in about a week or so. I live with her and don't talk to her, that's pathetic. He knows how people act when they're pregnant, his wife is on thier 2nd her 3rd. He can't believe everything. She was gone with her boyfriend for most of the day so I only put up with her for 5 hours or so.

I got an electric guitar, a purple Dean, along with a huge ass amp. I also got a pen-sized digital camera. Those were the only 2 things that I was excited about. I do like everything I got but yeah.

I was told that I have to come back to West but I can't. I want to but I can't. This school is too fucking small. Everyone knows everyone here. I miss everyone there on top of it all. I'd probably miss the people I met here if I did go back. I miss everyone there more, at this moment in time.

I was making cookies and sponge candy tonight. I'll be in Kenmore sometime next week. Call me if you wanna do something and want to pry me away from having to do nothing with Snuff. 

I want to see Napolean Dynamite. Sad that I haven't seen it, I know. I don't see new movies very much. I want to see The Darkness too. Oh well. I probably won't be able to until it comes out on movie. 

I hung out with a few friends tonight as well. I talked to Kris about some pretty interesting things. They're all destined, here, to get me a boyfriend. The guys that like me are either creeps or have a girlfriend already and their girlfriends wind up bein my friends already. I guess that would make them creeps too.

This weekend was iffy for me. Snuff came over on Fri and we had our little christmas gift exchange thingy. We just played cards and talked most of the night. 

I went home with her on sat. We actually went to get stuff to make cookie bars. We went to BLockbuster too to get movies. We got Ju-on(the Grudge) and her brother got Dodgeball. Then her mommy ordered pizza from TC's. I haven't had their pizza in soooo long. We then sat down to watch Ju-on. I thought the Grudge was funny. I didn't find any of it scary. Watching Ju-on, I laughed hysterically! It seems as if it's a litte bit longer. It is more confusing than the Grudge. Now that I think of it, they're both confusing.

I got picked up from her house around 1 on sun. I went christmas shopping with my parents. I spent 20 bucks after I was given 33. Altogether I had 45. All my christmas shopping is done now. I just need to find butter extract so I can make buttercream icing for my gingerbread cookies I'm going to attempt to make. I also might make buttermints or lemon cookies. I LOVE COOKING/BAKING!!!!!!!!! I have to find time to make sponge candy (by request) for my one friend then I have to find my way back to kenmore sometime. But he drives and has a car and I don't see why he can't come over here and pick me or the candy up! Stupid men! Gotta love 'em though.

The pics are mostly of Shaant. There are some of Fillmore but they kinda suck cuz I didn't figure out how to use my camera til after they were done. Oh well. I walked out with 2 hugs from Shaant and some of his sweat in my ear.....mmmmmmmmm.....yummy!

I'll probably go to some Cherry-bing shows to continue supporting Jeff but other than that, the other guys are just mean and nasty. Shaant is a really nice person and didn't need all that shit. He's probably just too good for them and should do fine with CIWWAF. I know I'll stick behind him and help him out. I know a few others who would too. You guys rock!

I'm going to go now.....Peace!"

Hey, see me over here?
I got something to say 
I know I may bother you
But you're all that's on my mind
I can't get rid of you
You're all that I can find
When I'm walking through the halls
Or staring at the walls

Leave me alone
Leave me alone

Hey, can you hear me?
I'm talking to you
I know you don't like me
But you're all I see
I want to know one thing
If you and I can be
But all you're thinking 
That I can tell is

Leave me alone
Leave me alone

Alright, I get the point
You're ignoring me
You don't want me here
You run and hide
Whenever I am near
All that's left to do
Is break my crush on you
So I can

Leave you alone
Leave you alone

It's near the end
You're not even a friend
It's time for a heart to mend 
After all of that
I feel like an unwanted toy
Just awaiting the day
I am wanted by another boy
But for now it's dark I fear
And all I am is alone

I'm left here all alone
All alone

Yeah so what do you all think? I know the ending sounds a little depressing but hey it works! I wrote it 2 days ago after I peed. It was a random spurr of the moment thing. 

So the last show with Shaant singing is on Friday. I'm going, who else is? Well, I'm going to get going now......Peace!

"event","December is here! I'm not too happy.

Wednesday I went to Snuff's house. I went to West on thursday and friday. Thursday I went to meet the person she likes and see as many people as I could. I miss the large, overcrowded hallways. Mine area smaller and I have to deal with the little people from Middle and elementary schools. Snuff came home with me after my dentist appointment. I have good teeth surprisingly enough. And I'm a ""good brusher.""

Reba came over later. We had a bitchin' good time. We played board games, listened to her cds, and talked. When we had our sleeping arrangements made up we just talked. Snuff fell asleep around midnight and Reba and I talked until we fell asleep at 330am. That was a pretty intense conversation about really random things. I miss her so much and love her so much. WE MOST DEFINATELY NEED TO HANG OUT MORE!!!! That can go to other people too if they really miss me that much. I do want to stay in contact with my 'West' friends. 

I went to the Blvd. mall today(I haven't been there in soo long). I went with Snuff, her mom, and her bro to get them glasses. I guess I saw Josh Newman there, but was kinda out of it, and walked right past him. I already talked to him though. He laughed, so yeah. Then I had to babysit my 3 devilish cousins. That was a living nightmare. The eldest of the 3(9 yrs old) pinned me against the wall, out of anger,(and yes he weighs a lot more than the 130 of me) so i slapped him. He cried. I got pissed off even more and started crying(which I do when I am angry). He called his mother because he's a momma's boy. I got 37 bucks from that.

I'm at my gramma's right now because we're going shopping tomorrow. I think we're going to Canada to shop Niagara on the Lake like we use to every year but have stopped. So yeah......fudge and cappacino here I come!

I'm tired and have a major headache, which I should be use to but yeah......I'm going.......Peace!"

"event","Yeah this was an interesting week. 

Wednesday night Snuff came over around 7 and met me at Kristen's house. That was an interesting time. Then around 8:30 we walked back up the sreet to my house. 

We drove her home thursday morning. Then I went to my aunt Bev's for lunch (which was a thanksgiving dinner) and then to my aunt chris' for dinner. I went to my gramma's that night. 

Friday, I was supposed to go shopping with her at 4:30 in the am but I didn't feel good so I slept until 3. She had to work so I decorated her house while she was gone. My grandpa and I had to pick up my gramma from work and we picked up Snuff on the way back. We both stayed at my gramma's. 

Saturday my grandpa drove my gramma to work and me and Snuff back to my house. We walked up to Rite Aid, CVS and McDonalds. Then back to my house for the house warming thingy. It was boring. My friend Chris never showed up. I actually didn't expect him to but my friend Phil did and I wasn't here but he's actually both mine and my sister's friend. I had to babysit my cousins in Pendleton. I made 30 bucks but split it with Snuff. My uncle then drove us back to my gramma's because it was closest. We went online and I read people's lj's and Gabbi had posted about me. I couldn't comment back because she blocked me so I wrote her a note that she will get tomorrow in school and I can't wait for the response. Time for me to throw back all the shit that she had thrown at people throught the time that I've known her. Snuff told the guy she likes that she liked him and then Maue called to talk to her while I fell asleep and she yelled at me for that. 

Today my gramma drove me and Snuff back to my house where Snuff got picked up. My gramma took me, my mom, and my sister out shopping. I got 2 Sesame Street shirts. Then I came home and played video games with my sister in my freezing cold basement. Now I'm here.

Yay! Another 3 day week of school for me! I have to babysit friday and can't shadow at West because Mr. Greco is a loser. I want Mr. Murphy back but I don't even go there so it doesn't really matter. I'll have to find a time to have my house party here that I wanted. I'll probably have to get someone with a van too so I can pick up the ppl that can't get rides out here. 

That stuff was all boring and pointless...I promise for a more exciting entry nest time.......Peace!"

Yeah, this is a little pathetic. I am home on a Saturday night updating my LJ. Yeah, I did make friends, but I don't hang out with them often. Hmmmm.....it's sounds like how everything was when I lived in Kenmore. It must be me then. I truely am a boring and annoying person that people forget easily.

Well.....this Thursday and Friday no school! Then Saturday there is a ""house warming"" party here. I'm hoping that my friend (and my grandma's old boss but he's only 18) comes. I miss him soo much! He said he wants to get ""reconnected"" but everytime I try to call him he's working or he's at school. Damn freshmen! (yeah, college freshmen there, for those who are a little slow) *hehe*

I found out that I do not have strep! I only have a virus and this virus cause blisters on the back of my throat. EWWWWWWWWWW much?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! That's just a little grody....wouldn't you say?!?!?! It hurts like hell though. 

READ THIS AND TRY TO HELP!!!!! Alright.....this is a question from a friend who is too chicken to ask people.....maybe you guys can help her out........ she likes a guy who is in one of her classes but isn't sure if he likes her. There is major flirtage going on but you can never tell with guys because they like confusing girls but don't like when we do it to them......yeah......she wants to know if she should personally tell him that she likes him or if she should have some people tell him that she likes him. What would you say or do?


Yeah, I'm done and out! Peace!"

"event","Today my friend Shane and Greg decided to throw my phone across the classroom. Fun isn't it?!? I was freaking out! yeah that's about the most exciting thing that happened today.

So.....3 days of babysitting down....I might actually not have to babysit them tomorrow of fri. My sister came home just as my step-dad was leaving. She said that she was looking for apartments for cheap. I told her to look up Kendev studios because they're having an open house thingy. I looked it up for her tonight and it's not that bad. Rent includes a lot of nifty neato things. And it's near West. She said if she gets an apartment there I could move in with her and help her with the baby and go to west my junior year. 

That would rock! But it would kinda suck at the same time.....I have made friends here and some are pretty cool. What's funny is that people here think I'm cool! That I found interesting. I think that I'm boring, annoying, and ugly. But I kept telling people this and they told me that I am none of those things. But I am a little wierd. I knew that....I don't know why people keep telling me this. It's kinda sad when you're new friend's boyfriend has a crush on you. Supposedly he ran through her friends before she got here in January last year. I was told that he'd ask me if they broke up but I can't see that happening. They're too cute!

I downloaded some songs from some of my friends bands. One is Armed Response (was once Terrors of Today) here in Cheektowaga at Clevehill High. And the other is Decento 2 Demorior(random people from random places but I know the guitarist Greg and have a crush on him and I have 5th per. with him)

I was told I need to learn bass and electric guitar. I was told it's easy. I personally have always wanted to play drums and was invited to the hott 23 yr old's(that my step-dad works with) apartment to play. That'd be awesome! yeah.

I think I'm done typing for now....peace out!

Oh yeah, the song has been stuck in my head all day! And I havent' heard it for a few weeks now."

"event","Damn........I hate being sick! It started on sunday with just a sore throat. That continued on monday. Today it was bad. I had a fever at 4am and stayed home from school. On top of that, I got a migrane at 1:30pm that I lost some of my sight with. I fell asleep after that. I woke up in time for General Hospital and my sight was back. My friend Marla calle and I ignored it. Then I talked to Snuff. 

I still had to watch one of my brothers instead of both of them. It wasn't that bad since he was sick too and didn't move. All I had to do was keep Nickelodean on.

Well....I'm feeling kinda shitty again and don't want to type anymore on this.....Peace Out!"

"event","Yeah well, friday I woke up at 7 am to go to school. After school I came home to pack. My aunt Nett came over with our groceries. I GOT LUCKY CHARMS!!!!!!!! *hehe* ;> yeah and then I went to Snuff's, ate dinner, and left there at 6:30pm. We went to her friend's church for a night outing. We left the church at 8pm to go to Klienhan's for a little ceremony thingy. We left there to get on the buses around midnight. We then drove 2 and a half hours to Erie, Pennsylvania for Splash Lagoon. I was going to call Sam and Kristen but didn't know if they were awake or not so I called Stoner and Chris but they didn't answer. So I talked to Shannon and Snuff. We got to Splash Lagoon at 3 am. We left at 6 am. Our ride home I slept 10 mins total. I watched the sun rise and the clouds change colors. 

We got back at the church around 8 am. I went back to Snuff's and we played cards then ate. At noon she fell asleep. I started watching t.v. then doozed off for a few mins. I probably got an hour sleep total. Came home, got yelled at, then got ready to go to the show. I went to Rite aid first to pass some time and get batteries for my digital camera. Damn things are expenses. Sam met us up there and she paid half of the batteries. THANX SAM I LOVE YOU!!!!!!! We came home early and ordered chinese since we didn't eat since 10am. We went on the net, went to Hollywood video and rented Ginger Snaps 2 Unleashed. We now have seen all three Ginger Snaps' movies. They're good. I recommend seeing them. They're Canadian films.
 
Snuff left around 11 and I did nothing all day. I never do anything.

I have to babysit my brothers everyday this week! It's going to suck! I hate tax season.....that's when my mom starts working again. And she works a lot. Worse part, I don't get paid for watching them. I watched them for the whole summer once nad never got paid. God damn! CALL ME TO KEEP ME SANE!!!!!!

And that's all folks!"

Well, things here are fucked up like I thought they would be. My mom is under a lot of stress because the house is not ready for winter and needs to be fixed up. The school system here sucks too and I knew that since the first day of registration. The school is putting my brother through $4,000 worth of physical therapy because he cannot use the right and left side of the brain at the same time. And on top of all this, my sister foudn out she was pregnant 2 days before her 20th b-day (Halloween). She still lives here at home and has no idea of what she's going to do career wise and she's a junior in college. She has sooo many loans to pay back and doesn't have a steady job or good grades either. She's not too bright. And people always forget about me or don't pay attention to me but I'm the smart one even though I'm the younger one. My mom just realized that I'd make it in the ""real world"" better than my sister would/has.

Friday I'm going to Splash Lagoon in Pennsylvana for the 2nd time. I didn't enjoy it the first time but I'll be there with some friends and a church group. Ha! Me and a church group! Oh well.....I'm going to Classic Roxx this saturday. Going for Armed Response, joined with Ashes from Empires, Tears of Tomorrow, Another Day Faded, A Loss for Words, and BBB. Starts aroudn 7 and it's $6 at the door.

I have to be a child psychologist tomorrow 8th period on tape! Gotta love the english skits! No school on thursday!!!! Wait.....why am I cheering? I have to babysit my little brothers. Dammit! They drive me nuts! I have a feeling that the t.v. and candy are going to play a big role in that day.

I'm gone! Byez...miss you all very much! ;> muah!!!!!!"

Anyways, short post.

I hung out with Kristen tongiht. Fun stuff. We found Shane. No one knows who these ppl are so yeah.

What d you say to a friend that thinks they lost all their friends? Besides that you're there for them? I asked and got the same thing back, but thanks again if you're reading this, to whom tried to help.

I started getting back in contact with my sister's friends that she has abandoned since her college days and boyfriend. It's funny how her friends like me more than her. I got yelled at for all them liking me for that too. How I am going to help who likes me and who doesn't? That would be awesome if I could. Oh well.

I get to go to a new student lunch tomorrow and skip global to go for periods 6 a and b. yay! We're just watching ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" anyways. Seen it in 8th grade social studies. ""Ah the power of cheese,"" is all I have to say.

I got 2 new hoodies too! From the boys section at Wal-mart. They're hott and warm! My little brothers can wear them too! It's funny how I wear their clothes! I love it!

"event","I'm slightly Hung Over and extremely tired i couldnt sleep what so ever last night and when i finally did manage to fall asleep my damn alarm woke me up for fucking work...so i had time to spare and decided to come on and give a brief update on what i can remember from last night/yesterday...i had shit loads to drink and was quite drunk, i came home went on the net and started talking to the guy i like who left today (very painful to think about) i think i really pissed him off last night but then we spoke on the phone and all i could do was cry i never got a chance to really tell him that i was really glad i met him, he actually made me feel cared about, and to thank him for the nice times we had together...i'm missing him so much his flight was at 8am so hes prolly on the plane right now...wonder what hes thinking...he said he'd try email me to tell me how is flight was and if he got back ok and he asked me to email him so i'll do that on my lunch break but as of now i better get off to work..."

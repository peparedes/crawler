so why is this song going through my head? i don't even know to tell you the truth...I mean I should be so happy and then again I am not. I mean I am overjoyed with Hugh...he is all I have ever needed and wanted...I am just wondering if I am that lonley and if I am no one is really noticing. I either have a good mask or everyone around me is so busy that they can't see it.  Is that what I do all the time keep that mask on so no one will see it and does everyone that feels that lonley do that so know one WILL know.  I don't know...all I know is from four to seven thirty every weekday I am so happy and then I feel so lonley.

"event","well what a weekend and somewhat of a week it has been for me and my family. So friday I go down to Macon to see Jazmine for the weekend and it was so wonderful to spend time with Jaz and be with friends. So on Saturday Hugh and I were planning on just having a day to our selves, but lo and behold I learn that my grandfather is the hospital. So here I am a hour and half away and I feel so useless.  I have never been away from him when he was in the hospital. So Hugh and I went down to be with my grandparents and I am so glad that Hugh was there b/c with his knowledge he helped my poppa out so much. We stayed with my grandmother Saturday and Sunday we were back in the hospital to be with him b4 we left. On sunday he was so good I mean he was looking better, so I just knew that he would be out sometime this week...it was just his gaulbladder.
Then it came tonight...the news. When they did some test on him they found out that it wasn't his gaulbladder it is a tumor on his stomache. So yeah I freaked out and I am still somewhat upset. They will have to transport him to ATL or Augusta for his surgery and we wont know until Thursday if it is cancer or not...so just the waiting will kill me. I am just worried and upset b/c I am not in the same room as him and I can't do anything about what is going on. This man is more than a granfather to me he is so much to me that I don't know what to do if he were gone.
I am know just sitting here all by myself(Hugh is at work) and I don't know what to do or how to deal with this...I feel so helpless...worthless in this situation and I just want to be closer to him in distance...please everyone keep me and my family in your thoughts and prayers...Love to all...I don't really feel like talking or typing right now...bye"

"event","I have had the busiest three or four weeks of my life. Let's see Hugh's dad was in the hospital for two weeks and a few days after he got Hugh's mom went into the hospital so my time has been spent with taking care of them and things like that. And just last week Hugh and I had to take 11 young people to Tennesee for a youth camp, which I have to say was relaxing to an extent. The night before we left I got really sick. But it must have been a 24 hour thing b/c the next day I was weak but ok. 
But anyways where we stayed was so beautiful and quiet. To get to the camp you have to go through Amish country. It was amazing b/c you just can't believe that people can actually live with out electricity and running water. Hugh made the comment that he would like to live like that for thirty days. I don't know if I could do that, I mean I have lived for so long with it. It would be different if I had been raised my whole life like that but I just don't know. But one day Hugh, me and some of our close friends went and visited some of the amish houses. Which I have to say was fun. It was the ride home that was torture. An eight hour trip turned out to be a 12 hour trip and I was not in the best of moods. I gets nerve racking when you are in a van with eleven children and they won't shut up. 
But all in all I have just been real busy. I am trying to get all my ducks in a row,which can be difficult at times...but I have to go"

I went to the library and returned some books, and I checked out another one which I am excited about b/c it seems like it will be real good. I then went to wal-mart to pick me some drinks up and just look around...something to get out of the house for a time. I then went to the SS office to change my name...yes I JUST now did that, but hey I have been kind of busy. I then went to the bank and changed my name there too. So all I need to do know is get my Licsence changed...which I am waiting on. For more reasons than one: I turn 21 in November so why change them now, I just renewed them, and I don't know if I will need a GA one for long.  After I did all that I came home and cleaned the bathroom and the den.  I worked my butt off!
Then it all came crashing down...I don't really want to talk about it now...but I do need someone to talk to...JAZ, NAI, HARE....I need one of you right now. I can't talk to anyone else about it b/c it seems that they won't understand...I know you guys will.

"event","Last Friday Hugh and I and eight teens from our old church went to Virginia to work at a Junior camp and attend a Senior camp. The junior camp had seventy children from the ages of 5-10. One little boy stole my heart...His name is TJ and he has CP, and he is nine but on the mentality level of a four year old. But none of that stopped him for the four days he was there. He was wonderful at playing sports and loved any kind of ball.  He made all of us laugh and on the last night I sat there and watched him look up at the fireworks and just sit there in amazement. And then around the fire he sat right beside me and held my hand the whole time...Like I was his mother...I cried that whole night.
Senior camp was so much different from Junior camp but I met a lot of teenagers that are awesome and I can't wait to see them again. I also got some news while at Senior Camp...Grant; my old pastor and a great friend of ours told us that he may be getting a church up in VA and if that happens then he wants Hugh and I to move up there and he wants Hugh to be the associate pastor and the two of us be over mission work in the church. Which is exciting but also confusing at the same time. I mean here I was about to go down the water slide and Hugh comes running up to me and asks how I feel about moving to Virginia. hugh has always wanted to move there and it is a good opportunity...so we are just praying and letting things unravel.
When we got back from Camp...Hugh's dad has to be rushed to the hospital b/c he had a stroke. So he is still in the hospital and we don't really know what is going on. I am scared but then again I am ok b/c I know that we caught in time. I just don't like hospitals....the smell and everything and it just brings up too many memories that I try to forget.
But other than that everything is going well...just been real busy...miss everyone and love to all"

Which is good b/c it is like only thirty minutes away from Macon and Wesleyan so I will be able to see the stooges more. It is sad b/c I never knew how much I would miss my family as I do now. I mean I thought I would be ok b/c I had grown closer to Hugh and further from my family, but I think it hit when I had to go to my mom's and Levi wrapped himself around me and didn't want me to leave...I can still see him crying asking why I had to leave...I don't think a lot of people realize how much I miss everyone, and I know this is for the best but what can I say...I miss them. I want to cry but I am being strong for Hugh b/c the last thing he needs is me complaining about not seeing my family and being as close to them as I would like. I know that this is a learning and growing process, but why do they have to be so hard all the time??? That is what I don't understand but I will get through it.
For other news...Hugh now works at night...so I have to sleep by myself at night. You think that after twenty years of sleeping on my own I would be used to it  but it seems like these past almost six months have completely changed everything..it now feels wierd not having him beside me. How can six months change twenty years??? I don't know but it did...
I start school in September...hopefully I won't change schools again, but you know it is all good b/c I wouldn't want to move for anyone else. Well I have to go... LOVE TO ALL"

So I have my first final on Monday at eight and get this...Friday the teacher was susposed to show up for class and give us an outline of what would be on the final and look at our portfolios and guess what?!?!?!? She doesn't show...I was so mad..I mean I need this class..it's my EDUCATION class and the teacher doesn't even show for the last day of class.  I mean I should expect it when she keeps one of my papers (that has to be in my final portfolio) for three and a half months and then deicdes she has lost it and I have to rewrite it again...yeah so I am a little stressed.  I have three finals this upcoming week...and then Friday I am off to Macon.  I am so excited about Graduation I can hardly stand it.  I can't wait to see Marnai and everyone else...I know I am going to cry!!!
Hopefully my truck will be fixed in the next two weeks...just in case some don't know I hit a deer or should I say the deer rammed into the side of my truck...you can see where his head hit. Horrible...I just hate not having a car b/c then I am dependent on someone else, but I guess it is ok to be dependent on my husband.  We went and looked at SUVs on Friday...I guess some of you can figure out what that means...we are planning on adopting here very soon. Our church has already told us they would help with the cost of adopting a child from overseas...so I am so excited.  We want to adopt a boy from Mexico and a little girl from China.  Just the thought of having children is scary/exciting.  But yeah so we are preparing b/c the process can take up to two years so we have some time, but we are getting a roll on the first things.
I don't know what else to really talk about besides I miss the stooges like crazy and my one and only Big SISTER!!!! I can't wait until I see you all agian...loves and kisses from me"

first, My brother got married the friday before easter. and it was kind of bittersweet for me for more reasons than one...one I was losing a brother I was really close to and if you know who he married you will know why I say I lost him...we don't talk as much now and two I had to sit back and watch my own mother help so much with his wedding and she didn't even lift a finger in mine. so yeah it made me feel like the ""ugly duckling"" of the family...like I was enough to have my mother help at mine but she can get off of work to help the woman my brother was about to marry..FRUSTATIOn and the last thing was Hugh and I had planned on leaving that friday to get away and go to Charleston, but we had to postpone it due to thier last minute decision to get married and I HAD to be there...why does that always happen???

But anyways Hugh and I did go to Charleston and it was absolutely wonderful...it was so realxing and so beautiful.  It was good to just get away from the phone calls and life back at home and just spend time together and be in a diffferent atmosphere...so yeah I enjoyed it very much

Married life gets better and better everyday...it's so great(I am smiling right now just talking about it) he and I are growing so close...we laugh all the time about only things that we would understand...
Stooges...I look at that photo album EVERYDAY and I have pics from the wedding you guys will have to see..I hope you guys have some too...thank you all for the wonderful gift and most of all the card with those wondrful words in them...it warms my heart everytime I read them.  You guys will never know what it meant to  have you all up here to share in that special day...I LOVE YOU ALL

Imean it's been a scary week for the both of us.  Tues night we were lying in bed and he tells me that the whole left side of his body is numb...ok I know medical stuff and Iknow that is not normal...so he doesn't really tell me what is going on, but I know that that is a symptom of a stroke...well come to find out he had a mild stroke. They run in his family I mean his father had his first stroke at the age of 17. But just the fact that maybe he could be taken away from me is scary enough.  I broke the other night...I didn't mean to but I did. Iwas TRYING to be strong, but I don't know what I would do if I didn't have him in my life....I am COMPLETE with him in my life...i don't know how to live without him anymore.
On another note...you guys would be so proud. i am like the best wife ever.  I wash the dishes, wash and dry clothes and fold them and put them away EVERY DAY...not to mention I work and have school, Hugh does a lot too, but I just never thought I would be doing all this, but you know the scary thing is that it feels so comfortable like I have been doing it my whole life...Like I am meant to do it and I am susposed to...weird isn't it
Well I am excited that I will be at STUNT and get to see the GH's rock like never before...I know you guys will do AWESOME...and I will be in the stands rooting for ya.
And it's Hare's Birthday and I am missing it...man I suck as a friend...I just feel bad b/c I am not there...but you guys all know that I love you and I miss y ou all like CRAZY...esp the stooge crew...can't wait to see you and give you all HUGS...with all of my love..well I am out...got an early start to a long day...see you all soon"

I am so happy that each night we lay down next to one another and sometimes talk until one in the morning...just him holding me and knowing that we are no longer two people we are one...that is enough to make me smile and get all warm inside.

I spent my whole Christmas break moving...my parents moved b/c my dad is now a pastor at a church and we moved in the parsonage...so I thought all of it was over, but then Hugh and I got a place. Yeah and he is living there until we get married and then I will move in. I am excited about it though...I mean we went shopping one night to get all the things we needed, and I felt so different b/c I wasn't looking at just CDs and DVDs I was looking at shower curtains, and table cloths, and fabric to make curtains with...yes he and I made our own curtains...I should say that he did most of the work and I was there for moral support...actually I was hooking up the tv and dvd player while he was doing all of that.  But that night while we were just sitting there making the house ""our home"" it occured to me that this was it...this is what I have been waiting and praying for all of my life and I was actually starting a life of my own outside of my parents and thier four walls...I was making a home for me and Hugh and the children we will adopt.  scary isn't it...I am GROWING up...I am scared but I am also so estatic that it is not even funny. I mean he is my everything and I can't help but fall in love with him more and more every day.  
ok but enough of all that...school is going GREAT I can't believe how stress free everything is right this second....the drama teacm at Church is growing leaps and bounds...spiritually and physically....I know I counted at least thirty memebers at the last practice...I was blown away by all of this...I know that God is using me.

ALL WESLEYANS...I am coming down REAL soon....but not soon enough..I will be down on the 21 and 22....I am so excited about it it's not even funny....can't wait to see all of you...LOVE TO ALL"

This weekend was one hetic one..Friday I FINALLY went and got my license renewed and I was sleeping at home when Hugh called and said that his dad was in the hospital..ok yeah so I freaked out and I started calling everyone I knew and told them to start praying.  Ia sked him if he wanted me to go with him but he told me I had too much work to do so I needed to stay at home.  WEll needless to say I didn't get too much work done...I mean I couldn't after news like that I had no way of knowing if dad was ok or not...I was so scared and then it was like I was in the shower getting ready to go the youth lock in at my church and I was crying my eyes out and I simply told God ""I need a word"" and He kept repeating back to me PEACE...and after that I knew every thing was going to be ok.
Friday night I had to chaperone at a lock in at my church...after I talked ot Hugh and found out everything about his dad I decided that I HAD to go and see him, b/c I felt bad for not being up there, so I was going to get some sleep and drive up there Saturday morning after I had everything settled with the Drama Team and our fundraiser.  Well I only got thirty minutes of sleep b/c the kids kept me up all night..even though it was a BLAST and I absolutly loved it..I still had to drive up to ATL...well I made it and when I got to the hospital I was the only one there in the room with dad, so we watched the Parade and just talked about things I made sure he was ok and then I went to lunch with Guaquita(hugh's sister) and her daughter Katie.  THen hugh and his mom finally came up there and I fell alsleep on hugh's shoulder...yeah I was THAT tired...but I then left around eight o clock that night...
yeah so that  was my weekend...and I have been up since one studying and finish up my final paper in History.
I will be glad when this week or thurs gets here...then no more school for awhile...I LOVE YOU ALL and I MISS YOU GUYS"

"event","and reflect on the past semester I am amazed at how much change has happened in my life. I thought I had everything in order and then it's like everything completly surprised me...some GOOD and some BAD and then one that is GREAT! I haven't reflected on what all has happened maybe because some of it hurts too much and I try to block it out but I need to get it out...so here are some things that I have learned in the past semester and some things that I am so greatful for....
1.  I learned that no matter how hard you try sometimes you can't love someone as much as they want you to.  Yes I am talking about Jeff. Don't get me wrong I did love him, but I see now that it was just a friendly love that I tried to make into more b/c I knew that I could be content with being with him for the rest of my life, but I wouldn't be as happy as I should be. Don't get me wrong we had our good times, but we fought over some of the supidest things and I just didn't have that passion and desire for him like I should have for someone I want to spend the rest of my life with. And yeah it hurts b/c we no longer talk and for a year he and I shared a lot of memeories...but I guess instead of wishing for a friendship I should be content with the memories.
2. I saw also that no matter how far you are from TRUE friends that they will always be right there for you to help share your heavy load.  I mean I don't know what I would have done without my stooges and my big sister when it seemed like I had no one...you guys were there. YOu guys understand me and know all my little quirks...and I miss that and sometimes I want to pack everything up and move back to macon...but I know that I can't do that and I can't leave here...but I jsut wish sometimes I could be in two places at once.  Imiss our nights hanging out and wathcing Will and Grace(The third season DVD isn't the same with out you two).  BUt I do know that we will be friends for the rest of our lives b/c we have a bond that won't break...so like it or not you guys are stuck with me for the rest of your lives...LOL
3. I learned to grow in this past semester...and yes I see now that I am out growing things that I don't want to...like my fmaily I am seeing now that I have to let go a little b/c here in about three months I will have my OWN family and I can't depend on others to live my life I have to do it...GROWTH is a good thing..I used to think it was bad but now I see that it is so much easier to embrace it than it it is to deny it.
4. Lastly I have learned that the BEST THINGS COME TO YOU WHEN YOU ARE NOT EVEN LOOKING FOR THEM. I don't think anyone knows the whole story behind Hugh and I but it's the GREATEST. I wasn't looking for him, as a matter of fact I was still dating Jeff at the time I met Hugh and we became friends...as a matter of fact I knew he was the one the last time I was down at Wesleyan but I just couldn't say anything. The first time I ever laid eyes on him God told me that he was the one I was to marry...and after I met him I fell in love with him. But seeing that we were both dating other people we had to be just friends and I had to hide my feelings..which was hard b/c every night after church I would get in my car and drive home crying b/c I knew what God had promised and I didn't have it.  he would tell me before I left every night that he loved me...more than I would ever know. and that was hard b/c I thought to myself..""no I love you MORE THAN YOU WILL EVER KNOW""  and you know I spent all this time worrying and then it was like all of a sudden one night it all fell in place and now I know that I am with my soul mate and my best friend...he is all I ever wanted and I didn't even have to search he came when I least expected it.  I am so happy with him and it is amazing at how when we are together we just fit. THat is what everyone tells us that we are liek peices of a puzzle meant for each other...WE JUST FIT TOGETHER. And you know that is the greatest feeling..I have that passion and desire for him that I know will last forever...I now know one of the reasons I had to move back  home....to find my soul mate.

wow a lot has happened...guys I am ENGAGED...it's unreal...I know hare knows how I feel...I LOVE YOU GUYS WITH ALL MY HEART....and know that I MISS YOU ALL GREATLY"

I don't know where I would be if it weren't for you and all that you have done for me...I prob wouldn't have survived my first year of college.  I know that we will be friends until we are 80!! And I couldn't be happier to know that you and I are engaged at the same time and we can relate to one another about all that...you only deserve the best in life and  I know that you will stop at nothing to get it...I LOVE YOU WITH ALL OF MY GOLDEN HEART...yes it is STILL gold...and know that I admire you for your courage and strength and wisdom...you are truly special to me..and you do ROCK MY SOCKS"

"event","My holidays were FABULOUS if I can say so myself.  I went to Griffin with Hugh to see his parents and family...andI have to say that I felt at home and so loved down there.  I absolutely love his family.
And then on Thanksgiving I get a call from Hare...one that I was waiting for...b/c I knew what had happened the night before and I was just dying to know all the details. My Hare is growing up...I am so happy for her and I am just glad that I don't have to keep it a secret any longer. It was so hard not to tell her seeing that I knew like two weeks before and I promised Derrick I wouldn't tell her.  It's great...and Hare don't worry about what others think like I said in one of my past entries...YOU ARE HAPPY and that is all that matters and if ohters can't be happy for you then let it go!!! You know I love you and that I am OVERJOYED for you. And I know that Derrick will treat you like a QUEEN!!!

But anyways Hugh and I have a house now...yeah we found out about it last TUes and sometime this week we are going to go and check it out and see if we like it or not. I am just so excited...this weekend we sat down and started making out a list of things we need and it was then that it became reality that I am getting married and moving out of my house with my family. March seems too far off...but we still have A LOT to do.  I just can't wait until I don't have to say goodbye anymore and not be with him at night.  

I have one more week of school then exams next week and then I am done for this semester...WOW time has flown by. I LOVE YOU ALL AND YOU ARE ALL IN MY THOUGHTS...Marnai expect an email from me....

Oh I almost forgot...HOW 'BOUT THEM DAWGS!!!!!

I don't know what everyone thinks about me getting engaged soo quick, but as far as I care it doesn't matter to me b/c I am happy and I know that he is the one. With others it was like I had to make myself want to be with them, but with Hugh is just came with it's own time. I can't really explain it and I know that there are a few people who are upset with me about this whole thing, but as of right now I don't care...I am too happy to.

OMG...I got the BEST surprise on my birthday...a call from MY TWO BESTEST FREINDS IN THE WHOLE WORLD...Jaz and Hare...that just made my day.  you guys just don't know...I know someone cares...I mean my own mom didn't tell me Happy Birthday...so I was feeling a little unloved and then you guys come to the rescue...you will never know that means to me...NEVER...I love you girls so much and I MISS YOU guys soo much....I am coming to visit ASAP!!!!!

Kel you will LOVE this...here goes the story...
This weekend I attened a leadership conference in ATL and Hugh went with me and two other teens from our church. Well Friday night Hugh said he had to go on a errand and he would be back later, well I had no idea the errand was getting my ring... well Sat we are coming back from the whole thing and he tells me that when we get to the CHurch he has something inside he wants to show me. So we get to the church and I unlock the doors and I am waiting for him b/c he is talking to everyone outside...and keep in mind this is at like ten thirty at night and I am SOOOOO tired.  Well he comes into the church and we go into the sanctuary and he turns on only the stage lights and he leads me down to the alter and at this point I am asking him what is going on...he tells me I will see. Then out of his pocket he puts the ring box on the alter and gets down on one knee. I am in total disbelief and I am now shaking. He is all teared up and he says ""Liz You COMPLETE me and I want to make you my wife for the rest of my life...Will you marry me?"" By this time I am crying and I said YES!!!  
Yes I am engaged..and it is the BEST feeling ever in the world. I know that he is the one I want to spend eternity with and he is so perfect...don't worry girls I am bringing him to Macon...I have already had two people say that I am getting thrown in the fountain so it may be three months or so b4 I come down...HAHAHAHA...just kidding I will be down there pretty soon.  I just had to post this...and I WANT to hear all of your comments...GOOD AND BAD...so what do you guys think????"

2. Tell me two things you love about yourself. No whiney, self-deprecation allowed!

3. Look through the comments ~ when you see someone you know, tell them three things you love about them. 

4. Do this in your journal so I can tell you what I love about YOU - and if you've already done it, tell me so, so that I can go back and give you some love.

"event","SO here we go...last week I was in the hospital as many of you know. Here is why...my pump wasn't working correctly and I wasn't getting any insulin so even though my sugar wasn't as high as some times before I had NO INSULIN in my body and I went in to DKA and got REALLY REALLY sick...I didn't know it b/c I was half out of most of the time...I remember they had to do this procedure that took three hours and I still have the bruises to prove it. My mom almost freaked out b/c they siad that if my breathing didn't slow down then they might have to put me on a venalator...which is scary.  So I am now having to watch my sugar really close and be extremely careful.  And I have so many people watching out for me it's overbearing and I don't know...

I needed my stooges last weekend..I went on a retreat with my church and they first night we get up there everyone is bringing out the chocolate and I can't have any b/c everyone would get on to me and I had no snacks....it made me feel so alone and so DIFFERENT...and I could'nt talk about it b/c it seemed like no one REALLY understood...but I knew my girls from Wesleyan would just cry with me...it has been so hard here lately b/c it seems like I have been trying so hard and I don't see any results...I need to get away but finding the time is so hard.

I guess something good did come out of all this...I got to see what it truly means to have someone who loves me unconditonally.  Hugh stayed with me everynight in the hospital...the first night he had to sleep in a chair.  But the thing that got me was here I was in a hospital gown(and we know how attractive they are) and my hair is a mess and no make up and I am so sick I don't even know what is going on and I have this man beside me telling me how beautiful and wonderful I am even when I am in that state.  He told me one night while we were just talking that on Sunday when I made him leave me and go to church that he didn't want to be there and he wanted to be next to me where he belonged...ok what did I do to deserve this? He is so wonderful I mean I can't believe I finally have my soul mate..everyone tells us that we just fit together.  He is so wonderful I mean he says things sometimes that just blow me away...he is the sweetest to me.  He bought me this hugh tigger and I sleep with it everynight.  He is my backbone and when I am with him it's like something I have done my whole life.  He told me that he has fallen so deeply in love with me that it's amazing..and I have done the same.  I mean when he was next to me in the hospital it wasn't like it was awkward...it just felt so right. Everyone told me that the first day I was ICU I wouldn't let go of Hugh's hand for nothing and I wanted him by my side no matter what...I usually want my mom or dad, but I guess it now has changed.  He makes me SOOOO HAPPY...and it's amazing at how  when we kiss I get these tingles all the way to my toes...I can't put it into words....

But yeah I am alive and still busy...I have so much to do...this weekend will be one working and chatching up weekend.

HARE CALL ME WE NEED TO TALK....

LOVE TO ALL...oh yeah I forgot to do this...but Suzzi...remind me who one the UGA and FLA game...I seem to have forgotten...LOL...Love you"

Not wanting to leave.&nbsp; Friday he met me after I observed my first graders and we went shopping, and then to a football game with two other friends of ours, and all through the game we would flirt and just goof off with one another.&nbsp; It was great...he can always make me smile.&nbsp; But what happened the next day is something I will never forget.&nbsp; That Saturday we had a Singles Dinner at one of the ladies houses at our church...we spent all day cooking authentic mexican food(he is a GREAT cook)...it was like any other time we spent together just picking on each other, but it was when we went out to his car to get some games to play that when we were walking back in he kissed me on the neck...and&nbsp;I have never had tingles like I did when that happened.&nbsp; So we went in and played some games and afterwards when we were cleaning up this other guy came up to me and started talking to me and flirting...and Hugh got upset and he told me on the ride back to get my truck that it upset him and I was like why we are just friends and he was like ""Ok Whatever...you know its more"" well I didn't think much about it but when we got back to the church we were standing outside talking to some people and he just reached down and grabbed my hand...and it made me all warm inside.&nbsp; I knew that in that moment I was holding the hand of the person who would be beside me for eternity.&nbsp; And then when we kissed it was like the world stopped and allowed me to freeze that moment.</FONT></STRONG></P>

I mean when I return to school I have two papers...not wait make that THREE papers due and I haven't started one yet...why you ask b/c I don't have the time. I have come to the conclusion that I am going to have to buy a lot of caffine and stay up one night and finish everything.

BUt I do have to say that I had a wonderful time last night and this past weekend...which was spent all with one person...no and it's not anything seriuos...but I spent it with theis guy from my church Hugh...on Friday we had to perform at a fair and he was there and I rode back to the church with him and we just talked...the fair was WONDERFUL our drama team did an excellent job and I was so proud of them. Then Sat we went to watch one of the guys from our church play soccer then we went shopping for supplies to make the shoe boxes for the children in Mexico and then we spent some time just goofing off and that night we had to go to the church to show the Passion of Christ on the big screen. Sunday I went with him to his hometown b/c he had to go to a funeral and he needed support, and we ate at the Craker Barrel and then came back for church...on the ride home we had a long talk and it's so amazing at how I we can just be real with each other...I told him that I want to go into the mission fields and just do what God has called me to do and he opened his heart to me also...It's just so great having someone who feels and and is passionate about the same things as you.  Last night we made Fried Green Tomatoes...which I have to say that he can cook...it was just wonderful...I didn't get to bed until late and I overslept this morning but it was all worth it.  This weekend we are spending most of it together too...for the next few months it looks like I will spending most of my time at church or going somewhere for church with Hugh.  Which isn't a bad thing...oh on the 27th of November he and I are going to see the Nutcracker at the Fox Theater...that is my gift to him for Christmas...he was so excited when I told him about it...I am excited too...I love things like that...
BUt anyways I am rambling...I have to go and get to class...two more classes then FALL BREAK...YAYYYYYY"

And brandi is the greatest but I realized last night that when her and my brother get married in December that everything will change and i will lose the two people I am close to up here...I mean I know I will get to see them it will just be different.  Maybe that is why Hugh is in my life...he is this guy from Church that is such a wonderful friend...he is like Ashley Hare but just a guy...I mean we laugh and joke with each other all the time but then there are times that we have these serious discussions that I pour my heart out to him and he does the same with me.  He is the closest friend I have right now...but he still doesn't compare to my stooges and Marnai.  He is a guy and there are some things you just can't tell guys.  Hare and Jaz you guys would love him...he is just so funny and he tells you like it is...just like us...LOL.
I know God put him in my life in order for me stay sane.  I mean everyone tells us that we must have been friends forever, but the wierd thing is that we haven't.  I guess it's just a spiritual bond we share.  

Yeah my brother is getting married in December...FAST I know...it's shocking..I thought I would get married before he did.  I mean with me and Jeff I thought for the longest time he and I would be together forever...but I guess that is how life is...it's funny sometimes..I mean Brandi and Josh have only been together for a bout two months now and they are getting married in two months and I spent a whole year with Jeff and now we aren't together.  I know I am going to cry at the wedding b/c I know that Josh and I will not be as close as we are now b/c he will have other priorities...he will be starting a family and I will be single...but hey we all have to grow up and I am doing that every day.

"event","and well just real busy and I haven't had time for anything here lately besides what needs to get done. Drama at the church is my life right now.  That is where I was all weekend, but it's ok I LOVE IT and no one will take that away from me.  

TOday was the first day I thought about Jeff...and it's got me thinking that maybe I wasn't in love  with him as much as I thought I was I mean I should be hurting right now...but I am not...I know that sounds so cold of me, but I don't know what else to say.  I feel like a bad person b/c the last time we talked he sounded hurt and heartbroken and I just sat there with no emotions...what is wrong with me?? Am I that heartless?? I don't know it just seems like I should be crying my eyes out and wearing the same clothes for a week, but it's the complete opposite...I am LIVING and that is what scares me I think...I am living and I am happy...

Hare...We HAVE to talk soon...there is so much I want to tell you and I know that you will understand and be happy for me at the same time...I talk to Jaz and I mentioned that you guys should come up to visit me soon...everyone here wants to meet you guys...b/c I talk about you all the time...I MISS YOU so much
Marnai...sorry I haven't been the best little sister here lately...I am trying though...I will email you tonight and catch you up on things...
Jaz...I enjoyed our talk last night...I LOVE YOU
Anastasia...where have you been...don't forsake me just b/c you have a girlfriend...remember it was I that loved you first...LOL JK I know you are happy and that's good

LOVE TO ALL I HAVE TO GO"

"event","well I did it and I bet some of you will be surprised and some of you won't...Jeff and I are no longer together. It happened this morning at six o clock I called him last night b/c I just needed to talk about somethings on my mind and when we talked this morning I told him I needed to have my space and some time...b/c I have so much on my plate and for the next couple of months all my weekends are busy...and I don't feel like I am putting 100% into the relationship and as my CLOSE friends know it has been a roller coaster when it comes to me and him...y'all know the real stuff behind and it what goes through this brain...and you know what I NEED you guys right now b/c there is so much I want to say but no one to say it to...HARE, JAZ, MARNAI, STASIA...I need to talk and you guys are my backbone...call me or something...

Ohter than that I have been ok..I mean I am ok now but you know it still is change...I am alone...and that is what scares me...but tonight I have to go and do drama...and you know I am so excited...gosh where are my stooges when I need to talk...I know we are all busy but we all need to catch up...Hare and Jaz you guys need to seriously take a ""road trip"" if you know what I am hinting at...

"event","another update in the same week...I am getting too much time on my hands...LOL I wish. I got out of class early and decided I would update.

Jeff is leaving today to go to Michigan...and I am sad..I mean I know we don't see each other like we used to and we are 2 1/2 hours away from each other, but it's the whole fact that he will be further away and that makes my heart hurt... but I know he will have a good time at the Michigan game with his sister...so I just hope he gets there with out and complications.

Not much has really been going on.  Same as usual I come to school, then work, then home, then homework...busy as always and trying to find time to actually breathe. 

Jaz I am so excited to hear about your A...I am so happy that school is going well for you...I miss you and love you so much

Hare...I miss talking to you online...I know I haven't been on as much...we need to have an heart to heart...

Marnai...I LOVE YOU and miss you more than words can say...I want to visit soon but all my weekends are taken for the next three weeks or so...so we will see"

"event","I am FINALLY updating.  SO much has went on that I don't know where to start.
I missed LINKs weekend and not b/c I wanted to...I wanted to be there SOOOO bad but my mom didn't want me to go b/c she was afraid about the weather and some of the roads were closed to Macon so I couldn't have came even if I was allowed to.  I know that my wonderful girls did a great job...you guys were in my thoughts all weekend...just think all those sweat and tears payed off. I am so proud of you guys y'all just don't know.

So yeah on THurs we had some TERRIBLE weather here...ten tornadoes touched down within a matter of two hours.  This subdivison near my house got completely destryoed and while I was at work one touched down near by. It was so scary but wierd too. I drove up at school this morning and it's doesn't look the same...I mean the whole town...Franklin county got the worse of so of course I didn't have school on friday b/c the roads were flooded.

Friday my brother got engaged and as much as I want to be happy for him there's a part of me that thinks he may be going too fast...but hey its his life...its a pretty ring and they seem happy together so I guess I will just keep my mouth shut about all of it.

I miss my stooges more than anything...I need to talk to people and it seems like here every one is occupied with something else and I just bottle all my feelings up.  And I know you guys want to talk to me....at least I hope so...

well I have to go and study for a quiz...this week isn't any slower for me...LOVE TO ALL"

"event","I will be in Macon tomorrow! Which is so exciting if I can say so...I am so ready to see my Stooges again...and to be a little part of the weekend.

Yesterday I recieved twleve long stemed pink roses from Jeff.  He knew that I have been having a horrible two weeks so he wanted to brighten my day which it did.  Everyone at work was in shock that he just sent me roses just b/c!!!

I am so busy...this week alone I have already had two test and two quizes, two papers due and tomorrow I have another test and another paper due!!! I don't know when all this is going to settle down...I just want it to very soon.  I am just worn out with school and work and everything else in my life....

I hope I get to come to Macon and get away from life for a little while and laugh like crazy!!
LOVE TO ALL....LOTS OF IT"

In other news, it will be a year this weekend for Jeff and I. And that brings a lot of  thinking...for me...it's just difficult, I mean I have talked to my pastor about some things and he said somthing to me that hit me hard...I don't want to even think about it right now...it's all I have thought about since Sunday...I HATE thinking sometimes.... But I am not going to let it get me down...too much right now is good to dwell on the bad.

two o clock can not come soon enough....and I can't get to Wesleyan fast enough...I CAN""T WAIT!!!!!"

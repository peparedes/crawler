"event","Well, started at 11:00 Sunday night. At 11:00 on the dot i had 4-5 messages pop up and a phone call from Tyler all within a 10 second period! I tried talking to everyone..but that didn't work at all! haha! They all wanted to wish me happy birthday on GA time! haha! I thought that was funny! I got a couple phone calls during the middle of the night and woke up at 7:15 (8:15 GA time...also the time when i was born) to my mom's 5th grade class singing happy birthday to me! It was so funny! So before i went to my classes i noticed that the night before I had spilled a bottle of fingernail polish on the brand new carpet in my living room...So after i went to my classes I made a trip to walmart to get some carpet cleaner and some other stuff. Most of it is up, but there is now a big orange spot on the carpet instead of a red spot...grrr! Leslie Myer cooked me dinner for my birthday, and melanie stopped buy to drop off my present! I got like a billion messages on facebook and about 100 calls. Thats about it for my birthday...not too exciting at all! Well, I have to go to cheerleading! Bye!"

"event","BUT ITS THE WEEK OF MY BIRTHDAY! :-D Anyway! I last week was horrible! Lol! I decided not to go home b/c my youth group held their Desciple Now retreat...and all the high school girls stayed at my house! Not a good way to relax...So friday I went to stunt, and I met this girl named Morgan, she was telling me that there was a stunt clinic in Tusca-Loser all day saturday and that she and some other ppl from Auburn were driving up in the morning..she invited me...so thats what i did Saturday...Then we started talking some more..and she was talking about how she had been set up on this blind date to go to a toga party...well...I knew phi tau was having one, so i asked her who she was going with...yeah..take a WILD guess! Lol! She was going with Alan. Right after we were talking about it Justin Ford called me and asked me to go, so Morgan and I ended up getting ready together. Well, she ended up getting totally trashed by around 10:00..but then again so was everyone else. At that point i just figured we weren't going anymore...so when I got home at 1:15, I decided to stay up and watch some tv until 3:30 instead of going to bed. Well, I got a phone call at 5:30 from Morgan asking me if it was ok if I drove. So The 2 guys that were supposed to ride with us came over to my place without Morgan..I thought it was kinda funny! Haha! The stunt class was a lot of fun...and a lot of help. I never realized how good the Bama cheerleaders were...they were AWESOME! But I would NEVER want to cheer for Bama! YUCK! ;-) I called Lindsey Brown and my cousin Mark when we were on lunch..but they were both out of town. After lunch..I started feeling really bad..my stomach was hurting..and I was just exhausted! I stunted for another hour and a half or so...but most of the time after lunch, me and Emily Ann (another girl who is trying out for cheerleader at Auburn) just kinda stood around. I thought i was gonna fall over! So I made Lee drive home and I laid down the back seats and went to sleep on the way home! Last night I just hung out here for a while..there was NO way that I was going out! Well, thats just about it! :-D Bye!"

"event","So its 4:17am...I'm taking a study break...but this study break might just turn into the end of studying for the ""night""! This week I'm SUPER busy! Anyway, lets recall the last couple weeks:

Miss Katy Morgan visited me a couple weekends ago. We had a good time, and she really hit it off w/ some of my friends...esp Danny! Lol! I snuck her into Highlands w/ my id. I really enjoyed her stay! Hope she decides to come to Auburn! :-D Last week I didn't have any tests or anything, so I had a GREAT week! :) We had our first cheerleading clinic. It went really well! Leslie and I spent a couple hours in the chapter room last Wednesday working on the cheers and teaching Tiger Rags to Laura! Lol that was one of the funniest things i've seen in a long time! (PS--I lOVE YOU LAURA!!!) After I finished practicing, my sister Lauren and her friend Lindsay came to visit me. They stayed until Friday around 1ish...I took them to Encounter and they sat through my English class and part of choir practice. Friday after I was finished with my classes we went to eat at Toomers and looked around for a little bit. I had to get Melanie's birthday present since it was her birthday. 3:30 rolled around and I went to stunt out on the intermural fields. That went pretty good, there weren't many girls out there, I think a bunch of people went out of town! Anyway, that night I went to dinner w/ Melanie and some of her friends and then we went to AGR to see Trotline. I'd say about 2/3 of Phi Tau was there, so we felt pretty comfortable. After DDing Melanie and Katie around I crashed. Saturday I slept until 1:15 and then lounged around for the rest of the day! It was soo great! :-D That concludes the excitement of the weekend. So Monday was just a regular day, except I had another cheer clinic at 6 and then choir practice from 7:30-9:30. Tuesday came around, and well, I had two midterms. One in World Lit 2 and the other in my Organismal Bio lab. I also had a choir concert too!! So that leads me to now...I'm studying for my world history 2 exam that I have tomorrow. I was at the library from about 10pm until 2am. Then Justin came over to my place to study somemore...he left around 3. And now I'm just taking a break! Anyway! So tomorrow I have to turn in my nutrition journal (that i just finished writing a few mins ago) and take my World History exam. I also have formal chapter tomorrow night followed by greeksing practice! I'm going to die! And then Thursday I have the second part to my English midterm. I hope all my grades come out good...right now my grades aren't looking so hot...but I'm really trying! Then I have my first Pi Chi meeting on Thursday night..yes i got my lab moved! Yay! I'm excited! And then of course I'm going to Encounter. I'm trying to decide if i'm gonna go home on friday or not. My birthday is on Monday, and I'd like to spend some time w/ my family...but then again..if I'm going to do something with my friends for my birthday, i need to stay in town cuz I have choir tour next weekend...and we won't get into what I think about that! Oh...and dont even try to ask me what I want for my birthday...cuz i really dont know...I still haven't told my dad anything...I think I'm just gonna take a raincheck w/ him! lol. Anyway...I better get back to studying! I'll try and be better at this! I promise!!!"

"event","I just got home not too long ago from my Single's Valentines Day Party! Kelan and I thought it would be a lot of fun to have a party...and so she Jayme and Alison had the party at their place. We ordered pizza and had cookies and candy. We also decorated brown paper bags with our names and passed out the little valentines day cards that we used to get in 1st grade and stuff! It was soo much fun! We also played one of my favorite games ever! MOFIA!!! lol..I love playing that game! Anyway, I'm exhausted! I had a busy weekend!! My mom and Tim came on Friday night, it was the first time that they got to see my new apartment! Thursday night I didn't go to sleep until 5:30am (friday morning) b/c of my Organismal test! Yuck!!! I woke up at 8:30 and then went to my 3 classes. At 12 I came home and started cleaning my apartment from top to bottom! Then when my parents got here we went to Phi Tau to get the last of my stuff from the house, but instead of getting one of my mattresses we ended up with a box springs that wasn't mine! So we just figured that we'd take it back and get my mattress in the morning! So my mom and tim took me Chelsea and Matt out to dinner at Outback! It was a lot of fun spending time with them! Well, Saturday afternoon (12is) I go to Phi Tau to get my mattress....well, when i found it in another room...there was a sword...yes a sword stuck through it!! So we loaded up the mattress and then took Austin out to lunch for a late birthday present! After my parents left he hung out w/ me at my apartment for a little bit...and then the topic of the mattress came up again...well..he confessed to me that he was the one that stabbed my matress w/ the sword...the thing is...if i had gotten it Friday night when i got the rest of my matresses it would have been fine! Austin didn't do it until Saturday morning around 3:30-ish AM! I thought that was sooo funny b/c he wouldn't tell me until after my mom and tim left! Lol Anyway, Austin invited me to dinner w/ his mom and grandparents and brother for his and his grandfathers birthdays...So we went to Cock of the Walk...that place was pretty good! I'd never been there before! So after dinner I just went and hung out w/ all the guy at the house! Then came home and went to bed! Anyway...thats about all there is to my weekend!!! 

Pray requests: 
Joe's knee injury! Let's hope it isn't serious!
My Genomic Biology test that I have on Thursday!
That I can get my thursday lab moved so I won't miss my Pi Chi meetings
That me, melanie, kelly and laura can find a place to live for next year!

I think thats all for now! I'll try and keep all you fans updated with upcoming events! ;) Goodnight everyone!!"

"event","God amazes me! Isn't it just totally awesome how he provides us with things that we long for?!  Well, I got that something tonight! Lately I've been asking God to send me someone. With V-day coming closer...the longing has been growing bigger. Tonight at Encounter Matt talked to us about dating and the keys to a successful relationship. But during all this talk, I realized even more that God will provide me with someone on his own time...not mine.  I'll touch back on that later! Anyway...for those of you who missed it...here are a few of my notes from tonight. 

5 problems in dating:
1. Too much too soon
   *Even when you feel like your heart is jumping out of your chest for someone, don't say/do too much too soon. 
   *Love is patient
   *Tame the tongue
2. No Boundries
   *If it becomes sexual, it's too far and time to step away.
   *""Keep it vertical in your heart and on the couch"" -Matt
       **Keep Jesus in the center of your heart and relationship!!
   *Bedrooms are for sleeping alone
       **Sharing a bed is meant for marriage. Even if you aren't having sex, it can cause thoughts of it
   *""The sun will rise tomorrow so meet for breakfast""
       **Don't spend all night together even if you're awake. meet for breakfast in the AM and you'll have more to say
3. Keep Christ at the center of the relationship!!!
   *Relationships are meant to praise God together and grow closer to him together.
   *No missionary dating
4. Be careful when speaking FOR Jesus!
   *Saying too much too soon
       **""Jesus has put it on my heart to pursue you/that we should be together/you're the one!""
           ***If you feel this way, tell a close friend and ask them what they think!
   *Be careful when you're speaking for people.
5. When you're crazy in love, your relationship is better off when you have a life outside of each other!
   *You'll have more to talk about

Scriptures: 
""Delight yourself in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart."" Psalms 37:4

For Guys: 
1 Timothy 3
Ephesians 5:25-33

For Girls:
Ephesians 5:22-24
Song of Songs 2:7

Pray for your future spose constantly. 


K...Thats part of it...but wow...there was so much more!  Right now I'm am more content than ever. Why? Well one of the songs we sang tonight said it all...

""NO ONE HAS EVER LOVED ME LIKE THE WAY YOU LOVE ME/WRAP YOUR ARMS AROUND ME!""

While we were singing this...I realized just how true it was...and not only that..but NO ONE WILL ever love me like the way He loves me! His love is enough!  I knew this before, but geez...tonight it just really hit me hard. I'm on God's time now!"

"event","I know I know! Hard to believe! TWICE IN ONE WEEK!!! This is CRAZY! lol! Anyway, I didn't go to any of my classes on Tuesday because i felt so sick! I slept 12 hours Monday night! I slept right through my alarm clock for class! So I went to the doctor. After two hours, a blood test and about 10 mins talking to the doctor, he decided that I have some bacterial infection and said that I was developing symptoms of a sinus infection! WONDERFUL! So he gave me two prescriptions. I went to CVS hoping that I would run into my favorite pharmacy tech Dan, but he wasn't there! Sad times!! He is so hot! haha! Later I went over to the Phi Tau house for formal rush, that was fun...NOT! I kinda felt bad for the guys because they didn't have any rushees show up. But after tonight they now have 4 pledges! So I went home and took some of my medicine and after I took my first dose, I started feeling kinda weird...kinda anxious. I tried to go to sleep, but I couldn't so I stayed up watching Ashlee Simpson's tv show. They had about 6 episodes on back to back. During the show I decided that I'm absolutely in love with Ryan Cabrera...I mean, I LOVE his songs, but I'd never seen him before..and man he's a cutie! haha! Anyway, I finally fell asleep after a while. Today was a pretty good day, I went to all my classes, we did stadiums in aerobics today, that was fun! I took a short nap before I went to chapter, and then after chapter I went with Alison and Jayme to the Auburn-Alabama basketball game.  At half time Auburn was presented with two trophies (from the Iron Bowl), a check for winning the Poniac Game Changing Play, and People showed up and announced us National Champions! That was awesome! Anyway, we were about 10 points behind the entire game until there was like a minute left in the game...we came within ONE POINT!! It was awesome even though we lost by 5! Haha! It was a lot of fun! I wish we had a decent basketball team! Oh well! I'll take football over basketball any time! :-D hehe! Well, tomorrow is gonna be a long day, but I think I'm going to the Shane and Shane concert tomorrow night instead of going to Encounter! It should be fun! Maybe I'll update soon! Think I can do three in one week?!?! haha! We'll see! Night!"

"event","What a weekend!!! Formal was awesome! Thursday night at Encounter I got a little uneasy about the whole weekend.  We left Friday afternoon and got to New Orleans at about 10:30-11. Once we got checked into our hotel we went out to some Irish Pub for a little bit, and the me, Austin, Eric and Mallory tried to go to The Funky Butt (the jazz bar that I went to with Chelsea) but it was closed so then we just headed out to Bourbon Street and just to walk around.  Saturday morning we woke up around 9:30 or so and took turns taking showers before we went to eat at this place called Mothers. Justin Ford wanted to go eat here so bad! So we waited in a line OUTSIDE of the restraunt for 30 mins before we finally got in to take our order. It was pretty good, and the waitresses were so much fun! After that we stopped by the hotel room and then went to Jackson Square. But once we got there, it started to rain and all the entertainers left. So I went back to the hotel to get my rainshoes and then we went to some bar that was on Bourbon Street. They had a live band, and the whole place was filled with Auburn fans (Lambda Chi had their formal down there this weekend too). One half of the bar was Lambda Chis and the other side Phi Taus. It was like a big band party.  We had a blast! At one point though, some girl came up to me and tried to give me a shot.  It was in a test tube, and she'd put the test tube in her mouth to give people the shots so from certain angles it looked like she was kissing that person.  Well, I told her no..but she kept coming towards me with the shot in her mouth..Austin was kinda pulling me away from her, but the other guys were cheering her on! They want me to drink sooo bad its funny sometimes! Anyway, Melanie FINALLY saved me and grabbed the lady and told her ""NO! She doesn't drink!"" The lady felt bad and gave me a hug it was kinda funny though! Then I sat down and Vernan decided to give me a lap dance...that was a little interesting...But overall the day was alot of fun! Austin and I finally left to go to a haunted ghost tour with a few others on the trip.  It was a lot of fun, but not worth the $25 Austin paid for both of us. It wasn't what I thougth it would be, but i still enjoyed it. Once that was over, we managed to see the end of the first Mardi Gras parade...that was interesting...the people were dressed up as sperm...Anyway, then we went to get ready for the formal. Once we got to the formal, we had a blast! It was FREEZING by this point in the night, so I didn't go out on the balcony much. They had a DJ that liked to play old school stuff. Some of the songs I haven't heard in YEARS!!  Austin's knee and elbow were bothering him, but we still got to dance and have fun. All my pictures are interesting because I had drunk people taking most of them! haha! So sorry about the ones that are a little off center! Here's the site: http://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/autigercourt/my_photos

I also finally posted my pictures from the Sugar Bowl! :-D Well, now that I'm back in Auburn, I'm sick, so I'm gonna go take some medicine and go to my Greek Sing meeting! Leave me some comments! :-D"

A lot of people were worried about me moving to an apartment by myself, but I'm totally enjoying it! I still have some decorating to do, and I have to figure out what I'm doing with my matresses and trundle bed. Oh well! I'll get moved in sometime this semester! :) Speaking of the new semester, classes are gonna be tough this time round.  Between Genomic Bio, Organismal Bio, World History and World Lit, I'm gonna be reading constantly...well...at least I SHOULD be reading constantly, but the question is, will I actually DO my homework?! haha! So I this past weekend was a lot of fun! I went to Athens and stayed with Charlotte! We had lots of fun! Friday night we went to the gymnastics meet and then Greg took us to dinner w/ all the UGA gymnasts' parents. After that we stayed up until like 3:30 working on the most impossible puzzle ever! Haha! Saturday Cody drove down and took me to lunch. It was a lot of fun spending some time w/ my best friend's boyfriend! Haha! Saturday night me and Char went to Tasty World in downtown Athens to watch Kalen and Gabe play.  They were AWESOME! Everyone go check them out! They have some of their music on their website (www.gabrielyoung.com) They also have their tour list!  Anyway! Go check them out!  Plus they're both really cute! :-) haha! Anyway, Sunday I drove back to Dalton and then me my mom and mallory went to Chattanooga to look for a dress for this formal i have on Saturday. We didn't find anything, so on Monday me my mom, mallory, Pryce, and her mom all went to Atlanta to look for dresses. I finally found one at like 6pm! Then I had to take it to get it altered. The lady was totally awesome and stayed an hour after the time she was supposed to close in order to finish my dress so I wouldn't have to make a drive back! Today I went to my classes and then hung out w/ Brooke, I SOO miss her! After that I went to visit Melanie and me her and Meghan went to eat at Taco Bell then we all went over to the Phi Tau house for poker night! Anyway, I'm pretty excited about the formal this weekend in New Orleans. Melanie and Meghan are both going too! Its gonna be a lot of fun! YAY!  So if Chelsea actually talks me into going to Mardi Gras, I will have been to New Orleans 3 times in 2 months...and I mean...my first time ever going was New Years! Geez! haha! Anyway, I'll try to remember to update after formal! MAYBE even before formal! haha! I'm out!"

I'm back home in Dalton now, but I want to go back to Auburn! I'm kinda sad b/c I moved out of my apartment. I'm going to miss Jackie, Shanna and Nicole...but it was just being the odd man out. But I'm excited about my new apartment. Its cool! It's got an upstairs and a downstairs! LOL! Anyway, I'm trying to think whats been going on. Umm, I went to the Phi Tau Christmas party...I didn't want to go, but I ended up having a lot more fun than I even imagined! Laura Linder and Ashley Austin were there, so we all just stuck together! OH YEAH! Wednesday night, the night before I left Auburn, I went ice skating with the Wright sisters (Kelan, Alison and Jayme) and some of their neighbors! We had soo much fun!! I'll post pictures on my picture site (http://photos.yahoo.com/autigercourt) later! Since I've gotten back to Dalton I haven't done much! I haven't seen anyone or anything! I've been working and I went to tumbling class on Thursday night.  I did my tuck again by myself!  If I could only find a gym down in Auburn and practice like once a week, I think I could have it by tryouts. Yes..I'm still planning on trying out for cheerleader again! Well, I gotta go!

Yay...we won the SEC Championship...But that's not what we had our eyes on! We wanted ORANGES! You know what I mean! the BCS Orange Bowl aka this years national championship! Today was a sad day on the Plains. Others teams just dont know how it feels! They don't understand! But just think about it! If you're team had gone undefeated...you would be in the SAME position as us...undefeated but no way to play for the national championship! Anyway...enough of that! 

The game was a ton of fun! Friday and Saturday I stayed w/ Melanie. I got to see Jimmy, and my tech boys (even two that were sleeping that prolly dont even remember me being there!) COLE SCORED!!! Actually he recovered a fumble in the end zone! But I dont care! I'm proud of him! I realized even more how much I hate UT fans when they started shouting cheers while we had players down on the field! I dont care what game it is or what team you're playing...thats tasteless!  :) I ran into my mom's cousin and his family after the game. This weekend was great! I'll never forget it! 

Well, I have a long week ahead of me. Tomorrow I have a chemistry test, Wednesday a paper due, and finals begin on Friday. Pray for me...please!"

"event","So my Tigers had a perfect season!! And what a season it's been! :-D Anyway, Friday I drove up to TuscaLOSER and met up with Lindsey Brown! It was good to see her, then I went to dinner with my aunt, uncle and cousins and a bunch of other Bama fans..that was fun....uhh...yeah...Then me and Lindsey and some of her friends went to Theta Chi, my cousin's fraternity. Trotline was there! And just incase you've forgotten...Trotline is my FAVORITE! :-D We went around to a bunch of other fraternities..and I ran into about 10-15 ppl that I knew from Auburn..It was GREAT! Saturday we woke up at about 10:30..and went to lunch at the TriDelt house and then went to the game. For the first half I sat in the Bama section with my aunt, uncle, and one of my cousins! Well...I completely take all the blame for us playing soo horribly in the first half! Apparently when I sit in the home section at an away game, we lose (last year at UGA and GA Tech I sat in their sections) But when I sit in the Auburn section...we win (Music City Bowl, UT, Ole Miss). So during halftime I walked down to the Auburn section and ran into a bunch of my Phi Tau boys. They let me squeeze into the front row with them! The seats were AWESOME!! And as you know, Auburn dominated the 3rd and 4th quarters! So I apologize for the scare! After the game was over, some of the football players ran over to our section, and Bret Holliman threw his gloves into the crowd..and well, I caught it! Joff told me that if I gave him the glove that he would give me an A in Poltical Economy..but I told him that I didn't believe him! The entire Auburn section stuck around the stadium (aka Jordan-Hair West) for about 30 mins or so...It was fun! We sang ever song, yelled every cheer and had a blast!! So after the game I went to eat dinner with my aunt and uncle again at Golden Rule. Then Lindsey and I decided to head back to Dalton...yeah..at 10:00pm Central Time! So we got to Dalton at about 2am EST...lol! So I went to bed when I got home...and had to be at work at 10 am...funfun! Anyway, work really wasn't that bad! But I ended up going to sleep at 3:30pm and woke up at 8:30pm...yeah..that was great! Anyway..I gotta be at work at 1 tomorrow, so I'm off to bed!! Nighty Night folks and WAR DAMN EAGLE!! 11-0 baby!!!"

"event","So..I've gotten to be really bad at this update thing! Sorry guys! Anyway, this week was AWESOME! The RV parking lots were just about full on Wednesday afternoon, and by Friday afternoon...Auburn was about to explode due to the high number of people in town! Friday afternoon Amy and Matt tooke me, Cole and Lindsay to lunch, and Tyler came into town just as I finished eating! After Tyler and I ran a few errands, we headed over to my sorority dorm to meet up for the Burn the Bulldogs parade. It was FOREVER before the parade started..but once it got on a roll...it was a lot of fun!! The parade marched right into Downtown Auburn to Toomers Corner where they had the road blocked off, and a stage set up for the Pep Rally! It was sooooo much fun! After that Tyler and I walked back to the car and went to grab some lunch and then headed to the David Crowder concert! It was AWESOME! I loved it! After the concert I had to run a few more errands and then ended up coming home...to a HUGE party...I wasn't too happy about walking into my apartment w/ a ton of drunk ppl and my apartment being TRASHED..but I really wasn't happy with the fact that I had to go to bed w/ music blaring and ppl screaming in my ear! But Tyelr and I managed... Saturday morning I had to be at the stadium at 8:15am for choir practice. After that Tyelr and I walked over to College Gameday..and hung out there for a while! there were SOO many people there! After sitting there for about 2 hours we walked over to our tailgate and ate lunch and then headed BACK to Tigerwalk! Tigerwalk was freakin AWESOME! The guys were soooooo pumped!!! I LOVE AUBURN!!!! :-D After that, Tyler went into the game w/ Lindsay and a bunch of my sorority sisters. I on the other hand had to go change in to my stupid choir dress so I could walkin into the stadium with the band! So I waited for about an hour or so for the band to show up and FINALLY got in the game! I changed into my regular clothes and waited for the game to start... Right when I got to my seat...The entire student section started BOOing and chanting ""GEORGIA SUCKS! GEORGIA SUCKS!"" to some UGA fan that was in the middle of the student section in a David Greene jersey.  That made me laugh..I have never seen an entire student section attack one person like that! It was soooo funny! THEN they did it to some other guy! haha! Anyway...the game got underway..and we gave them the spanking they've been asking for! Final Score Auburn 24-UGA 6! WAR DAMN EAGLE!!! I got to sing at half time,and that was a lot of fun! The bad part was changing in the stands before and after half! haha! I got some strange looks..but I kept myself fully covered at all times! :) After the game, Tyler and I marched to Toomers! Again I say: I LOVE AUBURN!!! :-D Toomers was AWESOME!!! I would have pictures to show...but all my pictures from the day somehow got erased! I was SOOO upset! But thats ok cuz Keven told me that he would send me some of his best pictures from the game and Toomers! After we met my parents up at Toomers, Tyler and set off for the tailgate again. We ate some dinner and then came back to my apartment to take showers...After we got ready we went over to Cole's apartment to see all the Dalton folk! It was good to see everyone! :) We left there and headed over to the Phi Tau house for a little bit to see Wayne Mills Band...It was ok...but not all that great. So Tyler and I went to Sonic...to eat YET AGAIN! and then came home to go to bed. Tyler is on her way home now..and everyone else left at my apartment is now cleaning! My mom and Tim are on their way back to Auburn for my Choir Concert at 2:30! Well, I better start getting ready!!! This weekend was amazing!!! WAR DAMN EAGLE!!! 10-0!!!! SEC WEST CHAMPS!!!! and best of all.....A WIN OVER UGA! :-D"

We went to the Dalton football game to watch them get their butts whooped by LFO! We ended up leaving the game early, but I was glad I went b/c I got to see Tyler, Aaron, Brittany Ford, Kent, Katy, and many many more people! After we got back to Dalton we stopped by O'Charlies to see Chris, Cy and Ben. It was good seeing all of them again! Laura and I then left there to go to Walmart to buy stuff for the game! We ended up staying up until like 2:30 or so Dalton time to make posters for the game! Mine said ""Auburn is the only Ten-I-See"" It was AWESOME! and Laura's said ""Peace up A-Town""  I woke up at 6:45 Saturday morning and Laura and I were on the road by 8:30.  We made it to Knoxville by 10:30 and made it to the site of ESPN Gameday in about 20 mins or so.  I WAS ON GAMEDAY!!!!! :-D LOL anyway, we tailgated all day...that was soo much fun! Laura and I then headed over to Tiger Walk, but then Auburn fans told us that they started earlier and that we had missed it! I was really upset! I hadn't missed a TigerWalk at all this year!!! :( Finally my cousin Blake and I went in the stadium...I'm not gonna lie..i was scared to death going into this game! My stomach was in KNOTS!! That game was the best Auburn game I've ever seen! and I've seen my share of Auburn games!!! We played so close to perfect it was CRAZY!!!!!  All I heard from a VOLS fan at gameday was that the staduim will be the loudest thing I've ever heard...well...it wasn't even close!! Auburn fans were so loud that at the end of the 3rd quarter UT's QB ran the clock down so they could get on the other end of the field!! Haha! The refs started feeling bad for them and gave them 2 pass interferance calls..that weren't even close to being that!! Oh well! Anyway, final score 34-10 WAR DAMN EAGLE BABY! Auburn Tigers are now 5-0! Anyway Sunday Laura and I drove to Oneonta(sp) and we did laundry and watched the game AGAIN! lol We just couldnt' get enough of it! I finally got back to Auburn last night at like 9:30 and was passed out by 10:30! I had a test today in COMP 1000, I have a test tomorrow in Chemistry, and TWO test on Wednesday in STATS and World Lit. Wish me luck! Well, I hope I get my voice back soon!! Dr. Smith isn't going to be happy with me tomorrow! :\ Well ""Peace out A-Town!"""

Omg...we're horrible! We have a game tomorrow night against ChiO...I dont want to play, but I feel like I'd be letting everyone down if I dont go. So I'm going. Well I ended up hurting my knee at practice...its gonna be nice and purple tomorrow. After practice I just got in one of my weird moods again. Its one of those moods where I feel lonely..and all i wanna do is sit in a quiet place away from everyone...but usually when i do this it just makes me even more depressed. So instead I called up Cowboy Matt and he went and ate dinner with me at Wendys. It was great spending time with him! I've missed him so much! I dont know if he knew that i was in my weird depressed mood...but he definitely helped cheer me up some! I really wish that he still lived right upstairs from me.  Thats what I miss the most about the dorms. I loved having all my friends just a door down or just upstairs from me. That was so much fun and not to mention convenient! Well, I'm going to go have some quiet time now and then I'm off to bed! Pray for me...not only for this weird mood to go away..but I get my chem test back tomorrow! :\ Yikes!

So I decided to get up and be productive! I went to the post office and mailed my rent. Then I went and got my oil changed and got new windshield wipers! The wipers excite me b/c they have been squeeking for the past 5 or 6 months now! I was so excited when I was driving down the road and they didn't make ANY noise at all! So after that I went to chemistry. Then came back to the apartment and started to feel like crap again. So once again I crawled up in the fetal position in my bed and slept. Today I missed Concert Choir for the second time ever! Last year I missed class once because my mom was in the hospital for what ended up to be a kidney stone. Anyway today should have been super busy...but a lot of stuff was canceled. Flag Football was canceled and I didn't go to the swap that we had with Sigma Pi b/c I still wasn't feeling all so great! Laura Linder got back to Auburn tonight and we ran to the mall to pick up a few things, and while we were out we had some good conversation! I think part of the reason I haven't felt good lately is b/c I have a lot on my mind...maybe i'll give details another time...who knows! Anyway I have a test tomorrow in stats that I haven't studied for yet, so I guess i'm gonna go look at that! Goodnight everyone! Please keep me in your prayers!"

Anyway, today has been a lazy day! Last night Lane and I went to visit the Phi Tau boys, man, judging from their front yard, you'd think the hurricane already hit!  Yesterday they had their first Drunk Olympics. This was one of Alan's wild ideas that I never imagined anyone would actually go through with! Apparently it was a huge success!! When Lane and I got there, everyone that was left was completely trashed! After we left there Lane decided to spend the night with me! So we came back to my apartment and hung out for a bit before we decided to go to bed! We woke up and she decided to head back to her dorm. I've just been sitting around the apartment all day...I have done NOTHING! I should prolly be studyin for Chemistry or maybe even statistics...but I dont feel like it! Not a good way to start studying for my first two tests..! Oh well!! Anyway, the whole point of this post is because I'm so freakin bored...so I guess I'll quit boring you!! :) Have a good day!!!

Matt came up with the idea to go as Humphry Bogart and Lauren Bacall. The party was awesome! There was a limo that we got to get pictures taken in front of and they even pulled some strings and got a red carpet! Lol! Parents were dressed up as adoring ""fans"" and members of the ""media"". It was so cute! My dad and step mom made it down for the party, and that was a lot of fun too! A lot of people had never met my dad and it was funny to see everyones reaction! Saturday was fun too! I met up w/ Amy and she did my hair again.  Then came home and got dressed.  It was a lot of fun taking pictures all night w/ all my friends from high school! and I realized how much I missed some of my friends! My dad was the only person at the Cotillion who was dressed in his dress blues for the military! That was really cool too! While we were in line to be presented to the cotillion board my dad told me ""This is more nerve racking than jumping out of planes!"" I didn't think it was that bad, lol! Tim made it back in town from Ryans wedding just in time for dinner! After dinner they had a band playing. OMG, it was so much fun! We danced until prolly about 12 or so! And then we went out to Allison Peppers' house for the ""after party"".  I didn't go to bed until 3 or so! It was awesome! Sunday morning I woke Matt up so he could leave and then I went to church. I can't believe I actually made it to church! haha! After church my family went to eat with Mrs. Hildreth, Steven and Catherine. That was a lot of fun b/c Steven and I had never really talked before, but he's a really nice guy! Anyway, I excused myself from lunch early so I could make it to work by 2.  I worked from 2-6 and when I got home I was so exhausted I just went to sleep, even though my 2 little cousins were running around screaming! I woke up around 10:30 or so and Tyler and I went to get some dinner then went to bed at about 12:30 and didn't wake up until 12pm on Monday morning! Monday I went to the wellness center then came home and washed about 2 months worth of bugs dirt and mud of my car. Then Tyler, Monica, Leigh Anne, and I went to Chattanooga. I got about $220 worth of clothes for $108 at Gap! That was exciting! :-D Then we went to Victorias Secret to get some free panties, but Tyler ended up laying the bag down somewhere, so now someone had a lot of free underwear! haha! Next was dinner and then on to the movies! It was a lot of fun spending time w/ the girls! I can't wait until we go roller skating!!! lol! Oh yeah, today I voted! lol! First time voter! VERY exciting! haha! So thats all I got! BYE!!!"

I start working at Gap on Tuesday! I'm actually kinda excited! We'll see how long this lasts! Anyway, last night me, Chris, Caitlin, Matt, and two of Matt's friends went to Chattanooga to go see the fireworks! We ate at Mellow Mushroom, and after all the guys made me cry, we headed over to Coolage(sp) Park.  Well, the fireworks were horrible! Nothing can compare to Riverbend! Man, those fireworks were AWEOSME! But anyway, fireworks sucked, plus there was a tree in our view too! So after the fireworks we all just laid around for about an hour or so, then we headed back to Dalton. I dropped Chris off at home b/c he had to get up this morning for work at 8! I went home after I dropped him off and then got to talk to Alan on the phone! I sure do miss him! Dispite him being drunk, we have good convo! He and one of his friends from Ohio were down in Auburn, and I found out that he changed his number w/o telling me! Anyway, after I got off the phone w/ him Brad, Phillip, Tim and Whit all came over to my house...I had never met Phillip or Whit, but they made themselves right at home! LOL.

I went w/ Tyler and one of her friends from school. We had a TON of fun! Keith Urban is soooooo HOT!! and OMG...his accent! Geez! lol! Anyway, after the concert I was on my way home and Heath called me. We were supposed to go to a party for Cotillion (which is TONIGHT by the way). But he found out that I asked another friend before him, so he got angry and said he couldn't go b/c he doesn't like being ""2nd string or 3rd or 4th string for that matter"". I was sooo mad/upset/tired..So, I talked to Aaron, and he said that he would go with me. I'm considering asking someone else to escort me. I'm hoping it isn't too late to change my escort for Cotillion, b/c I really dont want to talk to him or see him for that matter! This didn't help the fact that I've felt kinda lonely the past couple weeks... I think my mom's really worried about me b/c i came in crying. Not only b/c I was upset b/c Heath was being a jerk, but just a bunch of things building up and that just topped it off!

I had an interview at Gap Outlet on Friday, and the bible study that was supposed to be at my house on Thursday never happened. No body came other than Drew and Rob(the guy giving the bible study!)  I was really mad that no one bothered to tell me ""No, I can't come tonight"" or ""No, I've got other plans"" Everyone was just like ""Yeah, I might come!"" or ""I'll probably come"". Oh well! Last night was the first night of Riverbend. I ended up going with my mom and Tim. It was a lot of fun! I got to see Summer for the first time this summer! i was excited about that! Ingram Hill started playing around 9, and they were awesome, they came to Auburn last semester, but I didnt' get to see them! But the lead singer is kinda hott! :) After they finished up, Michelle Branch played an all acoustic set which was awesome! She can really sing! So, despite being at Riverbend with my parents, and it being 93 degrees and a crazy amount of humidity, I had a lot of fun! I stayed up and finished a book that I've been reading for about a week now, and had good dreams the rest of the night! :) So, things are starting to get a little better!

got back to Dalton about 20 mins ago. This past weekend was a long one!
But I'll start with Thursday! Thursday was great! I picked my mom up
from work and took her to get a pedicure, she had never had one bofore!
It was a lot of fun just spending time alone with her! Thursday night
Tyler got home! I was so excited to see her! And she's actually home
for good this time!! YAY! Anyway, I went over to her house to just hang
out. We ended up starting a ""Wedding Journal"". We flipped through
wedding pictures and wrote down all our ideas that we had! Well, when
we finished up that, I realized that it was 2am, so Tyler said I could
just stay the night! So I left a message on my sisters phone telling
her to tell my mom that I'm at Tylers! Well, my mom called the Woodards
house at like 6:30 Friday morning looking for me! lol! Oh well! So,
Tyler and I woke up and dropped off my car to get the tires rotated,
oil change, new air filter and a new brake light! Then we came back to
my house so we could both change to go to the Wellness Center!! On the
way to the Wellness Center Star94 called out Cory's birthday for the
free money birthday giveavay, so I called him to get him to call, but
he still didn't win! It was really funny though! So we worked out for a
good hour and a half! I was on the eliptical for 35 mins! I was proud
of myself! We saw Alison Peppers there, and I found out that she's a DG
somewhere in Texas! I thought that was pretty cool! Anyway, Lauren
picked me up after we worked out and we hung out for a bit. That night
Heath came over and we hung out for a while, it was good to see Heath
b/c I haven't seen him much since I got home. Anyway, Saturday morning
I woke up and drove to Decatur AL for a family reunion on Sunday.
Saturday we picked up my grandmother's stuff that is being passed down
to my dad. It had beed at my great aunt's house since my grandmother
passed away, and since my great aunt passed away over spring break,
they can finally get all her stuff! It was really weired being there
and Aunt Jean not being there! Anyway! The famliy reunion...hmm...that
was interesting. They had it in their garage b/c they thought it was
going to rain. OMG, it was so hot! I was cool seeing all the old
pictures of my grandparends and my dad and his brothers and sisters!
Anyway, Sunday night we drove to Gadsden AL to stay at my aunt's house.
It was good to see my cousins. They didn't go to the reunion. They
still give me a hard time for going to Auburn since one graduated from
Bama last May, and the other is going to be a junior there this fall!
Oh well! Anyway, its Monday, and I'm home! I might go to Auburn this
weekend so if any of you are planning on being down there, give me
call! Well, I'm gonna head out to the Wellness Center! C-ya!"

We had a great time! But apparently...according to mothers of other girls in Cotillion..I would have had even more fun at Casino night!! So when I told her that I didn't go b/c I didn't have anyone to go with because the three ppl i asked already had plans she said ""well, you could have kept asking, oh wait, you dont even keep in touch with 5 people from your graduating class""  So, I'm here to apologize to everyone in my graduating class...if you feel that I dont keep in touch with you, I'm soo sorry! Please forgive me...I'll try and talk to you all a lot more now!! 


I WANNA GO BACK TO AUBURN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

And trouble's everywhere,
When skies turn dark above you
And joy turns to despair,
When everything just falls apart
And no one seems to care,
Just look deep down inside your heart,
And know, that God is there.

So, I ran across this quote from a friend's profile, and I really like it.  I think that so many of us completely forget about God when we get in times like these. I know I have a problem with trying to deal with my problems by myself. I don't give them to God until I've already made a COMPLETE mess out of things! Anyway, just thought this might encourage a few of you!! Tell me what ya think by posting a comment! and if you have any good quotes that you know, feel free to post them!!!

I got an awesome workout...so awesome that I can hardly walk! After that I went and got my hair trimmed FINALLY! Well, there was some drama for a while, but once I left the shop, I was fine! I went to Moe's and grabbed some lunch and then came back to the house and watched Passions and Dr. Phil! Then I went to church! It felt soo good to be back at Grace! I missed it! I'm really looking forward to youth this summer! We get ""buddies"". Greg is going to pair each of the college students up with a few of the youth members!

We finished packing things up and I had to go talk to my advisor.  I felt a lot better about my ""plan"" after I talked to her! I feel like I have direction now! lol! Well, we left Auburn at about 12ish.  We stopped my The Edge, the apartments I'm living at next year, so I could show my parents the apartment! They liked it! On our way home we stopped at the outlet mall in Calhoun. I got some things at Gap. Once I got home I just wanted to clean EVEYRTHING out of my room and then unpack. So I started pulling things out, and tossing things!  After that I was worn out. So I went to bed early.  I didn't even get my clothes inside last night! I was just soo exhausted!

I told him that we would bake it together! So I go over there and we just decided to cook dinner.  So we went to Krogers and picked up a few things. We watched the baseball game on TV and hung out.  Dinner was great! We had deer meat, green beans w/ potato slices and broccoli flavored noodles.  Alan came and joined us for dinner, but we werent going to tell him about the cake.  He almost made it out the door without figuring out that we had already baked the cake! Lol! He wasn't too happy that we werent going to share! Then Austin and I watched Shreck.  After that Alan and Clint and Ashley came over and we all watched the Last Samurai. I didn't think I was going to like it, but I did! and man, Tom...I must say that you're so hot even w/ long stringy hair! :) That was pretty much the end of my night! It was fun!

Then Melanie and I went to Campus Pointe and got some rays of golden sun by the pool. We were out there for a good 3 hours! So yeah, thats right, i'm a little pink! haha! no worries though! But after the pool we went to Wendys and got a frosty then to fill up on gas. After the stop for gas I took Melanie back to her place so we could both get showers and get ready for the baseball game. So then Mel and I went to the game...and the game was going kinda slow...so we left at 7th inning strech.  We were losing 3-1 at the time...and I still have no idea if we pulled it off or not! Oh well! We left to go get some food b/c I was STARVING!!! Went to Moes..man..i just can't get enough of that place...actually, we went b/c they take tigercard...and i remind you, i have $ 3.58 in my bank right now! :-D Then we both changed into our night attire and hit up Highlands! We got there before ten so we got in free...that was nice...but then we had to sit around until like 11:30 or so until US Band started playing! Shanna and Nicole came too! I was really excited!! We got some GREAT pictures for the apartment next year!! But anyway Mel and I ran into Catie, but her friend Lucion(loo-shun), previously called Lucifer, headed back to Southen Miss. but at least we figured out his name! The band was awesome! I got ignored by Alan again! But its cool! no worries! We hung out/danced with some pretty cool guys! One of them lives in Little (dorm across from mine), and I checked him in at my dorm so he could go get his friends. They were fun! So anyway! Melanie and I were really tired from being out in the sun, so we decided to leave after the first set! And here I am...telling you about my night! It was fun! I'm going to miss Auburn this summer! And I'm really gonna miss all my friends (sorry if that sounds like i'm graduating or something CHAR!!!) But anyway! I'm exhausted...and I might get up and go to the lake w/ Chris Rogers tomorrow!

After I got fed up w/ studying I decided it might be a good idea to balance my checkbook...well, its a good thing I did, b/c I now know that I have a grand total of $3.58 in the bank! I'm thinking about going to Taco Bell sometime and writting a check to see how low I can get it w/o going over! haha! Anyway! So after I balanced my check book, I went to take my chemistry final. I felt pretty good with it when I left! But who knows if thats a good sign or not!! Ha! After chem I went to eat w/ Nicole and Shanna at Moes! (WELCOME TO MOES!!) It was soo good! Then I went to pick Kayla up from Lukes.  I try to like that kid, but everytime I think he's finally figured out how to treat her, he goes and screws up again! So anyway, we go to Walmart and then to move everything out of her dorm into her car. Man! It was soooo hot! I was in jeans..and it was in the 90s today! or so i hear! ha!! Well, we got everything crammed just perfectly into her car! After that I took a quick shower and headed to the baseball game with Cowboy Matt and Harris! We played South Carolina and beat them! I got a little nervous in the 9th, b/c they started coming back on us! but we finished the game out! Anyway, I ran into Melanie at the game! and after I left, I was riding around and called Melanie and told her that I was kidnapping her! So after I kidnapped her we went to Coldstone to get ice cream!  We hung out and just chit-chatted..ya know...the normal girl talk! ;)  After that I had the great idea of going to the park! Hickory Dickory Park that is! haha! I love that place! It is the best park ever!!! We started off on the swings, and just ran around for a while! It was soooo much fun! We decided that it was the perfect place for a date w/ our boyfriends...but then we realized that we didn't have any! Haha! So we were gonna take a poll to see if we could find a guy that would just cuddle/hug/kiss under the stars...but that never happened (maybe next time Mel)! So after running around like 8 year olds, we just drove around some more listening to the fabulous Love CD! Anyone thats heard it can tell ya...its AWESOME! Haha!We drove to Highlands to see if anythign is going on this w/e, and US Band is there tomorrow night, and so somehow I have to find $7 to get in!! Then we drove past Mama G's and saw Alans truck. So we thought we'd say hey. But of course he didn't talk to me So we went in and hung out w/ the phi tau boys.  Then a girl that dropped my sorority was there! I started talking to her and she introduced us to her friend Lucifer...well...something along those lines! haha! He was pretty cool..until he started smoking! YUCK! Guys, FYI, smoking is a HUGE turn-off!!! but anyway! supposively he and catie grew up together and he was visiting her.  He offered to buy me a drink but of course I turned him down b/c i dont drink! Then me and mel started throwing ice across the room, at this point we decided that we were just reliving our childhood years! haha you know, the park, then the ice. yeah it was fun! Anyway!  Lucifer got a phone call and went outside, and we things started to die down so Melanie and I decided to leave after Freebird ended....thats such a good song! So when we walk outside we see Lucifer sitting on his friends car. Supposively something was going on w/ Catie and her friend....something about her talking to ALAN!?!?!? HAHA! that was funny! seeing how Alan didn't talk to me! ANYWAY! Totally DIFFERENT story! So we talked to Lucifer for a little bit longer, and he tells us that he thinks they are going to Highlands tomorrow night to see the US Band! Cool! So we told him that we may see him tomorrow and then left.  I then delievered Mel-B safely back to her dorm!!! See, not all kidnappings are bad! Mine are fun! :) Well, I'm gonna hit the sack! This is WAY long! haha! Night! sweetdreams!"

So I get up at 7:30, and just happen to flip through my journals and realize that I wrote about the same article twice.  So I had to quickly find another article to write about.  I ended up being about 5-10 mins late to class! Ha oh well!! Hopefully my paper looks good! And as for my chemistry test I had today at 9:30. Well, I think I did pretty well.  I mean I'm positive that I passed w/out any curve. Compared to last time when i passed only WITH the 18 point curve! Yup! Thats right! I got a 42 before the curve last time! No worries though! The year is almost over, and I cant wait for summer break.  But I'm going to really miss all my friends from Auburn!! You guys better keep in touch!! So anyway, after my test today, i took a shower and then slept from 11-4.  That was a fabulous nap! haha! But I did want to kill the boys upstairs who were being WAY too loud! I mean, they sing at the top of their lungs, but really, they can't sing at all!!! Then someone was tooten on some whistle..I thought I was gonna scream, but I didn't! I eventually fell back asleep!

Cal came and visited Auburn the week before our spring break and that was the first time I met him! Well, before the dance we went to Outback for dinner.  Cal asked me what I wanted and I wasn't sure, so he took my menu and told me what I wanted!  After we tweeked a few minor details (water instead of sweet tea) Cal placed my order for me!! Haha! Before our food came a man came by our table and made all of the girls balloon corsauges! It was great!! Then Zach, yet ANOTHER Oneontaian, got a balloon hat w/ an anchor on it!! It was so funny!!!  After dinner we loaded the buses and headed to the Olde Auburn Ale House!  The music in the begining was pretty good, but it got worse over time, then FINALLY the guy started playing our requests!! The dj was horrible, but we had a blast anyway!!!!  at about 11:15, Laura and her b/f were ready to go, and since i was driving, we had to go too!!  So we loaded the bus to go back to the parking lot and then dropped Laura and Adam off at their car.  Cal and I then changed and since Cal is a Sigma Chi, we were gonna go by their band party.  Well, whoever told us that there was a band party was wrong, b/c the place was EMPTY!! So we heard a band at Farmhouse, so we stopped by there.  Well, it was Cover Girls...and no one was there...and yeah...so we left! Then we continued and went to one of the gymnast's house where they had an end of the year party.  It was dying down b/c the cops had just left, but we stayed and chit-chated for a while and then decided to go to IHOP! Me, Cal, and Daniel sat at IHOP for about 2 hours.  Daniel and Cal were talking about the good ole Oneonta times! And I just laughed at all the stories.  After we left there we came back to the dorm and went to bed!!!

Anyway, my foot is feeling a little better, still a little swollen and sore but it doesn't hurt nearly as bad as it did Wednesday and Thursday!!  Thursday night I went home to Dalton and it was great to be home!! I really enjoyed being babyed since i was hurt!!! Friday morning I woke up at 4am crying b/c my foot hurt so bad, so I rolled over, picked up my cell phone and called my house phone and woke up my step dad (Tim) and my mom!! My mom then brought me some medicine up, but it didn't help b/c i continued to wake up every thirty mins after that!!!  So that wasn't a good night!!!  Friday I got up and hobbled around the house then made my way to my car and went to pick up Heath.  He was starving, poor thing was stuck at home by himself, w/ no car and no food in his house!!  So I picked him up and took him to get some breakfast then he helped me make it into American Eagle to apply for a summer job.  After that I took him to visit some old friends that he used to work w/ at DPRD. Then I went to eat lunch with my mom at her school! Its always soo funny to go b/c her kids are always like ""which one are you? Are you Lauren? Wait, you're the oldest?! You dont look the oldest!!"" Gee thanks kids!!! haha! Anyway, I then preceeded to take Heath to the grocery store and dropped him off at his house...That was the excitement of Friday! My mom and I cooked dinner at 9pm that night and didn't eat until 10! that was fun too! haha! Saturday rolls around...I wake up and I'm planning to leave to come back to Auburn at about 12 or so...well..nope..my mom made plans for me to drive 30 mins north of Dalton to Tim's mom's house so i can get a dress fixed. Well, then she tells me that I can't go up there until 3:30! so there goes my leaving at 12!!! So long story short I left at about 5 and made awesome timing!!! I made it in 2 hours and 20 mins!!! Then I went to the Phi Tau house for the last night of Margaritaville w/ Velcro Pygmies.  That was my first time seeing them! They were awesome! Melanie and I had a blast!!!  Those blowpops were good!! haha!! oh yeah, and check out their site (www.velcropygmies.com) and see if you can find any pics of us!!! Hehe!! After that i hung out for a bit and then went and picked up Cowboy Matt from Roosters!! We went and got some food from Taco Bell and just hung out and talked before going back to the dorm! This morning I had sisterhood retreat all morning! Lots of fun! Well, thats concludes my extra long w/e!!! I hope you all have a good week!!! TTYL!!!"

After that I skipped geography and came back to the room to take a shower. I had to be at tryouts at 11:30 for weigh-in and to draw a number.  I was so excited when I found out that I was stunting w/ Joel (aka Mic Man).  Anyway, so I started practicing my stunts w/ him, and well...NOTHING worked! I got so worked up and frustrated I just gave up! I was so ready to just walk out of there!! Well, once it was my turn to do stunts, I nailed ALL of them! I was so excited! and I also did my back handspring!  When it was time to do the dance...well...lets just say that the toe-touch back handspring didn't happen! haha! I landed the back handspring on my knees.  At that point I couldn't care less, so I just started laughing at myself! I finished the dance and was ready to get out of that place! Finally it was time for the cheer! I started Two Bits and nailed my toss extension.  When I popped off from the extension, I landed on my foot weird and  messed up my foot.  So I suffered through Badda Getta and then went to the trainer.  She iced it for a while and told me that i might have pulled the muscle that surrounds the joint on my big toe, but if it still hurts in a couple days, then I may have chipped or fractured the bone! Well, I've now taken a total of 6 yes, count them SIX Aleve....do you know what the limit is?!? THREE! haha! I'm sure I'll be taking more before I go to bed too! I'm planning on going to the medical clinic sometime in the morning!!  I'm soo glad that today is over!!!  It was WAY too stressful! haha!

I'm waiting for Lauren's boyfriend to call me and tell me if I'm going to need to give and interview to get a summer job at Athletes World in Dalton.  Since I'm not going to be taking classes, I need to do something with my time! Anyway, thats enough for now! Toodles!"

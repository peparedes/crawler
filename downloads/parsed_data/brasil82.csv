Oh yeah and as im writing this damn entry I am getting a booty invite over the damn aol IM....what the hell does that say about me....my self estemm is spiraling towards disaster again and i don't like it! 
In a conversation I had earlier in the day I contemplated the fact that maybe there is something wrong with me.....maybe Im defunct in the love department...unlike most veryone I know I have not been able to hold down a long term relationship...yes I was engaged but hell we barely made it a year and was complete bullshit through and through....Mica and I only lasted like 9 months (who incidentally tiold me today he doesn't like me hanging out with so many guy friends...like he has the damn right to interject)and those are the only two relationships I have been serious in....am I relationship handicapp? 

Im not sad about this whole occurence cause its been happening for years Im just confuesed...bewildered at the fact that here I sit with so much to offer and nothing to grab onto....or that I want to grab onto.....I think the problem is me...its something i need to work on within my self that no one else can fix, except for maybe god and we won't get into that

So the question I ask is...are there more handicapped women out there who just can't seem to get their love lives in order or am I just that one special women who is destined to have nothing but meaningles boy toys for the rest of her life....maybe I should change my name to Samantha Jones(Sex and the City)"

I try so hard to be 
the person I need to be
Nothing ever fits the 
mold that is held out there for me
Being my own kind is
a dangerous thing
I must be prepared 
for what this life brings
I must take a stand
and never be afraid
I must take the time to step
outside the box and relish
the life I have made

"event","I swear I will never understand people....or maybe I will just never understand myself. Sometimes I think my expectations are too high for people and maybe I should lower my demands some, but wait! no! why should I?! What is wrong with expecting people to be responsible in their lives, why shouldn't I expect to be treated with the same respect as everyone else?! 

I don't really like where my mood and personality have been lately, I sometimes feel like Im just so lost, so alone and no one is there to help me along. I know I shouldn't need help and that Im a strong person that can handle this on her own...hell I've been handling it since I was 17....but now Im just so tired. Im so tired doing it all on my own and taking care of everyone else....I want to be taken care of for CHRIST SAKES! I want someone there to hold my hand sometimes and look me in the face and say ""don't worry we'll get through this together"" or ""you can do it, i have faith in you!"" When the voice in my head says that stuff it just doesn't sound the same.

I realy don't know what is wrong with me....im seeing that im just like my mother...hell craziness runs in my family why would I think that it would skip me?! I feel like Im back in high school where Im soooo self concious, all the confidence I developed over the last 4 or 5 years seems to have been flushed down the toilet. I really think this whole Matthew situation over summer kinda tore me down and sent that wall i built crashing to the ground....damn I used to be a hard ass and now im just this broken rose wilting to the ground....okay maybe a tulip ois better for me than a rose. I have no confidence and now I met this guy.....a nerd actually, but a hot nerd.....and I have no idea what to do, we hung out on Thurs during my DJ shift and then had dinner Fri night and now Im sooooooooo intrigued. 

He plays D&D, and I think he does DDR and he likes sci fi....and they are all what make him who he is and think it's totally cool....maybe Im really a nerd at heart. But usually i would have no probelm going after what i want but now im scared.....i don't know if he's really interested at times it seems as if he his and then isn't...oh hell i can't spend time worrying about it....and damn i wrote a book...i'll finish this whole rant tomorrow my hair hurts!

Things come and things go
but the past comes back to haunt you
My life moves ahead of me
but my world stays the same
The person you saw once before has changed
but you are too blind to see that all 
I'm trying to do is be me
I know what I've done 
I know where I've been,
my eyes are open to world beneath me.
I have learned from my life and are trying to change
for the better

They speak their lines
They keep you hanging by a thread
You know it's not right
and he leaves your heart full of dread
but yet you keep on with your love
and send your emotions into flight
Then life rings true and you are left all alone
To drown in a misery you have never known"

"event","Yep it's that time again....I offically have Spring fever. I have no motivation to do anything at all. Luckily I knew i was going to go through this so I made sure to really get my grades up at the beginning of this semester. One of the first responsible things I have ever done...Yay me I'm groing up! Yet I still feel very stressed.....I'm too that point again where I'm just so tired of people. I've been on a string of horrible dates this past week and have realized that there is no possible way I can have a normal dating life here in Huntsville. I'm offically starting the penis embargo until I graduate...heheh let's see how long this lasts! So far I've been on this embargo for about 3 weeks now but have not made it offical until this moment. PLus I miss Mica but he basically shot that idea right out of the water for me a few weeks ago....but he's right we are going different ways, but it doesn't change the fact that I still love him. I think that's my problem....I compare everyone to him....I did this for 2 years after Keith and I broke up, I compared everyone to him until I met Mica. Damn I just run around in circles.....It's offical i do and will always have a disastrous love life....I think it might be genetic, if only you knew my family....Divorce is a tradition!

Well i have to run my math class is calling me and I get to go see how bad a failes this last test....1st one this semster...go me! I'm thinking I made a 32! I'm gonna laugh my ass off if it's any lower!"

"event","So tis the season to get married! Went to a wedding Sat night and it's so strange to see someone you know who is even younger than I getting married. I sat there at the reception by myself watching all these people dancing (I didn't not bring a date of course!) and wondered why I've never danced with anyone I've been with like that. And I realized with the exception of my relationship with Mica I have never allowed anyone to pursue me past the first few weeks. I tend to cut myself off because of this fear I have of being vulnerable. I never want to allow myself to be on the chopping block for someone to cut me in half. I want to change this about myself but I'm not quite sure how to go about it. I just get so scared sometimes ......I know I sound stupid but these feelings are really there. And I'm probably not really going about it as eloquently as I should but this I how I get it out. 

Mica told me last night that he sees that I have changed and that it's not necessarily  for the worse but that I'm going in a totally different direction than he is. I suppose he's right, he is 7 years older and has experienced more life than I and now it's my turn to go through these things but it kinda sucks that I have to do it with out him. 

Okay I have class in like 20 mins so I gotta run! I promise I'll pull myself out of the rut in the next few days so just bear with me till then."

I've been trying my hand a writing poems again......they are often retarded and sappy but hey they help me to get rid of some of the thoughts in my head that I would not normally talk to anyone about so here are a few.....they are all untitled and they kinda run together so DON'T LAUGH!!!!

Here I go again 
I'm here alone and on my own
I went against my fears
and now all I have are tears
I put my trust in the hands of another 
and threw all other ideas out the window
Bsut that didn't last 
and now I've been cast aside
So here I go again on my own
___________________________________________________

They walk in
They walk out
and alwyas leave me with doubts
I stand here hiding my fear
wondering when I can come down from there

___________________________________________________________

As always here I stand
Yet again lost in my own fears
Struggling to see through this fog that covers me
Frozen in my mind and scared to step through the box
Nothing will suffice
Nothing will satisfy me
I look towards the sky
and I reach for the clouds
When I arrive in the sky
my heart wants nothing more
than to sink back to the ground

I'm sure everyone is sensing a pattern....I swear I'm not depressed or bipolar or manic...or any other crazy things you can think of, but this is (as with others) is a time in my life where I'm constantly searching for who I really am.....I often find my self struggling between two identies and I'm not quite sure which is really me. I'm trying to improve myself where I can combine both and be happy with the outcome but for right now I'm content with my mind in Limbo.......I believe we all must go through at some time or another. As always please comment on my great pieces of literature! I'm on my way to be the next Shakesphere....hehehe ;)"

That's kinda how I felt last night....while out celebrating (even though I'm sick) the super bowl with friends I suddenly felt the need to pull away from the group and watch everything around me then I went to bathroom to look at myself and really didn't recognize the person in the mirror. It was like I was looking at someone else's reflection. It was quite unnerving. I finally snapped out of the whole mood I was in but it still bothers me.

So I start my new job at Zack's tomorrow...I'm a little nervous that I won't do a good job. I mean I'm usually good at what I do when I out my mind to it but I'm just a little nervous I guess. But at least it's at the front of my street and not 30 mins away like that stupid job at The Woodbine Hotel!

Black Heart
Dry Eyes

Why must we play all these stupid games
While we sit and watch our lives go up in flames
You've run away towards a hell you can't see
And left me to swim in this sea of misery

Why can't you see
Why can't you be
The man you used to be
Why can't you see
Why can't you be
The man I needed you to be

All these things you say
All the things that you do
Make me realize how much I hate you
You keep me at arms length
And I keep pushing myself to reach
To reach for your comfort 
To reach for your love

Why can't you see
Why can't you be
The man you used to be 
Why can't you see
Why can't you be
The man I longed for you to be

I'm very busy and it's hard to get ahold of me sometimes so this is the best way possible....I think! I'm gonna send this link to my mother so I'm gonna try and keep it at least PG-13....hehehe yeah right since when have I ever done things the way people expect me. It's all about shock value right people! 

So bascially here what's going on.....I have changed my major for the 5th time to Radio broadcasting/Journalism and no matter how much I hate it(I don't at the moment) I'm sticking to it! It's time to face the fear of commitment and this is the best way to start...a career! Can't you just imagine me as a hard nosed journalist trying to dig deeper into the realm of people's lives!

I have been working at a small reasturant 30 min north of here in Madisonville but was lucky enough to find a job right in front of my aprtment called Zack's....yay no more long ass boring drive through the back country of Texas. I now know all different breeds of cows!

Two more years of school left and then I'm thinking maybe I'll move out to Cali....loved it when I was there and the weather sure beats this damn Houston crap. But I'd have to make sure I didn't go out searching for Keith....he's the only thing stopping me from going out there.

It's just one of those days that really hits me that Meghan isn't here anymore and she never will be. It's a reminder to me that I will alwyas be living a life for 2 people and not one. Someone told me the other night that I'm scared to make decisions and he's right. I'm afraid of disappointing not my parents but my sister's memory. I know I haven't done a good job of living a productive life the past 2 years but I want to make a change. Getting back into school is my number one priority right now. I don't quite know how but I want to do it. Then I'll feel like I have some kind of direction in my life. Hopefully I'll have an answer on finacial aid by summer and maybe I can start night classes in the summer. I mean hell I only have 2 more years to go, all my basics are out of the way I just have figure out what it is that I want to do with my life. Everyone keeps telling me music is my path and that I shouldn't waste my talent and yet I  know they are right but that life is so unstable and I feel I need stability in my life to survive. Oh well hopefully I'll figure it out. Oh and ""you"" maybe your right about stopping what we've been doing it's not healthy, I'm actually admitting that your right so you might want to save this.

There has always been something but with this guy it's just not there. I'm 2 months older than he is yet I feel years older. Patrick is younger than this guy and he acts more and lives more like an adult. There just comes a time when we have to grow up. I guess we all just do it at different times."

It was fun, wierd but fun. There was a tad bit of drama but nothing I couldn't handle. I was suppossed to have a meeting with the youth minister at my mom's church about my problem's with church and religion...apparently he wants to know ""my story""....but I canceled on him cause I really didn't want to get into it with him. He came of as a complete ass, just pushing and pushing for me to meet with him and to automatically believe in the church and what not and, dude let me tell that is so not the way to go about it with me. I'd rather talk with someone I know and that I'm comfortable with, and I think I know just the right person. 

I GOT GLASS FOR MY CAR! Yay1 Kinda sad that excites me but hey it's little things that count right?

"event","I can't believe what just happened....someone just sent me all of these anoamyous(spell?) e-mails that were sent between 2 people who were friends of mine and they were basically centered around me. One of these people I thought was a good friend. I don't know who sent them or why but it hurt reading what I read. Saying thing like I have no substance, or no intellectual capacity. Reading all of this has made me question every friendship I have. How do I trust these people. I don't know if these convos were real or just sent to me to make me feel like shit but it makes me question the subsatnce of my friendships. I'm sorry if I seem as if I'm some kind of party girl and all I give a shit about is sex and partying and drinking. I am just like evryone else I have problems,I have thoughts and fears and feelings but I don't delve into them with everyone. I'm sorry but I just thought there was nothing wrong with having a good time. Why bring evryone else down with having deep intellectual conversations that can be saved for the right time and place. Fine if no one thinks I'm smart or worth anything, at least I know that I am. 

This just all goes back to the trust issue, this proves my whole theory on not giving your trust to someone until they prove it. Someone told me last night that if you expect the worst from people then you won't ever be let down, I thought he was crazy but now I see he's right.

I just can't let this get to me. I can't let these people bring me down. I know I have a lot to offer and someday some people will see it. I just hope those e-mails weren't real. I don't know though."

I had a really great and unveiling convo with someone last night. I think it opened alot of doors for me and made me understand things a little better. If your reading this, I told you not to but I know you are, Thanks for the goood conversation, too bad wouldn't couldn't have done it sooner.

So my stupid ex Jody called me today, I just pretended to be my ""sister"", he's so retarded he knows my sis died along time ago. He left a message for me saying I should stop avoiding his calls. Okay first off what calls? and second why the hell do I want to talk to him anyways. I will never ever understand what makes the male mind work and they say we are a complete mystery.

So I have a full day work tomorrow and I porobably won't get any sleep tonight either but Ihave to go tomorrow, *sigh*"

"event","So life's pretty damn boring right now, I look forward to work so because I actually have something to do. Hopefully this weekend will be pretty busy. Like I said before racing with Joe on Fri and Superna show on Sat. but I work all freakin day tomorrow and Sat. but I don't mind I'm making money and that is what matters. I've got to go to my dad's on sun. but I just fear he'll launch into another lecture, I know he's just trying to help but I hear the same thing from everyone it just gets a little tiring, but they are just doing it cause they care, so I know I should just chalk it up and listen and maybe something will sink, hopefully. Oh yeah and to whoever is leaving the psycho message, I would go into the Pat situation but I promised him I wouldn't discuss things about him on here and I respect that and I'm gonna stay true to that, so if you don't get it or don't understand it's just too bad. Well going to bed gotta be up at 7."

"event","Well it's been awhile for me.....I just got kinda caught up in things that were going on and being my melodramatic self. After Mike I broke up I ran into Patrick and for some reason or another we decided to get back together. It was comfortable for us at the time so it seemed right. We were wrong. After about a week he reverted bak to old Patrick which is fine but it just wasn't what I wanted and he wasn't happy either so after 2 weeks we parted ways for the third and final time. I'm really bad about hooking up with old boyfriends and I think it's because there is a history there. I was very proud of myself with the way I handled it. I was calm and I stood up for myself and told him he made me feel not good enough(and I know I am) and I didn't feel respected. I wasn't sad or upset or crying like I did the last time we broke up. I guess this time I just know that it's okay to be single and there will be anoher ""Patrick"" along, it'll come I know it. 

Working at Foleys for teh Christmas season it's hectic but it's only for a month and then I start training for the dispatcher position at Harris County...Yay 12.75 an hour, my own apartment is getting closer and closer. 

Mike and I are not on good terms right now. I think he might be seeing someone else but of course he wouldn't tell me and it's really none of my business, is it? It's wierd between us. I don't know what's going on or where it'll go but a friendship is seeming harder and harder to come by with him. Catie and I fixed our shit, we were both being dramatic and stupid so please refrain from judging my entries that are all basically yelling at her. 

If anyone is interested Superna will be playing at Fitzgerelds on Sat. night I'll be there hanging out with Catie. So some of ya'll should head out there and hear them they are awesome. Going street racing with Joe Fri. night. Went last weekend had fun but poor Joe is feeling all down and depressed so I'm gonna try and khelp him through his hard time by being a good friend. Well gotta run I'll update more later on."

Catie I'm sorry if you feel like I have used you or taken advantage of your friendship but that couldn't be farther from the truth. I have explained myself plenty of times to you today and now I'm just going to give you your space and whenever you feel like working things out with me(if you ever do) then I will be right here ready to fix this problem. My probelms with Neil however are a little different and they go deeper then this weekend and before I try to talk to him about it I need to collect my thoughts and figure out what exactly it is that is bothering me. But again that journal entry was not about you at all and I'm sorry i wasn't clearer, this probably doesn't help much but I tend to push siuation too far..so...fuck it..I'm just gonna shut up...whenever your ready, I'm ready"

Why do people hurt others for pleasure?
Why don't people understand that loyalty is an important life long lesson?
Why do people bring others down only to make themsleves feel better?
Why are people so vindictive and vengeful?
Why do FRIENDS drop other FRIENDS when they need them?
Why do people do all of these things and more I will never understand. My friends have always been the most important people to me and I have tried to never let them down but it nevr seems to be enough does it. I try to tell them about my problems and they seem bothered by it, and yet I'm right there to help them and give them advice whenever they need it. I have alwys tied my hardest to be a good friend and a good person and yet I am still run over. I never wanted to turn into one of those cynical people who shuts every friend out of her life but it's looking like that's the way it's gonna go. I can't trust these people with anything let alone my heart.

"event","Trust is most definetly a word I have not put much faith in...just as I have not put much faith in people who come in and out of my life. This weekend was a time I needed people in my life to be there for me, a time when I needed to have that faith in my friends and surprise surprise out of all my friends you know who was the only person standing by my side....Mike. I've only known him for three months and stood there and held my hand through the whole situation, all of my other friends just fucking flaked out on me or helped only when it was convienent for them. And then when Ineeded a place to stay my best friend Cambria was right there last night...not making me feel uncomfortable or guilty for staying there she just willingly let me in and acted like the best friend I know she is. 

Now there is a certain person who has been in my life for 4 years now whom I considered one of my best friends who showed his true colors this weekend. He proved to me that he only cares about himself and not helping a friend in need who would have gladly helped him out of any situation if he needed it. Well that friendship is over, I have no room in my life for a friendship that is one sided. If I am going to be your friend than you get all of me...all of my loyalty and all of my trust, he has run me over too many times and insulted and hurt me too many times. I knew from the beginning if he entered a certain situation that I would no longer be of interest to him. He promised and swore that my friendship would still mean everything to him and he would still treat me the same. Well he lied and I have to say I'm not surprised but again I went against my first instinct and trusted him. Now he has something that is more important to him and I hope it makes him happy and I hope he's happy he drove a good friend away, I hope you satisfied with yourself. You finally did it...I'm out of your life for good. I can't bring myself to forget the way you treated me this weekend and you broke my trust and faith...Goodbye.

Now I have to decide where my parents lie in this situation of trust and faith. I love my mother more than anything in the world and would give my life for her...but I can't sem to be good enough for her. I know I make mistakes but kicking me out evry three months just gets a little too ridiculus if you ask me and I'm just tired of it all. I don't think I'm going back. I haven't been home for a week and it's not looking like I'll be back anytime this week. My step dad wants to take me to lunch today so we will see what happens, I'm am totally dreading this but it's free fod and I ought to see what he has to say. I'll update you when I get back."

Then Mike and I are meeting Cam and Terry at Terry's house to head to Ren Fest...can't wait! I had so much fun last year....I think Mike is gonna dress up....he of course is the only brave one out of all of us to do it. Maybe I'll get hit on by another knight in shining armour again?! 
Then I have a date Sat. night but I don't think I'm gonna go, the dude is kinda annoying but I said I would go...oh who knows. Maybe I'll go clubbin' with Joe and Chris...haven't hung out with those crazy fucks in awhile! Sunday I think is my day of relaxing...and then counting down the days to the Superna party....STEVE you and I are gonna party our asses off that night! God I can't wait! 

So I dropped the news to Catie and Neil and Steve that I was bi-sexual...they said they pretty much had figured that out, though they were happy to know that I totally prefer Men over women, i think it's just a phase cause i don't see myself in a relationship with a women , i think it's just cause I'm at that age where I just want to experience everything.

Ever heard of the terrible twos....OMG I thought I was going to lose my mind! I love him to death but after hearing him scream for three hours straight and having his diaper fly past my head I went nutz!

Got a computer from my Grandma....now I have my own comp and can download porn anytime I want! YAY! It's kinda slow but it's better than nothin'....I am very grateful. 

Talked to Mike tonight....I know that I need to be with him...but it just can't happen right now....he's sweet to me but I need to be on my own so I know that I can do it! I know I can. He says he'll wait...and tht's good but what happens if he waits and I meet someone else? I guess we'll cross that road when it gets there. Well I am so tired so I'm gonna play on here a little while and go to bed."

"event","I swear having friends fucking SUCKS!I am so sick and tired of having to justify myself and my life to Neil. He says he's mad at me and hasn't been calling me because he's mad that I decided against having a relationship with Mike . Big FUCKING deal it's my god damn life I can live it the way I fucking want to. 

Neil if you read this maybe you should stop worrying so much about my life and take a fucking look at yours. Oh wait I forgot your to scared to. Holly might beat you up. You've got bigger problems to deal with then my life. Hmmmm...let's see no job, never going to class, oh yeah and living with a controlling psychotic ex-girlfriend who tries to run your life...Wait...you let her run your fucking life!

I'm so angey right now I want to fucking hit something. Your my best friend and I would EXPECT some kind of understanding from you. You complain that Catie and I are your only fucking friends. You keep doing this to me your gonna push me away for good. NEVER EVER Tell me how to run my life! Keith did that, my mother does that I don't need that from my fucking friends...especially you!  Get over it and realize your never gonna ge able to control what I do. 

Oh! And if I say that I'm going to do something and then don't do it...BIG DEAL! If it doesn't pertain to you then who the fuck cares! When I was telling you that I wanted to be in a relationship with Mike I was trying to convince myself that I could commit to him, I was trying to do the right thing! But I couldn't do it, and you of all people should know why! 

DON'T YOU EVER JUDGE ME...EVER!"

I'm not that irresponsible....and this incident has caused every one here to just give me looks! I hate it cause everyone thinks I'm some party frek who went out and got drunk last night and that's why I was late! It's not...and when I tell them I stayed home and answered the door for trick or treaters and that I was in bed by 10:00 they just roll their eyes and say ""of course you were!"" BAH! I hate that. And I'm really uoset with myself b/c Mr. Larry my boss is such a kind man and I didn't want to disappoint him in any way. 

I was so tired last night.....don't know why...I've been doing this whole insomnia thing. I will be asleep by 10:30 but I'll wake up at 2 drenched in sweat and not able to go back to sleep. Not sure what's going on there....hmmm."

"event","Last night was great...I got everything worked out with Mike. I won't go into any details but I will tell ya'll this much, I am still single today...BUT Im a very happy girl too. Let's see if ya'll can figure it out.

You know I could have a great relationship with Mike and I were to settle down it would most definetly be with him, but I just can't do that right now. Being in a relationship and staying commited to someone is just too hard. I really don't think I could be faithful to anyone just right now. Hopefuly my whole outlook will change in a few months, few years, who knows! 

I'm glad I still have Mike in my life, I can't bear the thought of losing him. I'm just glad that I was able to be honest with him about my feelings without feeling judge or having to justify myself. Lets' all give a round of applause to Mike

"event","SO here I am at work bored as usual....well this whole Mike situation is back in forth with me. I really like and I really care about him but the thing is I think he wants to be way more serious than I do and whenever that happens I start to freak and I back off, I can't do that this time. He is giving me a second chance...I never gave him a chance in the first place. But I just want to date and see what I want to do from there, that's just how I work that's how I asess the situation. If a month from now after we've dated a few times I want to continue and go farther then great but maybe it won't be that way. I just won't now and I don't want to jump into anything right away when I'm not even sure myself. I can tell I'm not sure b/c I keep questioning myself and that's not a good sign. Well we will see what happens. I'm headed down there to night just to hang out and then it's off to a haunted house tomorrow then we have another date planned for next fri., and that's good it's enough tme apart that I don't feel like we are getting too serious but it's enough time together so that he doesn't see that I'm pulling away."

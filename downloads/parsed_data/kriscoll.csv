It just wasn't working out anymore.&nbsp; I apologize, but it's time for me to be moving on. 

I just found something better than you, and although you were great to me, this one is better.

Sincerely,
Kristen.

"event","debating being a crowd follower and getting a new blog livejournal thing.&nbsp; i just feel so lonely since i think all of my friends have switched to other ones.&nbsp; not to mention my layout is kind of old and irritating and im way too lazy to do anything about it.

ive made some good $$$ in the past few weeks, it makes me very excited.&nbsp; I went on a little shopping excursion yesterday, spent like just over $150 and got a bunch of cute things:
2 pairs of jeans
2 tank tops
6 shirts i think?

it was a great day of bargain sale shopping

now i just have to get my mom to go with me to get my school supplies and coax her into buying me some moooore stuff :-) tehehe

im so spoiled!

really excited because i have next friday night and all day saturday off, pretty awesome.
but i work.. monday night, double tuesday, wednesday morning, thursday night, friday morning.

I need to do laundry and dishes, annnd i need to shower and get ready for the day since me and brett are supposed to be hanging out for awhile.

i slept in so hardcore today, i almost got up at 9 and then i was like screw that day off im sleeeeeppiing in, brett didnt go to sleep until 530 so i figured it was okay :-)"

Lindsey came over today to see the apartment, chilled for like 3 hours just talking and taking a few pictures.&nbsp; it was so nice, i miss that girl more than i can say... it was really refreshing in a way to see her because i havent been able to see her as much and at the other apartment it was so hard to see her because of how far we were from each other...&nbsp;&nbsp; 
it's weird how distance impacts friendships;&nbsp; I've missed my best friend TERRIBLY!

Aurora gets custody of Ayden on Friday if everything goes as planned.. (Ayden is my godson/nephew.. not by blood, but ill go with what she says)&nbsp; which makes me extremely excited for her!!&nbsp; he is so adorable and she has been doing everything in her power to get this amazing little boy back in her life and im so excited its finally happening.&nbsp; I am so proud of her&lt;3

My other friend Jenny's boyfriend was in the hospital for nearly a month.&nbsp; He was in a severe motor cycle accident and lost like 6 inches of his small intestine or something like that and they induced a medical coma for 3 weeks so his body could heal itself.&nbsp; I felt so bad, he finally just woke up and is finally home again and she gets to stay with him and his family to help them take care of him.&nbsp; Thank god he is safe, that is going to be her future husband sometime.&nbsp; He's a good man from what i know and treats her with the utmost respect and i think he is perfect for her.&nbsp; I totally approve.

After watching the sopranos (working on the 4th season) i seriously wonder what it is like to be in the mafia or be married to someone in the mafia.&nbsp; must be an interesting life.&nbsp; 

I've been working alot lately, lots of hours is good though.&nbsp; I just had to replace my cell phone because the back of my phone broke and keeps sliding off and the connection is really bad and sometimes people can't hear me when i call, super annoying.&nbsp; so i got a nokia 5310 i think is what its called, its like a music player and its black and purple, really cute.&nbsp; Should be in sometime next week i hope!

I'm really excited for my classes to start at USM... I am so ready for a new start its not even funny :-P&nbsp; I think my classes are going to be awesome and i met most of my professors at orientation and they were all very coool.&nbsp; Im thinking about possibly adding a minor to my degree but im not sure, and im also contemplating trying to find a way to incorporate international business into my marketing degree.&nbsp; Its goign to be a great year though, none of my classes start before one but i have a late night class thursday..&nbsp;&nbsp; No classes friday-sunday though :-D PSYCHED!!!

It makes me sad how people change.&nbsp; I miss a lot of old friends and feel like i have lost a lot of contact with people who were important to me.&nbsp; I also am starting to see how college has changed a lot of my friends and how we have all kind of taken on our different paths.&nbsp; Some people i cant help but feel are just being ridiculous, but who i am to judge?&nbsp; Whatever makes people happy in the long run.

(i feel sorry for those people who feel the need to be fake and disregard others who previously cared for you....&nbsp; pushing people away is so not the way to go especially if it means getting closer to assholes who will fuck you over in the end)

I still need to lose weight.&nbsp; im terrible.&nbsp; But i can pay $5 to ge ta key to a fitness room and go there whenever i want as often as i want (its part of the foxcroft deals)&nbsp; and im totally considering it.&nbsp; Fuck driving 15-20 minutes to planet fitness and paying $20 a month when i can pay a one time fee of $5 and use everything as often i want.&nbsp; Such a much better plan in my opinion.&nbsp; Not to mention it saves gas.. +++++!!!

I'm almost finished the second novel in the chronicles of narnia... ie the lion the witch and the wardrobe.&nbsp; only a few more chapters left!! ..&nbsp; soon it will be 2 down, 5 to go.. lol.&nbsp; Its goign to take me forever to finish.

I have so much to say since ive been so MIA without the internet for over a week.&nbsp; its weird, i never have this much to say.. I htink i miss typing too and nobody is on for me to talk to.

another thing along that subject,&nbsp; i dont really talk to anyone online anymore anyways, no one cares to carry a conversation with me or i care to carry a conversation with me.&nbsp; although, ill usually talk to anyone if im around, im usually bored if im on the computer.. or avoiding school work, provided its during the semester.


I dont when i feel that people are ignoring me.&nbsp; that severly pisses me off.
I've been overly moody lately, i think i need to change my birth control to be honest.&nbsp; stupid hormones, i hate being a girl sometimes

I decided i need to work on the whole looking sexy and looking cute thing.&nbsp; I need to be more confident in myself.&nbsp; I over dramatize things and poison my mind to think things about myself that are totally not true or are just over-exaggerated.&nbsp; im not fat, but im not skinny.&nbsp; I could lose weight, but im not terrible at the size i am, although its nothing id want to flaunt.&nbsp; My butt is huge, but id rather have curves than be a board!&nbsp; my thighs are icky, but i could be worse.&nbsp; Its good that i can point out my flaws, but i shouldnt dwell on them because there are worse things in life and i can do things to improve them.

I mss alot of people.&nbsp;&nbsp; well, not necessarily, i miss what people used to be, not really who they are now.&nbsp; its sad how some people have such negative changes :-("

1. I worked a double, so exhausted.
2. We now have to move out of our apartment by Saturday.
3. Which means I'm going to be living back with my parents for a short while until we can figure something else out probably, me and Foxy. 
4. Dave is tomorrow and Wednesday, but I'm worried that because of everything that will be on my mind, I won't even be able to enjoy it.
5. We have to return a shit load of bottles &amp;&amp; cans
6. I finally just organized my closet and made it look awesome.. :-( and now I have to pack it allll up
7. I Have to Pack :-( :-( :-( :-( 
8. Foxy is now at my parents house, probably until we find a new place.. she has spent her laaast night at the apartment basically. sad :-(
9. There is a lot of fucking shit to pack and I am SO ridiculously unthrilled.
10. UHAUL I guess is going to be coming Thursday, if everything goes to plan.
11. I feel stressed and caught off guard. 
12. I hope things work out, though I'm pretty sure they will.&nbsp; Everything always seems to work itself out for the best in the end... even though that means having to find a new place to live.&nbsp; which saddens me, I've finally grown comfortable and accustomed to this area.. :-(&nbsp; boo!!"

I am so irritated.

I can not function.

I will be happy/lucky if i make it through the night without smashing a beer bottle and stabbing someone with it.

seriously.

I have anger management issues i think but i cant take classes because i have no moneyz lol.

I dont feel good.
I hate company when i dont feel good.
I went to my moms house tonight to see her and like chill with her even though i was sick ( i went in pajamas) and come home to guys playing beer pong instead of a movie night with brett which is what i thought we had planned on doing since i havent seen him all day.

boys do not understand the need of movie/cuddle nights when you do not feel good.


WHAT THE HELL MAN.

if the cat gets down here one more time
im going to open the door and let it go outside.

BYE BYE MR. KITTY LOL 

I am a terribly mean person.

Im not normally like this, but my buttons got severely pressed.

I think im going to go make them all feel like terrible people.
because to me, right now, they are terrible people.

Like today, i was driving and you know how people going straight on a green light have the right away over people turning left (if its not a protected left turn)?&nbsp; well this guy starts to go and turn in front of me, we both break, and he swerves his truck back into his lane and so i go and he gives me this ""what the fuck, learn to fucking drive lady"" look

and im just sitting there thinking

GO BACK TO FUCKING DRIVING SCHOOL YOU ASSHOLE, STRAIGHT HAS THE RIGHT AWAY ON A GREEN LIGHT, NOT A FUCKING LEFT TURN YOU DIPSHIT.


i feel remotely better now after getting that off my chest.

"event","&nbsp;So, i want to get a tattoo.

But i dont know what or where so this is where you come in.

My options for tattoos are:
Baby tiger
Shooting Star
2 blue birds flying up my left shoulder
Butterfly (one im looking at currently is all black.. like a tribal butterfly i guess is what you could call it?) for my right shoulder or ankle area because its quite simple.
Tiger Butterfly (instead of the tiger or butterfly tattoo, just combining them)
Possibly dolphin?

Places that I'm considering getting it are:
shoulder area (left&nbsp; shoulder is most likely going to be the 2 blue birds)
corners of my lower back
Ankle/leg-ish area.
possibly hip if it is small (like the black tribal butterfly)
POSSIBLY back of my neck


Any suggestions or opinions?&nbsp; Any input would be GREAT"

3) i have 20k+ out in loans
4) i think working would be the best option for me at this time.

I miss cancun because it was so carefree there and I miss carefree times.
I miss perricos
the pool bar
being drunk at 1
ordering drinks legally
getting drunk again at night time
kind of miss the speedy fast buses and the crazy taxi drivers
the view from our balcony
""mama drunk""
wave runners
xel-ha
swimming with dolphins
snorkeling and seeing all kinds of cool colored fish/reefs
brett's family+amy
the warm, blue ocean water
the penis/boob shaped pool.

Finally got together
Spent nearly every day together
Had our first sleepoverr
First everything
Got an apartment in october
Got our very own puppy Mid-November
Have our own little family.. Brett, Foxy, and I&nbsp; 
Celebrated our first thanksgiving together with both of our families
Celebrated our first christmas together with both of our families
Spent new years together
I got to take my first trip out of the country with him and his family
^^Our first trip together

and so so so much more.&nbsp; Life could not be much more perfect.&nbsp; He is amazing and i love him so much&lt;3 :-)

I'm kind of sick, bad cough, sore throat, mucus like lining my throat ( i know, it sounds nasty and it is pretty nasty ).&nbsp; 
It's Christmas eve.. Well, i suppose thats actually not true for another 12 hours or so, being its only 630 in the morning.
I finished my christmas shopping last night with Brett which was nice so i wont have to venture out into monsterous crowds later today.&nbsp; I also finished wrapping all the presents i got for everybody which is a relief.&nbsp; Then again, i don't really care because I love wrapping christmas Presents.&nbsp; As funny as it sounds, its probably my most favorite part of christmas lol :-p

Oh wait, I lied.&nbsp; Theres a pots and pans set in my car for my mom that i havent been able to wrap yet because i need brett to get it out of my car for me. hahaha wooooops... O:-) 

We got foxy some cute stuff, i wonder if she will try to open it herself.&nbsp; Regardless, I wrapped it anyways because i wanted to and it seemed like a good thing to do at the time.&nbsp; 

She gave us quite a scare the other night.&nbsp; Drew had some people over and somehow we figure she must have got into a cigarette carton (which we figured out the day after) and ate them. One of Drew's friends told us she was limping and everything.&nbsp; She was really hot, vomitting, shaking, and could barely walk.&nbsp; We had to take her to the emergency animal hospital (which thankfully is about 5 minutes from our place) at like 100 in the morning.&nbsp; We got back around 200-230 with the task of having to give her a syringe full of activated charcoal to help calm her stomach.&nbsp; they told us if she had any poisons in her system this would make her vomit and if she didn't, it wouldnt really do a whole lot.&nbsp; She DID NOT LIKE that stuff at all.&nbsp; it took us about an hour just to give her that stuff.

Anyways, I'm happy to report she is back to her normal self again.

Well im finally starting to feel tired again although i do feel alot crappier than i did when i first woke up...
WEIRD.

back to sleep for me i'd say

Everyone in my life is so incredible and amazing and i love them all.&nbsp; This is going to be the best christmas yet. 

I'm so insanely lucky and fortunate in everything i have today and all the wonderful people around me.

My parents have been awesome lately and although i miss them a little bit, its nice being out on my own.&nbsp; and they've come to terms with that.&nbsp; I actually think in some aspects i have better relationships with them because i dont really have the opportunity to get mad at them.&nbsp; not to mention the things id get in trouble over (chores) i dont do anymore sinc ei dont live their so there are no issues! (haha my poor poor brother.. i almost feel bad ;-) haha im rotten!)

Brett is amazing.&nbsp; I have the greatest boyfriend in the entire world and i love himso much... and the best part is he loves me too!! and there is no better feeling in the world than loving and being loved in return.&nbsp; (i feel like im quoting a line from moulin rouge but fuck it, im happy right now and it works!)&nbsp; his family is amazing.&nbsp; Im going to cancun with them and i can't even begin to describe how excited i am.&nbsp; I have been so welcomed into their family it is insane.&nbsp; I love how accepting and friendly they are.. that doesn't always happen!!! its great :-)

I love my friends.&nbsp; For awhile i felt like there wasnt any one around and no one really took the time to hang out with me but its changing now and people are back from college hwich make sme extrmely excited.&nbsp; Im not bogged down with school at the moment and since im taking 4 classes next semester and only 3 days of classes (Plus one online class) i have alot more time to work so i can make more money and work on paying off some of my loans and debt between car and student loans which will be extremely nice.

"event","So.&nbsp; I just got a membership to Planet Fitness as a early christmas present from my parents.. but they aren't paying me back until christmas.&nbsp; Its all good though, its billing reasons so im okay with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as I dont run out of money shopping for christmas :-O!


So anyone who wants to go to planet fitness with me... SWEEET. youll get to go for free.. ;-)&nbsp; hooray!

I've done my part for getting everything in to SMCC for now, and done everything on my part to be withdrawn from UNE.

Now, It's just a matter of waiting for everything else to get in, like my college transcript, my high school transcript, my fafsa, my financial aid cancellation information for UNE for next semester, and everything else.

I'm excited, I really hope SMCC works out.

I saw this ad for a country cd, like ""the big heart of country"" and feel sad to say i knew all but 1 song they played, and i still recognized that song.&nbsp; I feel like a nerd.&nbsp; I miss music, i need to listen to music more. 

I can't wait for Thanksgiving :-) 
My dad's birthday is tomorrow and I am going to be too busy with Anatomy and physiology dissecting a sheeps brain and im so unthrilled.&nbsp; i feel bad i cant be there for my dads birthday.&nbsp; well, on the other hand, brett and i are going on saturday to celebrate with them.

Hope everything is going well for everybody else!!! &lt;3"

I have officially withdrawn from my nursing course at UNE, but i am finishing the rest of my classes out for the semester.
I have applied to SMCC and hope to go there for general studies for the Spring 08 semester.

After transferring, I hope to get a better grasp on what i want to do.

YET AGAIN.

will probably just end up going back to looking into communications, as i had originally planned.

But i will find a flaw with it and will ultimately fail again probably.

I wish I could just bead my life away and make a living off selling my jewelry.

That, my friends, is what my heart desires.

(well, besides my baby&lt;3)

How can you go wrong getting paid for something you love to do?

I love beading, i love making jewelry, I love matching the colors and daring to place colors and different kinds of beads together to give it a flare.&nbsp; I love it.&nbsp; It's original, it's crafty, its fun.

I want to start selling my beading stuff (again, i attempted kind of once before but.. not really so you know how that goes). 

Everyone always compliments it, lets see if anyone steps up to the plate and buys some.

I would be so happy. &lt;3. LOVE.

Anyways, for now.&nbsp; I have Brett, Psychology, Anatomy and Physiology, and a silly English class to occupy me&nbsp; along with sending in all my application materials to SMCC, and transferring from SMCC in general.

HOORAY!!! Guess I have my worked cut out for me, as they say.

I need more motivation.&nbsp; ANybody up for the job?&nbsp; yaya for motivation, motivators, motivatees, and motives.

a tisket a tasket.&nbsp;&nbsp; i want to write a book.

I have crazy dreams.

I had a dream i went to the old port and got lost on my way home and some how ended up in york maine and couldn't leave.&nbsp; and there were all these crashed cop cars and cops running around everywhere shooting people and then there were like these insane civilians running around with machine guns.&nbsp; I was driving a bright blue 4x4 truck through this.&nbsp; (dont ask how i remember truck details, it was friggin weird).&nbsp; Somehow, i was with brett and we ended up in this concrete building and then this man came in and brett asked for help and the guy pulls out a gun and is like ""You can't leave for another year, the bridge is down.""&nbsp; so ten we were all how did we get here if the bridge is down?! and the guys is like.&nbsp; Thats&nbsp; a good fuckin question that id like to know the answer to and he points the gun at brett and i screamed and woke up.

I had one about visiting someone in jail, and in order to get out you had to climb this ladder.&nbsp; Well, i was the first one to climb the ladder and then all of a sudden we are in a gym and i reach the ground first andyou had to like climb up but then up became down so everyone behind me had to go down the ladder from the ceiling.&nbsp; Everyone was screaming and yelling at me because i wasnt balancing the ladder for them and they got stuck and couldnt get down.&nbsp; And this man comes over and starts yelling at me telling me i am a stupid bitch and i dont deserve to be here and kept telling me i was a worthless piece of shit and that no one cared about me and he kept getting in my face and then he just started hitting me and i was screaming and screaming for help, and there were people in the room and they just looked at me and left.&nbsp; No matter how loud i screamed, everyone just walked right by me.&nbsp; one snobby woman told me i was getting what i deserved.

You know what i think she deserved?&nbsp; To choke on the olive in her martini.

i dont know why my dreams are so vivid.&nbsp; I wake up in the morning and can describe almost every detail of it to brett.

I should start keeping a journal of my dreams.

Dreaming and beading, that is what i need to do.

Im wicked bored, and this has now become wicked long. and im really tired and kind of excited to see what i dream about tonight&lt;3

Ps. I want a puppy.&lt;3"

I love being with brett on our own.
It's incredible not having to worry about people nagging you to do things or having to figure out what to watch on tv.
He makes me so happy, and im so glad&nbsp; everything is working out so well.

School on the other hand is another story, but thats a story i do not want to get into until i know more of what is going on and such.

:-) I am incredibly happy with life (for the most part, when it is not involving school)

I have the most amazing boyfriend in the world"

"event","Today was like ......i dunno lol weird / full of dumbasses. Lunch was cool in a way, since the bird were all on one side of the lunch area i went and sat with jasmine. She sits with this guy that i had for 5th period last year he's cool i like his attitude not that everyone else is weird or anything its just that he is like laid back kinda like me. The three of us sat there talking about issues about dentisit and cars ect. until the lunch ended. When i was riding on my bus the stuid ass lady dropped me off at the corner 2 blocks away from where i lived i swear i dont know why i pay her for. Wow im like bored and i seriously crave for a game of poker man i have to give credit for the creator of the game game whoever it was is a badass well laterZ."

"event","Well where do i start? After my mom,sis and me left the house we heade for joaquin's house (my best friend)and picked him up in the carwe were dicussing issues about games and schoolfights til we got to town and country where we were left off. Once there we decide to goto Burgerking cause we were hungry and there we talked a wholemss of stuff and then we left. ""NOW THIS IS WHEN THINGS GET CRAZY!"" We went to flippers where we were playing a shooting game and joaquin tells me to come over to see something. All of a sudden i see all these medics and firemen (i dont know why the fuck they were there to begin with) and they had those beds with wheels where they put the victim turns out....A FREAKIN EMO BROKE HER LEG AFTER AN OUTRAGEOUSE TOURNAMENT OF ""DDR""!!!!!!!!!!! finally someone fucked themself up in that game XD XD!!!! Joaquin and me were like ""kids thats what happens when you play too much ddr"" we just couldnt stop laughing. Then we decided to head outside where she was gettingin the ambulence and her friends were ""CRYING""!!! the laughing got even worse joaquin was like ""WAA OH MY DDR FRIEND CANT PLAY DDR SIX WEEKS O-OH MY GWAD"" We were laughing like crazy until we got to ""radioshack"" (now this is when the shit really hitsthe fan big time) while we were walking and laughing these two guys and a chick came up to trying to get our attention. We thought they were buddys from school but....we just didnt know who the fuck these people were we thought they were gonna ask us for a smoke when all of a sudden they yelled......""HEY GUYS DO YOU BELIVE IN JESUS??!!!"" xD XD we couldnt belive we got jumped by CHRISTIANS!!!they were like telling us ""oh do u belive in heaven or hell? do you take jesus as your personal savior lord""we were like omg what just happened here?Then to make all worse joaquin was like ""oh im a jehova witness""!! i wanted to kill him later did we know we were there talking about and and stuff while the guys comments that out of curiosity he studied satism!!! we were like O_O wtf!! we couldnt belive this crap this was like some x files shit going on here. After half an hour talking about religion they were like ""WE WANNA PRAY FOR YOU GUYS"" and they were praying while all these people passed by i just wanted to die laughing. after they left we went tomarshalls where we met with my mom and we left and now im here so yeah. a word of wisdom out of this crazy saturday night 1. DONT OVERPLAY IN DDR CHANCES ARE YOULL FUCK YOURSELF UP LIKE MAYBE A LEG OR A HEART ATTACK ESPECIALL IF YOU AN EMO YOU MIGHT LOSE A FRIEND IN DDRER (DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION EMERGENCY ROOM)AND YOU MIGHT SLIT YOUR WRIST LATER ON. 2 WATCH YOUR BACK FOR CHRISTIANS THOSE ASSHOLES COME OUTAA ANYWHERE THEY BLEND IN AND EVERYTHING REMEMBER WHAT YOU MOM SAID ""DONT TALK TO STRANGERS"""

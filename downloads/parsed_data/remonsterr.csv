"event","i need to stop saying my days are good. it's like a curse. i was on the phone with helen wifying or whatever with her on guitar hero and i was like ""wow, today is so good. no homework, figured out how to use internet on wii, and hannukah presents tonight."" once we hung up, everything sucked. no present, shitty food, my ""best friend"" ebing a total bitch that made me cry and ended up joking about it in the end, and the one person i should be talking to about it is ""too busy"" because she was updating her new iphone.

why the fuck do i have friends?"

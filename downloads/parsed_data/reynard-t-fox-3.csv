I want to thank everyone that was at my sword making panel and everyone that attended the Atomic Battle of doom afterwards.

It was a very interesting experience I have to say ( just wish my back liked it as much as the rest of me did.)  I know that I'm still a beginner when it come to drawing.. but I also surprised myself with the decent (not great... or even good, but decent) final picture that I was able to do. The instructor was very laid back and seemed to like the fact that even though I'm new to this that I didn't ""Draw Mr. Peanut"" So that made me feel pretty good. Eventually I hope to be able to hone my art skills a bit more, but This is only a once a week class for 8 weeks.. so I'm not expecting THAT much from it.

"event","Well I did my part of a day trade last night and I thought I was going to have a easy night. And on paper it looked like an easy night too.. so I didn't really think anything was going to b a problem.............WRONG.


Well my plane arrives and I bring it into the hanger and get to work, knock out the service check (10 minutes since I was taking my time), the Routine Inspection (1/2 hour.. that's about normal), Threshold Inspection (5 seconds... no really.. 5 seconds), APU record (again 5 seconds) Day shift cleared the APU INOP MEL for me so I didn't have to do it (YEY zero seconds) and I had to replace the APU Starter/Generator because it's a time change item (45 minutes).. after that I was DONE. 10 hour shift.. that's all I HAD to do. (85 minutes 10 seconds) 

Well you would think this would be the end of the post.. but it gets better. 

I decied to be a nice guy and help the guys guys on their planes. and I ended up changing another APU Starter/Generator and 5 tires! (tires take about 1/2 hour each with all the paperwork)

Well I get done with all that and I grab some lunch because hey why not.. get back from lunch and we start pulling hte planes out of the hanger and sending them out to the gates for the morning flights and to test stuff that was fixed during the course of our shift. Well my plane is the last to come out of the hanger and I start it up just fine... except that the starter generator is puttin gout full voltage... but NO amperage! (This boggles my mind still... it dosn't make ANY sense what'soever.) 

So we have to pull my plane BACK into the hanger and try and figure out the problem. After about an hour of troubleshooting we deceide to take the starter/generator back out and put in another new one. 

This DOES fix the problem but now I feel like crap becuase it's is a rather easy thing for me to do (compared to some of the guys I work with.. because it's a VERY cramped little hole you have to work through and I'm skinny enough to do it) and I've been bragging that I can replace this faster then anyone there. The bigger guys at work have to take the whole tailcone of the plane off to even get to the part in question (2 hour total process for removal and reinstall).

well it turns out the part was bad from stock so it wasn't really my fault.. but it still feels like it was.


Well the moral of the Story is.... Don't day trade with people!, as things will ALWAYS go wrong!"

"event","Well my birthday was yesterday even though we celebrated it the other day as Muddie's parents came up from Cincinnati. We went to Resturant Japan where I got to see my mom eat sushi. (pay backs for all the years of her making me eat stuff I didn't like)
Other then that ""Gift"" I also received a new tool box for work, a Digital Camera and a Ipod Nano. So I can't really say it was a bad bday even if I am now 2011 years old. (you know... twenty eight, twenty nine, twenty ten, twenty eleven.. etc etc.)

Had to work last night and tonight.. but then we'll be off to Pittsburg for AC!

and the following week we'll be heading to LA for the Gathering of the Gargoyles. 

Wow june is packed.

Also I'll get the ""Furry Coffee's"" started up again in July once everything gets settled back to a more normal routine."

I've been fighting with finacial problems for quite some time now, this is no secret.

but I'm about to pull my hair out and I can't see the end on the tunnel that I'm apparently inside of.
I set aside the rent money for june in the back account (letting it sit there for as long as possible to TRY and earn a little interest... yeah right) and was going to pull it out yesterday to pay the rent either last night or this morning. Come to find out, that $250  of it is now gone. Seems that when you are given a recipt via email that you paid a bill.. is NOT an indication that the money has ACTUALLY been taken out yet... oh no.. this is just saying that they will take this amount at the most inopertune time possible. 

A bill that I paied online and got a receipt for over a week ago and that I actually thought was paid did this to me.

And here's the best part... while driving to work the windshield of the car cracks for NO APPERENT REASON WHATSO EVER. No rock bounced up from the car in front of no... nothing hit the window, no other damage other then the crack.

I guess I'm never supposed to have a good life. 

Ran may paychecks though a fine toothed comb and found out that I wasn't getting paid for the $0.25 raise I was supposed to get for my run/taxi certification.
I mean what the hell.. lets see if we can tack any more things on and see just home much I can take before I break.. I'll tell you right now.. it's pretty damn close to breaking right now.


I did one of those online test things to see if you are clinicly depressed or not... and it came back with a ""Very high risk"" score... yeah I saw that one coming.

Oh and one more thing.. Jeff ""The Instgator"" at work gets one my case last night at work to tell me that for what I'm paying in rent I should be living in a house to build up my equity and stuff. Even though he is techniclly correct he dosn't seem to grasp the reality that being as deep into debt as we are, there is no way we could possibly get approved for a loan to buy a house (yeah even more debt.. great)"

I hate even the though of me writing this.. but I'm going to see if it helps.

Recently there has been 2 deaths in my family, I wasn't really THAT close to these people, but that's not the point... they were family. It's hitting me alot harder then I would have imagined. That and compounded with all the money problems and and the stress of people only calling me when they want something from me. I never see my friends anymore... even though I now have weekends off.. I still don't see anyone. 

My job is going good.. and that seems to be the highlight of my life anymore, and in a way that makes me sad.. because it should be my wife. I admit it.. I have been neglecting her, not by choice.. but I know I have been doing it. I used to have this overwhelming passion to make everyone around me happy, (especially her) now it seems that all I want to do it try and make myself not depressed anymore.

I've tried to put on this happy face and act like there is nothing wrong.. and for the most part I think it's working.. but I never really see anyone anymore so it's hard to tell.

When I'm working, or playing a video game.. or just doing SOMETHING I don't notice the depression anymore.. so I've been trying to keep myself busy as much as possible with little things... This is part of the problem as I'm doing this stuff and not paying attention to a loving wife.

one of the things that I know would help is if we could get back on solid ground again moneywise. Before we got married I was on the right track.. I had most of the big stuff paid off and i was working on the rest.. it felt good to finally be getting things back in the right direction. But now that we are married I inherited a host of new problems. She has student loans to pay (which I had the GI bill for so this is a expense I'm not used to paying) and the collection people are calling every day for. We were forced to buy a new car when my old car died, and add in rent, utilites, food, and what not and my check is gone. I'm making more money now then I ever have.. but it seems I'm falling further in debt then I ever have before and I can;t understand it.

I'm seriously thinking about filing for bankruptcy."

Now for the real post.

Moved into the new hanger this past weekend, got to work in there for 1 day, then my days off... now I'm sick, so I missed another day.. and I'm prolly going to be ""Sick"" again so that I can stay ""Home"" and ""Recover"" (read as, ""Going to the Great Big Sea concert"")

Oh and in other but somewhat related news kinda.. My company picked up the maintance contract for Continental Express so my work load will prolly pick up a bit as well."

"event","Well yeah.... now I'm REALLY happy.

So after working a 15.5 hour work day I come home and see my wife for all of 5 minutes before she has to leave for work. Then I have to call the car people and find out what's going on... well because the car was TECHNICALLY repo'ed I have to pay the repo fee and 2 MONTHS of payments AND the Payment for Jan. (which isn't due till the 21st. but whatever) 
Well the STOOPID (yes it deserves the double OO for this one) people at Western Union fuck up and we have to do the whole thing over again... so by the time they are done the place where the car is, is now closed!!

so now I have to pay for 1 more day of storage but I can pick it up first thing tomarrow morning.  *sigh*

I fucking need a drink."

I called this morning to see if I could get an extension till tomarrow.. or thursday (since today is a bank holiday and isn't open to gain access to my money) but the lady on the other end wouldn't budge an inch...and would not let me extend the 10am (central time) deadline, she had the repo people waiting for me.

After having a full blown panic attack I went to my mom's workplace and promptly had anouther panic attack.

After regaining my composure my mom let me use her credit card to pay the bill, and i will pay her back. (most of you prolly already know that I don't have a great relationship with my parents to begin with... and I am still quite scared of my fathers reaction when he hears about this)

But I still want to thank you all for your support.

EDIT:

THEY FUCKIN' TOOK IT ANYWAY!!!
Holy shit I get home after getting this all taken care of and I goto bed (as I have to sleep during the day)
and the fuckers too my car, because Honda didn't cancel the repo order!!!
Now I have to wait till tomarrow to pick my car up out of the impound lot!!

Holy fucking shit!"

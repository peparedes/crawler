Nick took me out to dinner for my birthday, that was cute, hes a sweetie, i still miss him sometimes but im glad we are apart. besides he doesnt meet my new qualifications for a man.. 
car (most important) 
job
schooling
own appartment or house.. thats a perk.. 
jet skis....? possibly to much to ask for? can dream if i want to... 
nick pointed out the new qualifications are all the exact opposite of him... well... i have lived and learned and now i know whats acceptable. and not having a car isnt.
i need a beer... 
i watched a history of violence today... few... uhhhhh sex scenes were out of control... and i think you could make a drinking game out of how many times people got shot in the head... all in all it was a good movie. 
thinking about going downtown tonight with the girlies, lookin hot makin people want you is intiresting... last time we went we got raging drunk off crown and i dropped my friends purse in the toilet.. we were so drunk that we thought it was funny until the next morning when we both realized how UN funny it was.. especially because my phone met its maker... and i had to get a new one.. eh and i am told i made out with a forgin man... oooops"

im still feeling sick as fuck from that roll, ash asked me to go up to waco and get more tabs at 6 a piece, tempting....but as my tummy aced i denied the offer. (even tho she was just using me for my pimp ass car, trying to bribe me with cheap tabs) no more tripple stacked anything for a while. although it was tempting. im sticking to free beer, and white.
this girl at work who supplies me with my white asks me daily before our shift starts ""want to go skiing?"" cute way of saying ""want some white?""

"event","sooooooo last weekend myself and my new almost best friend ashley, (almost best friend cause she dosn't compare to my old best friends sarah haynes baby!, and amy, we get into little cat fights a lot aka both bitches) went up to dallas to visit all her old guy friends, we got there and went to this dealers appartment.... (they all seemed to be dealers). he, eric, was a real sweetheart and was handing out huge ass codine's for the few hours that we were there. so we stayed there drank, smoked, chilled untill about 9. then we went over to this guy tony's house, he is the one we were staying with, while there i met this guy named jake, he was really fucked up and funny as fuck. he gave me some adderal, my new obsesion is adderal, and they were the highest dose. so the whole pont for the trip was to go to this techno club called insomnia owened by the band pantera but it didnt open till four am, so we went to other clubs firt. we left tonys and went to another dealers house for tabs, then ash and tony popped them, i was scared and didnt want to because of my last tab i took two years ago... mdma death pill... gives me chills. so i took the huge ass adderal while they rolled. we went to a few clubs one was ghetto the other one was called club seven and it had some hardcore techno and beads and nice chairs totally high class they were rolling balls off and the adderal was fucking badass it felt like a halfway roll. fun fun. then 4 rolled around and it was time to  go to insomnia..
go there i finally took my roll, it was an amazing roll, especially with this techno and lazer lights... few rolling balls. it was nice. the club is unlike anything i have ever imagened. it was fucking badass, all they sell in the club is water, red bull and suckers. its ment for people to get FUCKED up and roll balls, and the people dancing there were fucking amazing. 
anyhow at eight in the morning we are all still rolling balls cause of the dealers keep giving you tabs if are a girl ex me! soooo we all go to a after party at this guys house. this is where it gets weird... we get there and there is about 30 of us from insomnia all fucked up chillin around this guys house. ****pause*** there is a very odd fad in dallas... pourposly taking the date rape drug. they call it g. the take caps fulls at a time, so half of us are fucked up on x and the other hald g. and this one guy was on acid, he said that the voices were telling him to kill my friend ash. weird. so we are there for like a hour when this lil white boy starts to ""g"" out... this means he took too much ""g"" he would pass out in a second and the people in the room would hit him or throw something at him and he would jump up and be like ""WHATTT?"" it was a trip to someone who had be rolling for 12 hours... more weridness, we were at the house and all of a sudden the man of the house starts screaming at his wife.. she is up staires fucking some other guy... so he runs after her and yells at all of us to get the fuck out,once again this is a trip to us who are fuuucked up. so we leave and ash goes home with this guy rick who she loves and i go with tony, we are both sooo fucked up (just took another tab count: 3ish) and want our rolls to keep going so we call eric to bring us some pot, he does and we get really rreally fucked up, we smokes some hash from idaho, fun fun... 
after that we go to the house where ash is at and then we all start to come down... sucks, tempers are flailing, tony and i decide to leave and go home and sleep. good idea...
go later pick up ash and go home.... she took a tab about a hour before i picked her up, her count: sixish, and i am yelling at her over the phone cause im coming down so she decides to take some g....to calm herself down... about an hour into our car ride she starts flipping out and saying GOOOOD CAIT IM SOOO FUCKED UP!!!! she starts skizzing out in my car and we both start jamming out to techno acting like complete crack hears... fun fun. 


lessons: 
dont drink out of anyones water bottle at insomnia
dont fuck the man of the houses wife, even if on g
do take tripple stacked blue dolphens...
dont yell at a girl who has taken 6 tabs and is coming down
dont make scared faces even when some scary black man is humping at your leg
dont make scared faces at drug dealers
do kiss up to dealers


side affects of taking 3ish tabs...
monday morning: fuuuked up soo tired from weeked.... had to work... spine hurts and fealt like killing someone, tired, sleep, not eating.
tuesday: back still hurts, sleeping a lot, fucking hungry as fuck, eat, throw it up, some where in this mad weeked i contracted a stomach bug.
wednesday: still not eating, bug continues to kill me. 
thursday: minus 12 pounds, like the skinnyness continue not to eat. 
friday: go clubbing, did some blow felt awesome, stomach hurts... blah... wore prom shoes, ouch. 
present time: slept till four, stomach hurts still... 

lession: no more tabs for caitlin for a while.

Last Tusday my car got hit by a fucking idiot 70 something year old lady.... she missed the protected arrow to turn left and it was just a plain green light, and i was going straight and she hit my ass. 
So she got out of her car, and me, of couse being very agressive, said, ""YOU fucKING HIT MY CAR!!!!"" she replys with this, 
""it's your fault"" 
This comment sets me off.
I say: ""WHAT!! You turned in front of me! How is that my faut if my light was green!"" 
Her reply: ""well... um my light was green too!""
I say: ""Im sure it was green but you still have to yield to oncoming traffic!"" 
She says: ""im calling the police""
Me: ""GOOD you run along and do that!"" dumb bitch
After she called the cops she tried to come up to my window to attempt to speak to me, I gave her the finger and told her to get the fuck away from my car... 
The police arrive 30 minutes later and that she had done enough dammage for one day.
I tell the officer, who is sadly dumber then shit, that i had the right away and she hit me cause she is old and crazy.
He believes me and gives the lady a ticket, FUCK YA! 
Anyhow she fucked up my car bad, the inside frame is bent, the light smashed out, ( i got a ticket for the light being out later that night, what a awesome day), side pannel bent to hell, and the hood is totally fucked. 
i had to tape up the light cause the rain kept making it go out cause it was exposed, so im really embarrased while driving...   
Anyhow, she is going to have to pay for all of it, and a rental car for me while my car is in the shop! that hooker."

Donnie Darko the directors cut came out Tuesday!!!! Yea! Fucking badass movie, everyone should see it, especially cause of Jake G. SOO fucking insanely beauiful. 

I like to drink... hooray for The Captain 

I went to this badass stripper clothes store, called Le Rouge, next to Dreamers. And got a badass stripper halter, they had stripper shoes too!!!! Loved it. When you come in and buy something they automatically give you 10% off, a free thong, and $20.00 store credit sent to you on your birthday. NIICE."

New Orleans Trip:
*went to new orleans for a week, got satisfyingly (spell?) drunk, a lot, at first i was scared to ask for alcohol, but i did and i guess that i look 21 cause no one id'ed me. which was nice. 
*working a lot cause i am poor due to the drunkness in new orleans, fucking 8 dollar martini's. after about three or four of them the tab seemed to go up quite high... bastards. 
*when we were in new orleans my mommy and i went on a hunted house tour, the tour guide was about 25 i bet and kept hitting on me throughout the whole tour, my mother and i thought it was sad, and kinda cute.
*got lots of cute shot glasses. one has a alagaror on it. 
*went to the Husler store in new orleans, i wanted skanky hooker boots but they cost a lot. so i got a pink shot glass that says ""husler- think pink"" it's cute. it has glitter. 

Other Shit:
*we are getting our house re-modled: walls knocked down, windows broken, paper peeled off, ect. 
*i got sick, im really sick now, i keep sneezing, im all snoty. that is a gross word. been sick for a week maybe. anyhow it sucks.  
*havent been really wanting to write in here, dont know why, i suppose it is cause i dont care. and it is stupid. 
*im annoyed that i dont use puncuation throught out my entries. but once again im sick and i just dont give a damn."

*got the nails done again... they look BEAUTIFUL!
*ate lunch with nick, well i watched him eat, im on a new animal cracker and vegetable diet, it's working so far... im seeing myself falling into my anorexic thinking pattern again, for me it first starts with the compulsive working out, ive got that covered. working out at the gym three times a week and now im doing pilates off of a dvd, that is KILLING me by the way, i did it for three minutes the day before yesterday and i am still  SO fucking sore today, could barley walk yesterday, i was like waddleing around like a duck, pathetic.
*nick made another beautiful ring for me today, its so awesome, fits perfect, i love him tons. 
*i think im add, i saw a commercial on it and i had all the ""symptoms"" 
*i also am out of birth control pills, but i cant find the new place to get them in rr, when the hell is the fire station in rr, the lady says its near there. so im thikin of avoiding the hassel of trying to find the place and just going to a real dr and gettin them, think they will cost more?
*going to ohio for christmas, nicks family ended not enviting me to aspen, lil fuckers.
*i have tons of homework i need to do, but i think since i have add i dont want to do it, thats what one of the sympoms was, ""not wanting to finish stuff, having trouble concentrating"" 
*braided my hair today, im glad its long enough to braid now, and the red color still looks fucking badass, next time i dye my hair i want to do it black blue, my mom might freak tho, eh fuck it. 
*i miss seeing my family, the only time i see them is MAYBE at night, or if they come to see me at work, im just always working and or with other people. 
i*m excited to go and do christmas shopping! yea for x mas, i tried to do some the other day but i ended up just buying stuff for me... sadly, that happends a lot. 
*watched enternal sunshine of the spotless mind- made me want to dye my hair bright blue like nicks! but i have a feeling that it would not look as good on me as it did on that chick in the movie. and once again, me madre would freak out. 
*there is a guy at work who says im spoiled because my mother pays for everything that i need, he was like 'MY MOM KICKED ME OUT WHEN I WAS 16!!!!!' ' I HAD TO SUPPORT MYSELF AND MY SISTER!!!!"" i just looked at him and said ""hun.. that is SO not my fault SO CHILL OUT MAN!' 
he was yelling hardcore at me, but he has also fallen madly in love with me, told me i have that effect on people, which i tend to believe cause a few paople have proffesed their love to me before, so anyway he appologized very fast after i yelled back at him.. can we say WHIPPED. 
im bored of wriiting."

This spanish speaking cook saw my idiotic jump and saw it hit my forehead... So he made me this hot salt water shit with spices in it and tried to tell me that it would stop the swelling. It was like he was playing pictionary trying to use his hand to describe how the swelling would deminish if I used this shit. Ya well the fucking water pitcher left s huge bruse and it looks nasty.. it still hurts, and I did it two days ago. 
*Noticed an actual DENT in my car from that fucking deer... fucking bastard.
*Hit a bird in my car last night, scared the shit out of me.
*Saw The Grudge.... FUCKING SHIT! AHHH scary as shit. Seriously I never want to see it again! Nick even said he was mucho scared, and he never gets scared, I had bad dreams. 
*Nick, his sister, and I went 
*I need to get on pills... I need paranoia pills, I am seriously paranoied about everything, it's disgusting.
*Got about three random drunk phone calls last night... all of who left messages... cause I was sleeping and im  a super evil bitch when I get woken up, and I hung up on all of them. I must say that Ryan Gholson left the best one. He was SOOOO fucked up. Told me I MUST come to Lubbock to see him. Silly boy. 
*AHHH Trent came into Applebees yesterday, I turend around and there he was AND his dad and practically stepmom, Carly, they were in my section too... also very odd and awkward. As they were leaving Craly said to me, ""GOODBYE DAUGHTER!!!"" Implying what I believe was that she considers me part of the family... Like with trent. I was like ""BYE?"" good god.

INTO MY STOPPED CAR! I mean what the fuck, it flew onto the hood of my car then hit my windshield then bounced onto the road... left a skid mark on the hood of my car... it was really quite pathetic... fucker pissed me off tho... damn right he didnt leave any dents... or else its open season on deer in Serenada... bastard would of gotten his ass shot and cooked. 

Work is good, it's really fucking fun actually, everyone is really badass, and our bosses give us money. For example, if I were to recomend one of my friends at Applebees and they actually applied and got hired, and stayed working there for 60 days,  I would recieve $100 bucks. If two of my friends got hired there, and stayed for 60 days... then i would recieve $200... Nice. 
POINT OF STORY! Apply at Applebees and say you know me! 

We have to dress up at work for Halloween next week... Saturday, and Sunday... Maybe that will be fun... 

So last night it rained right.... ya well my window oddly leaks... So after the rain stopped,  well you can guess what happens when the rain stops... ANTS.. the ants start to build there lil ant mounds... well some ohhhh id say a few hundred ants found there way into my room... YA thats right INTO my ROOM! I walked into the doorway and was automatically attacked my like four of them! LITTLE FUCKERS WERE EVERYWHERE! I was so disgusted! So I woke up my mother in a panic and all she told me to do was get some spider killer and spray them.... cha not so easy... there were soo many. It was really gross. Anyhow, there they were walking in little perfect lines so i took my shoe to them and grinded them into the floor, the vaccumed my entire room then sprayeed the spider killer EVERYWHERE... no ants today. : )"

I need to find a new girl friend. Not in a gay way. I only chill with Nick and occasionally the people at work. BUT all the girls there I don't really like enough to chill with outside of work. The guys tho... they are cool. But Nick gets mad and accuses me of cheating on him with all of my 'boyfriends' from work. What the fuck. He works with really good looking women, and you don't hear me bitching about anything. Ya okay, maybe I bitch a little. But not excessively. 
Damn. I had a huge list of shit I was supposta do today. None of which got done due to my procrastinating. I'm bad about that. I have a huge paper due Thursday... im thinking of just not going to class, it's not like our whole class ever comes to class eather tho.

Thats what they are supposto do right? Stop when you run out of money.... Ya NO. After my card was ACCEPTED I wanted to check my balance to check how much ""money"" I had in the account... 

Oh ya... NEGATIVE $60.75! WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!! 
So I was obviously pissed.... YA! 
I went over to the rude young man at the Bank of America store to ask why the FUCK I was in the NEGATIvE! I mean really it's just pathetic. He said that everytime I run out of money (first time) and use my card, it subtracts $17 the first two times and the next 5 times it's $33! GAY! Oh and here is where it gets better, apparently I ran out of money on Saturday (unknowingly) BUUUTT I used my cary twice yesterday thats another $66 dollars added to my account. FUCK YOU OVERDRAFT!!!!! bastards... im so poor. I am never poor, this will be hard. 
But my mom did give me $100 cause she felt bad... but I bet she will make me pay her back. 
Fucking overdraft Nazi's in total charged me $120 for $20 dollars of stuff I paid for... So that four dollar magazine is costing me 33! How fucked up is that?

We stayed at this totally badass hotel called The Magnolia it was right in the middle of Dallas, it was so badass, I stayed up late and drank with the bartender and the other staff people we all played pool, awesome. YEA for cool barteners who give me alcohol! 
Then the next day (Sunday) we went to the Dallas Dillards Outlet store, it was where all the old clothes go that they dont sell, ya well i got like 6 shirts and 2 skirts and a badass jacket for 20 bucks. Very nice. Everything was like 5 dollars. 
When we were coming back from Dallas we stopped at this place in Waco that is called the ""Czech Stop"" they had insane shirts in czeck, I got one that said ""will give kisses for beer"" its badass.

I didn't make that in like 4 days working at that fucking coffee place. Bastards.
Turns out I didnt have to take out my nose ring, I just take it out when the crazy manager who hired me is working, which isnt that often. 

Nick is finally getting a job, im proud, he will be working at Wild Fire in Georgetown, this is good, cause we will both be making shit loads of money and I wont have to pay for everything all the time. 
Nick and I are gonna be hippies for halloween, good fun. I wanted to be a Heroine strung-out hippie, but my mother decided that was strange and not such a good idea.

I can always get the other side pierced someother time... damn. I have been thinking of things I could do to get around it... just cant. Unless it's an old enough piercing to not have a ring in there and not close up for 4 hours... Lets see.. I got it July 4th, ummm it's 3 months old... maybe it will stay, I tried to put the clear one in.. that bastard is a lot larger than the ring I normally use, I started tearing up as I pushed it in. Then ten seconds later I took it out cause of the fucking pain. Damn, im just gonna take it out for good. 
*Got my hair cut today, it's cute as hell, I got bangs, and with my silly glasses I look like some teacher in the adult video business... Damn.. thats not a good thing now that I think about it, it will grow... slowly im sure tho. Damn once again.
*Fucking ACC tried to drop me from my english class cause I never signed up for some gay math class, so now they added the fucker onto my schedule so I have to have the whole book finished by ohhhh December. Figures, only that would happen to me. 
*I need to take pictures of the nose ring.. seein as how it must be gone by tomorrow at 3:00, thats when I start as a ""server"". Waiting tables is easy as hell, I have always thought it was easy money, expecially at Applebee's. Lots of people go there. The managers name is Alfreado, like the pasta, hes so cute, he can barley speak english, so silly. 
*I have decided to name my damn fish Perdo, I hate him, he used to be called Amalia but that's when I wanted him to be a girl.. then I felt bad about always calling him a girls name, then I was annoyed that I was considering that the fucking fish had feelings.

So his Birthday is on October 27th, i want to get him lots of stuff beacause I don't know what all his parents will get him, he says they always forget about his birthday. He gets his wisdom teeth pulled out 10 days before his birthday, (and as we all remember I had that done a few weeks ago, and i couldnt eat anyhting good for like 3 weeks) and I told him that we are going to go out the day before his surgery and eat at a very nice place and eat a shit load, cause he wont be able to eat anything yummy for a while. That was one thing I was pissed about the teeth situation, that i wanted good food not soup... Ya that whole situation was awful. I love the boy what can I say.

yesterday i sat around and didnt do much, since i was sick i slept a disgusting total of 14 hours... jesus christ, thats just not healthy. people kept calling my phone and i aparently would pick up and mumble shit and then hang up on them, thats what my brother said.. im a mean sleeper, expecially if woken. i remember trents brother calling me but i thought it was a dream, it wasnt... i wonder what i could of said to him? ah oh well. 

talked to Lee, he is nicks look alike person from louisville, kentucky. he was really nice, he facinates me, i am sad tho, because he seems sad and he was so nice. i liked him. but he rarley gets online so i never get to speak with him. 

got my car back, the fucking ac is colder then fuck! i sadly end up opening the windows cause it gets to cold... and thats just pathetic because thats whe whole reason i got the fucking ac fixed, so i would not have to open my windows.

i asked ken to send me one of the a perfect circle cds, the one with the sexy ""FUCK YOUR GOD"" yelling its just to hot for words. so thank you ken. :) i love it!

im kinda bummed amy is leaving. she is like my only girl friend.. im gonna miss her a lot. 

looking for a new job, i re-applyed at monument cause im a bitch ass pussy.. i swore to myself i would never work there again... but.. they were hireing and i prolly have a good chance of gettin re-hired there.. seein as how i worked there for a fucking year and a half! bastards.."

"event","so my online journal format thing changed.. it is throwing me off for some reason, it confuses me. so yesterday i had to take my fucking car into the shop.. goddamn ac was broked, and i dont even get it back till tonight, i am like stuck at home going freekin crazy. i wrote my english paper or at least tryed to alllll day yesterday and i only got like 300 words... ya to bad i need 850, i think im gonna just turn it in with about 500 words.. im an underachiever. eh fuck it, he like is an easy grader and will prolly not even notice. so my brother and i woke up at like 5 this morning to work on it, but we did a lil and decided it was best to go back to sleep.. typical... ya we like to sleep in this family.. my fucking boss called me yesterday morning at like 7 and told me i HAD to work yesterday and today... but i RE-INFORMED him that i will tell him when i can come in. he was like ""oh... ok well can you possibly come in on frieday"" ya thats right bitch back off.. he knows he cant piss me off cause im like the only person who will work there cause he is a weirdo. and he even scares me but i put up wiht him.. then there is this damn arab that owns the subway next to our shop.. he likes to comment on my arms... such as wow, you have a lovely shade of armhair.. when i heard that i like wanted to run away crying. then the day before yesterday he reaches over and grabs my arms and says ""woy have so much blood in your arms caitlin"" im thinkin ok for one GET OFF OF ME! and for two WTF are you talking about! jesus christ he pulls that shit one more time and im gonna put him in jail for a long time!

"event","so ya... im upset... with nick, i dont know what to do with that boy.. break up with him? tell him he needs to pull his life together before we can get back together... thats what i need to tell him... 
but seriously i dont know anymore, he seems distant, he tells me he loves me all the time, but i dont think thats enough. i NEED him to show me that he loves me, not that he can just say it to me with a straight face, thats no good. he wont talk to me about stuff like this and it upsets me so badly, he hurts my heart, i need someone who can be with me more then 2 hours then tell me he wants to go chill with his bitch of a sister.. bullshit i say... bastard. so im gonna start finding new men, ok yall! new boys for caitlin. she needs someone new... 
and the sad thing is i have been with him for so long i cant even imagine my life without him in it... thats gonna be a hard thing to let go (if i do break things off) but ya.. i need something new. gr... word of advice, DONT DO LONG TERM RELATIONSHIPS... fucking christ, you end up like me, blabbering on and on. 

so anyhow: my car is broken, actually it has been broken for so long i cant even remember how long it has been since it actually worked.. dammit. well this time around the fucking AC is broken...ohhh wait hold on now i remember.. it broke last week then i got the freon fixed (may i add that the freon was like 60 busks) then it worked for a week or so, now it is broken again, the compresser i am told... bullshit. the goddamn fucker is gonna cost (JUST THE ONE FUCKING COMPRESSOR PART...) 800 fucking dollars... fucking christ, my car as a whole prolly would not even sell for that much money... i even get a NEW car in a month... but noooo my mom tells me that we must get it fixed cause it wont EVER sell without an ac.. that is true, i guess... once again FUCK MY CAR! gr, i've hated that car since the second day i had it, (when i broke the trans... that sooo was not my fault tho.. i think... goddamn manuals) anyhow... ya fuck it, grr i hope i get the civic i want.. DON'T BUY MAZDA 626'S!!!"

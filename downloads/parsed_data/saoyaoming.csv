"event","<p><font size=""4"">Dear Journal,<br />I have been so stressed out for the past 2 weeks.</font>&nbsp; <font size=""4"">David Holt, the guy I use to talk to until him and his ex got back together decided to call me up one night and it was surprising. Didn't think I would ever talk to him again. We talked and he told me that he missed me and couldn't wait to see me..at this point, I'm like okkkkk? What about Timberly? Supposedly, he broke up with her bcuz she was still irresponsible and still wanted to live in a silly life. I could care less that he was coming back to town. I was over him. Then he kept calling me days before he actually got into town. One night, he calls me and wanted to see me and I didn't want to see him so I made an excuse that I had to do my friends hair and then I have to work at 7am and I was dead tired from the night before when I went clubbing and afterparty at my apt(which that was true). He said he won't keep me up and that he really needed to see me. I say, ummm what about timberly? Why don't u go see her?(I didn't know that they broke up). He said that he had broken up with her. Im like, ya sure watever. He says that he swore to god and he really needed to talk to me and be with me becuz he has been thinking about me for the past 5 months...(this sounds like bullshit to me)...but he kept convincing me that he is over timberly and that he wants to be with me and start dating. Im like, is he out of his mind??? I havnt seen him in like 5 months and HE wants to date me...that sounds like bullshit! I know what he wants..he just wants a piece of ass cuz he hasnt gotten any!! I kept telling him that I can't see him that night cuz i was too busy and had to go to sleep early...and then he makes the excuse that hes not doin very good right now and that he feels lonely and feels he doesn't have any friends. I felt bad for the guy so i said ok, come on over around 1:30am. I told him that nothing will happen between me and him and that we're just friends. He says that he can't promise anything because he has missed me so much and all he can think about his kissing me. I felt like this boy had some magic lovespell on him or something that is making him think this way. I said no! Nothing will happen tonight! And he says we'll just have to see what happens. I didn't want us to end up having sex like we always do when we see each other because I feel used afterwards. He never calls me during the daytime, we've never hungout besides nighttime, I barely know him and when he does call, it's only when he needs somethin. ..all i feel is that he just wants a piece of ass. I wanted to get to know him but the time was never right. So he comes around 1:30 and I went downstairs to open the door for him and I gave him a hug, went upstairs and just talked about how it was in the military. He tells me that he is being sent to Iraq in two months for a year. Right then and there, I didn't want to start anything with him. Davone, her boyfriend, bunkim and david comes over to drink for a lil while..i was glad because it was kinda stalling things....they left within an hour and it was just me and david again. I put in Blade to watch and he turns off the lights. Im like...o shit...i sit in the recliner and he was sittin on the couch and asked me to come over there and I didn't want to but he came over and dragged me there. I sat next to him and he laid his head on my shoulder...i asked him, what are we david?? and he responds...we're dating. (thinking in my head, dating??? how so?) and then i asked him, then wat about tomorrow? he says...dating...im like surrreee...watever...and he tells me that he has missed me and bullcrap like that and i tell him straight up that Ive been with guys who have used pickup lines and sweet talked to me and then i spill my guts to them and then they end fucking me over in the end. I told him I didn't want that to happen with him and of course he reassured me that he wasn't going to do that....things led to another and he ended up spending the night until i had to take my sister to school. We said our goodbyes and after that day, I still havnt heard from him. I texted him and everything and askin y is he ignoring me. Still no answer from him. I felt so stupid and used. I knew that he was goin to do that to me but i fell into his trap. I couldn't help myself because i thought that maybe we would actually get somewhere. I hate guys........Life isn't easy for me right now and david is only making it harder for me....</font></p>"

I have too much on my mind anyway to party and don't need to get into trouble with the law either. Dusty is sleeping cuz of course, he has to work in the morning...unlike me, i work at night on the weekends. Tsk, I don't know what to do with myself...already got onto myspace and facebook and they bore more than ever now. Gna go watch the UFC fight next month and I can't wait! I know some of the guys fighting so this should be interesting. I kind of want to go jogging right now....hmm...maybe tomorrow...I need to get my toes redone. I hope this summer will be fun. Im excited for it actually. Want to go on more roadtrips with my best buddies. Dusty was telling me the other day that his friend and his gf broke up....reason? cuz he wants to be single...and then doosty was saying how his friend said his ex was perfect for him and that wished that he couldve met her when they are 25...right now he just wants to be single i guess...That got me thinking about a lot of stuff from the past...how I wished that some things that happened in the past could happen when i turn 23 or something..young love to me wouldn't work out anyway because people change and&nbsp; want to experience something else out there instead of being attached. Since Im single, a lot of shit is going throught my psychotic mind...haha jk. im no psycho. but anyway, im running out of things to say...ttyl!<br /><br />giao</font>"

"event","<strong><font color=""#ff0000"" size=""3"">Dear Journal,<br />So I start off the day by waking up at 5 am to take my mother to work because yesterday, she got pulled over and got a ticket for her muffler being too loud...so now I have to take her everyday until she gets that fixed. UGH! After takin my mother to work, I had to drop off my sister at school and then went back to sleep at my mother's place until 11. Got up and got ready for my 12:30 class which was religion. Usually that class is suppose to end at 5 but we usually leave an hour before. Today, we talked about Buddhism. Interesting stuff I tell ya. Stuff that I don't even know. Then after that class, just came back to my mother's house again and ate food cuz I was a hungry bastard..lol then after that, I had my next class at 5:45 which is Microbiology and lasted till about 8:30. My ass hurts, let me tell ya..So yea and now I'm enjoying an awesome meal which is short pasta noodles with spaghetti sauce and mushrooms. My cousin also pissed me off today by telling me his bad news...which was that he can't move in with me in my apartment because he's retarded. After my hard work of trying to find him a job and all that for at least 2 months, he decides that he won't be able to help me out...Fuck...So now I have to pay full rent by myself until I can get me another roomie. But it pissed me off cause he knew that I really wanted him to move in cuz I don't trust anybody else anymore. Only like family members I can trust&nbsp;since my last situation got me screwed up. But I was sooOoO pissed when he told me. I knew something like that was goin to happen and he's the type of person that I can't really rely on. GRRR! I just want to choke him! But anyway...At the Bridal Show that i went to with Yadira Sunday morning, we filled out little registration forms for drawings for free stuff. We didn't think we would win anything so we just left right after the bridal dress show cus we weren't gna wait another 2 hours for the drawings cuz chances are, we weren't gna win jack. But I got a voice message from a lady from Mary Kay saying ""Congratulations"" and that I won a shopping spree and also get to get pampered. So&nbsp; I was pretty excited about that cuz I'm so stressed out right now. So that made me happy...=) Anyway, Im gna get back on myspace so Ill talk to u later.</font></strong><br /><br />"

"event","<b><font size=""4"" color=""#333399""><font size=""3"">Dear Journal,<br />It has been awhile since I have been on this!!! WoW! But anyway, I just needed to write my thoughts and feelings about stuff and be able to look back on them in the future. I looked back at the old entries that I have made and man, was I stupid. lol But life is going well so far. It's been almost a year and a half that I have been single and it's the longest ever. I was talkin to 4 people in between, but found out that they weren't what I needed. One was a major slut and now dates one of my friends who I don't talk to anymore and the other is in the army. He left about 3 days ago. I'm sad that he left but at the same time, I only saw him as a friend. But you kno what upsets me? Just guys who think that they can just use me. When it comes to guys, it seems like I fall for them too easily. But in the end, I realize that I don't want them anymore and leave them. Efrain was someone who I really liked. He was also the most cockiest, conceited, prettyass fucker that I have ever met and talked to. Sometimes I question if he's gay. It really killed me when he and Diamona started talking. I just couldn't believe that a friend would actually do that behind my back. But it doesn't matter anymore. It does feel weird to see them together tho. I mean, she said shes my friend and all and we're suppose to stick up for each other, but she's been ignoring me lately. Probably cuz of the reason that me and her bf had something going on. Then there was Mr. Brandon Jones who I was also talking to while I was talking to Efrain. Haha I was pretty bad. I mean, I wasn't looking for a relationship. But one problem was he was a year younger than me and was still in high school and he went to Waukee. But it pissed me off when I found out that Brandon had a gf all along that went to Valley and didn't find out until like a month and half of knowing each other. it made so much sense because the was he was acting and just suspicious signs. He was a cutie tho.Then I was talking to Mr. Nick Leanos about 3 months later. We've only messed around but didn't go anywhere since he had gotten into a lot of trouble with the law. Weird how things turned out. I have liked him since like what, 5th grade and we actually talked? It's so weird. I remember being with him and it was like a dream or somethin. Didn't feel real at all. It wasn't the same crush from back in the day. I didn't really care if we were bf and gf or not. I suppose that I didn't like him like I use to or it was just ehh...But o wells...and David...david, david, david...He just used me too. He recently broke up with Timberly cuz she cheated on him like 5 times and david found out about all of them at once. He's foolish too and forgave her. FUCK that..I wouldn't have forgiven her. I started talkin to him after they broke up but I can tell that he still loves her. He done things out of love to get her attention. For example, he overdosed. tsk tsk tsk...that right there just made me careless. Obviously hes still loves her and wanting her attention but she was a bitch and ignored him and even when he was hospitalized. But months passed and she came crawling back to him like i knew she would. Only that it was too late and he had already joined the army. I think he joined the army just because of her. He had told me his future plans with her and how he wanted to marry her. I thought that was very very sweet of him. But I knew wat kind of monster Timberly was and that it wouldn't work out with him and her cuz she can do it again to him and hurt him 10 times worse. But I think they're tryin to work things out now but after he comes back from the military. *sigh*&nbsp;<br /></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size=""3"">Sometimes I wonder if this is were I want to be in my life. I have a great job that I love because I get free tanning and lotion and much more better pay. Im concentrating on getting better grades for this semester cuz I HAVE to make it into the Nursing Program. I have my own apartment. But one thing is missing is having a boyfriend. Having a boyfriend to me is being able to be stable. Having someone to keep an eye on me, someone to talk to, someone that would have my back, someone who would listen to my problems and comfort me when I'm down. I don't have that. And I really miss it. =( It's stupid for me to think about this but lately I have been thinkin about JT lately and it hurts me how I didn't give him another chance. and that I chose to be with been. How stupid was I? And now that I look back, he was the best person for me. Now that I am more maturer, I realize that I was very very selfish, jealous, and an idiot. My behaviors that cost me the love of my life. But I plan to use the knowledge that I know now to help my relationships in the future(if I ever have one). Ben to me was something I thought I wanted but I was a naive little person. He wasn't someone I wanted to be with. For the past 2 nights, I have been reading the notes that me and Jt had been writing to each other since the first time we actually wrote each other and I'm planning on reading them ALL. Im only 1/3 done. Yea I kno it's foolish for me to linger in the past, but it haunts me. I'm known for a person who likes to linger in the past. But I don't care. I don't have a life and I can if I want to. But I wish that I can have a second chance with james someday, maybe not right now but someday. I'm pretty sure that he's so in love with his current gf right now cuz that's how he is. When he loves someone, it's like rock solid and nothing can get in the way of the feelings. I kno cuz i've been there. So I know I can never get in between their relationship bcuz his mind is already set in his gf. Who knows, maybe someday they'll get married and my chances are none. But if that happens, then that's good for them. I know I should move on to other people that amy have the same characteristics as him but I just don't want to get hurt anymore. I don't want to search. I just want him. Reading those notes just somehow relieved me but at the same time hurted me cuz I wish that I can have him again. Also, another realization that I have came to is having a boyfriend benefited me. I had much more better grades and right now, my grades are wayyyy bad. Almost to a suspension to my scholarships. My freshmen year in college, I partied too hard because I was single and I was getting over a relationship and the only way was to party and drink club&nbsp;drink drink club drink and did I say drink? and some more hardcore drinking. That's not what I really wanted. I mean sure drinking is a lot of fun but not when ure consistently doing it every other day and weekend. No wonder my grades are so bad. But I just want a second chance from god and from the person that really changed my life by entering it. Life had full of surprises and I hope I don't get the bad ones again sometime soon. I just want someone in my life that can just put me in my place. I want that authority and i want the love. So i pray every night that I can have my life back again. Even though there are big changes right now, I still pray that I get what I deserve cuz I kno I deserve so much better.&nbsp;<br /></font><br /><font size=""3"">Sincerely,&nbsp;<br />Giaoseph</font><br /></font></b>"

"event","<STRONG><FONT color=#cccccc>Dear Journal,<BR>I feel like I have neglected you. Im sorry. Ill tell you about my day. My day went well. Woke up at about 11:40ish. Got ready. Ben picked me up to go to SacredSkin and get my tattoo done. Yes. I got my tattooey. I got a fairy on my lowerback. It's cute so far. Itll brighten up later. It hurted the whole time my artist was doing it. The lower he went, the more pain it was to me. It took about an hour or more to do it. It hurted so much that it was annoying. Like it gave me a mad headache. Yea...so we got done at about 3. Ben dropped me off cause he had to take his sister to driver's ed. I laid on my bed and was knocked out. Getting a tattoo makes u sleepy. Then woke up, went to Walgreens to buy my ointment for my tattoo, then took my gpa to the asian store, came home, got online, went to watch ""The Longest Yard"" at Nova. That was a good movie. Didn't think that it would be a good movie but it turned out good. I went with my cousin Randy. I wanted to go to the club so bad tonight but I can't because of my tattoo. Im afraid that people will rub against it so I dont want to risk that. Anyway...that was pretty much my day!</FONT></STRONG>"

That's all i have been doin lately. I love it. Ben came back home from Colorado Tuesday(19th) late at night. I saw him the next day and he bought me a present and he got me an armband for my ipod. I thought it was very thoughtful of him. </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ffcccc>Today, Benjamin and I went to Birdland Pool. We got in Free because Eric works there and he was working. It was fun swimming with Ben. He's so funnie and adorable. After the pool, we went to watch ""Kicking and Screaming"" at Nova. It was an ok movie but the ending was so cliche. And then, after the movie, we went to Dahl's to cash me check. After that, we headed back to his house. Sat around, looked at family reunion pics, his All-Stars pics that his mom ordered, and ate dinner. After that, we went down to his basement and played SuperSmash Bro. It was fun. Im always Yoshi or Pikachu and hes always Samus. Yea, we compete so much. I always beat him tho...=P Yea and I stayed there till 12:30am. Yea...it was a great day and night. </FONT></STRONG></P>

He'll be gone for a week and will be back on July 9th...but still, Ill have noone. No one to hold and cuddle with. He's going there for a church project thingy. Then he gets to go to an amusement park or something. Then like 4&nbsp;or 5 days after he gets back, he's off to Colorado for his grandparent's 50th Anniversary. I guess they're celebrating it up there since they live here. *sigh* and then in the fall, he's going to be everywhere since he's playing soccer for Grandview. He only has 6 home games. That's a bummer. Ill prolly wont see&nbsp;him very much either even tho we go to the same school. </FONT></STRONG></P>

<P>Wow...I graduated...it's so sad. What do&nbsp;I do now? All I can really do this summer is chill. Graduation was awesome. The only time I cried was when I had to hand a rose to my significant person. It was a special moment between me and my mom. I had teary eyes. I ran all the way to the balcony to give it to her. Though things with me and her wasn't so good in the beginning part of my life, she's still my mom and I love her. Anyway, my uncle from Minnesota and his two lil girls drove all the way down just to my graduation and then left back to Minnesota like at 4:30. I appreciated that he did that. It was good to see them. Yesterday was Bennie's graduation party. I wanted to go to other grad parties but Katy had to spend time with her family and I didnt have a ride. So I just stayed at Ben's the whole time. Yep...he got a lot of money from his friends and familia. After his grad party, we went to Mike Solinger's grad party. We all just chilled there. Ben was playing his light saber like a lil kid that he is. After Mike's, we headed to Jammy Lovan's grad party in Cottonwood. We were too late. It was already over and I met up with Katy there. Yea so we just decided to go camping with Mike, Katie, Katy, David, Anh, Stoltze, Tony, and Ben of course. My first experience camping but me and ben didnt spend the night. Yea, there was a lot of bitching with the guys. So unorganized. The white people planned it...haha...In the beginning, we got bitten so badly my mosquitoes. Bug spray didnt work. So when Katie and Mike arrived, they bought some inscent that got rid of em. Anyway...Ill just talk to u later!</P>

<P><FONT color=#ccccff><STRONG>Whats goin on? Not much here. Just downloading music. yea...Today we had a game against SE Polk and unfortunately, we lost. O well, good luck with Valley! We went into a shootout. First time ever. Yea i was pretty mad about Brad putting Becca as goalie for the shootout. I wanted to do that since it was our last game. He's dumb. I was so ready to do it too. I was pumped! GRR!!!...O well, didn't want to play Valley anyway...Today, I went to the dentist to put my crown on my tooth. Bennie boy took me. Yea and while we were heading to the mall, he told me to look in his glovebox for his receipt for his watch. Surprise surprise, there lies my graduation gift from him!! He did it on purpose...hehe...It was a jewelry box from Brodkey's. I opened it up in the car and it was a ring! It was so beautiful. I love it so much. We took it back to Brodkey's to resize it. Get it a lil bigger. I lost the first one he gave me so I have to make sure to not lose it. Told me to never take it off...lol...so cute. Wants me to be able to wear on my graduation day on Saturday. Yea...his commencement it on Friday at 7pm. After resizing my ring, we went to Sunglass Hut to get rid of some links on his watch. After that, we just walked around the mall. He bought cargo shorts from Old Navy, he bought me and himself flip flops, and he bought a shirt from Aeropostale. yea...Then went to Auntie Aunt's for some pretzels. Took those to his house and ate it there. Played some fooseball....hung out...yea it was nice. He took me back to my house so I can go to practice. Then I found out that I didnt have practice..but instead, a game!!! I didnt go to practice yesterday so...yea...and so we lost. Not really worried about it. yea...Anyway...Im getting tired. It's1:25 am right now...so I got class day tomorrow so I need my sleep.</STRONG> </FONT></P>"

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#99ffff>Sunday:</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ffcccc>Woke up at about 10. Got on the computer till like 2. Katy calls me and asks my why Im not ready. Got off the phone with her. Got ready. She came to my house at about 3:15ish. Waited for Kimmie to get over to my house. Kim comes. Me and Katy go to QT to get gas. Met up with Kim at Chansamone's house. Claudia was with them. They go pick Diamona and Lyssy and Katy and I head to Alee's Grad. Party. Got there. Ate. We got bored so we played cards. All of us wanted to bowl. Got out of there at about 7. Ben calls me and ask where I was. He was at Nick's grad party at Cottonwood. We go to Chansamone's house and chilled until it was time to bowl at 10. Ate chips and dip. Karaoked. Im the master at that game! 9 came around. Decided to drive all the way by Altoona to Katelyn Eaton's party. Decided not to go in cause we don't really talk to the girl and Lyssy thinks that Katelyn doesnt really like her anyway. Kim got mad!!! Wasted gas. Headed to Jonny's Birthday party. Drank. A lot of people there...kinda. Ben got there. It was fun. Went to the Bowling alley(a big no no). Couldve had more fun at Johnny's. Didn't feel like bowling cause there was too many people. I just chilled with Ben and watched them bowl. Nick Lange and his&nbsp;family was there...right next to our lane. Kewl. Headed back to Jonny's house at about 12:30 am. Ben had to leave cause of curfew...=*(&nbsp;&nbsp; Stayed at Jonny's for about an hour. Left cause Kimmie was feeling tired. And yep, that was my day!</FONT></STRONG></P>"

I don't think that I have ever been put first. People just like to play with my emotions and I want that to stop. I can't take it anymore. My life already sux. No one wants to do anything with me. I'm just some boring person that no one wants to be with. Everyone has lost interested in me. Some person in my life called me self-centered. Thanks a lot. I hope not to hear from that person ever again. That'll make him/her happy. I'll just stay away from him/her so that person can be happy and don't have to put up with me.</STRONG> </FONT></P>"

Only 2 more days left. It's crazy...Last night, I went to watch the Hoover and North game. Had to pay 6 bucks! gesh...crazy...anyway....I thought for sure that Hoover would win but...they lost. The went into overtime 2wice and then it was the PK shootout. Yea...we all loved Bennie's kick. Like I told Cassi, it was goin to be a kick like a bullet. And yep, it was. I was with Randy, Cassi, Dusty, and Silvia. Afterwards, we watched East get killed by Dowling. I think that whole North and Hoover game stunk. Hoover should've continued. O well...at least Ben wasnt taking it as hard as I thought he would. *sigh*....Im stressing over about the stupid invitations. I want to try to get it done by Friday so I can hand them out but I dont know if that's going to happen. Stupid parents...they are so slow.

Here's the story...I think he was either at Lincoln or by Lincoln and someone(an asian kid)&nbsp;flicked him off and then Fungus flicked him off again and then the&nbsp;guy flicked him off again. And so they got out of their car. Fungus had a wrench in his car and nearly beated up the guy to death with the wrench. So now he's yea...in really big trouble...And since he's 19, he's even in more bigger trouble. I feel bad for the boy. I just remembered him in my English class last year and Jt always made fun of him because he had a lil rat tail. Anyway...I dont feel like playing tonight. Im never in the mood to play anymore. All the things goin on in my life is just killing me. Well, ttyl...</FONT></STRONG></P>"

Ben seemed pretty mad and impatient for some reason. I felt bad. The whole time, I was hoping for the program to go fast so that he can go look for his sister something for her birthday sometime. I kno that he was bored out of his mind cause i kno that i was! I didnt kno that Mr. Cason graduated from East High. That was awesome to see him there. And i never noticed that he had an accent! Which was even weirder!!! </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc33cc>Yea...its raining right now. After the banquet, i was horrifed that it was raining! Gosh, i wonder what was wrong with Ben tonight???!?! He was so mean...kinda. Was&nbsp;it because my pants was too wrinkled for him? Or was it that I didnt look decent enough?? Whatever it was, I felt pretty down.I just felt ugly... =(&nbsp;&nbsp; Im so stuffed up. I couldnt even enjoy my dinner. The whole time at the Banquet, I was just feelin bad for Ben cause I knew that he would be so bored and I wasted his time. I need to pay for my senior breakfast pretty soon or else there will be no more tickets left. Only 12 more days of school left. Wow...its so amazing. Katy L. wants me to go to Nick Lovan's graduation party that she got invited to?? I dont kno who he is but i guess he goes to Hoover. I guess her parents are making her go to it so she wants me to come along. *sigh* I don't feel so good. I feel like whenever I bring Ben along to anything, he seems to be impatient with me or he gives me the vibe that he doesn't want to be here. He says that he doesnt feel good. Maybe that's true but i feel like hes lying to me. Maybe I shouldn't invite him to any of my occasions anymore. *sigh* well, I have nothing else to say so Ill talk to u later.</FONT></STRONG></P>"

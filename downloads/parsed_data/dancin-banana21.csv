"event","Yesterday was a most excellent day.  I woke up and had a twinkie for breakfast.  When I got into work my mentor, Andrew, handed me a huge stack of readings and then said he wouldnt be back in until 3 and I can read those or whatev.  So the work day was as boring as usual but at least I didnt have to hang out with him and play risk.  I hung out at the library and picked up my pay check.  After work, I ate some ice cream and then I went to the beach (even though it was cold and overcast).  Emily and I went swimming and I taught her how to body surf (or at least I tried).  The water was nice because it was warmer than the air but there was way too much sea weed and I kept getting tangled up in it.  Afterwards, I took a shower and when I got out Zaureen and Christina came walking in with a beef and pepperoni pizza.  I was excellent and it only cost $3.99.  After dinner I got to talk to Marni which made me feel elated.  I ended the night by finding out that I can go see the strangers with candy movie next weekend.  YAY!!  Then I snuggled with bunny and fell asleep even though Christina was rambling about more of her life stories.  My she is a loud one."

4.  I like red pandas because they are like a raccoon fox.

"event","so remember that time that we sat on your couch for hours and watched back to back to back to back episodes of the dodgeball tournament?  i remember that day fondly and ever since that day i had secretly wanted to be on a dodgeball team and play in a tournament of my very own.  well yesterday i did.  thats right.  lets go through a little back story.

my cousin rayray died by falling off a rollercoaster and breaking every bone in his body. boop. dead. then, little steph was so distraught about it that she got a job housesitting and moved out.  saturday Lev moved in.  hes the new guy.  very cool dude.  26 fresh outta law school. possibly gay. blah blah blah.  thats the back story.  

now back to the dodgeball story.  so sunday morning we are trying to scrounge together a dodgeball team.  we being me, margaret and caitlin.  we had made shirts already with a picture of mao on them and our team slogan, ""mao is my homeboy.""  all we needed was two more players.  jenny said she would. and then i asked lev.  i wasnt sure if he was comfortable with us enough yet to trust our ball handling abilities but i thought id give it a shot.  i asked and he agreed to be on the team.  he was super excited about it.  it was awesome.  anywho, then jenny and caitlin both dropped out and we were back to only having 3 players.  we went to school early and heckled some ladies in the gym and they joined our awesome crew.  we went undefeated until he championship game.  let me set the scene.  i was the last one in and they had 4 left.  i knocked out two and then got hit right in the foot.  that was the scene.  we lost but we had a better record so its all good.  after the tournament, lev took me and margaret out for ice cream at the baskin robins.  

i think i am going to keep him."

"event","I feel like today I officially earned my awesomely ghetto oaklander card.  It was a very exciting day.  I woke up.  Poked my drunken housemate and then sat around eating the Chuck Norris birthday cake and the last bit of the Osama birthday cake that Caitlin made last night.  Then I took a shower and went to About Face in Rockridge for a little bit of the stuff they are known for.  I came home and was sad to see that Ryan's ipod was still dead.  I checked the craigslist and found this sketchy dude that was selling a black 60gb video ipod.  I met him in the parking lot of the KFC in Lakeshore he told me the ipod was hot about 5 times and he asked me if I was an undercover cop.  I assured that him i was not a cop and i wrote him a check for the thing.  Then Jenny and I drove around Oakland for a little while blasting the gansta rap from my newly acquired stolen ipod.  It was pretty fuckin sweet.  

I also went to the ACE hardware yesterday and got an illegal copy of a key that said ""Do Not Duplicate"" on it.  The guy at the store began explaining to me the legal ramifications of making copies of keys that say ""Do Not Duplicate"" and he was saying all of this while pointing to the sign that said ""We do not duplicate 'Do Not Duplicate' keys"".  The best part was that he was talking and point and blabbering on while he was still making me a copy of the key.  He didnt even ask what the key want to or if it was even my key.  And it wasnt my key.  It was the key that goes to room 4 in the music building (thats the room that has all the fancy Gamelan ensemble and Kongolese drumming equipment).  Let the theft begin.  Just kidding . . . or am I.  I love the ease of illegality in this city.  Im gonna go boost some car stereos and mug a homeless man.  Ill be back later.

I no longer want to play catch up with your life by chasing an internet trail through your myspace/facebook/livejournal friends/AIM away messages.  We all have phones and I am fairly certain that we all know how to use them.  If I remember correctly, there was even a big fight over the break about someone not putting forth any energy to get in touch with her ""best buddies"".  I am not saying that I am not to blame here too.  Im just as bad when it comes to keeping connections with people. I didn't even know that shannon was in DC right now.  Did you?  
The point is that this right here is the reason why everyone had so much trouble over break.  You cant go for 4 months without talking to someone and expect them to return and have everything be alright.  All im saying is that maybe you should call me.  I think you guys know who you are."

You walk home in the rain and do your homework in the rain.  You fall asleep to the soft patter of raindrops on your newly insulated windows.  I think my favorite thing about it being this rainy is taking morning showers.  My hair is wet when I leave my house in the morning and it never dries off.  I love wet hair.  Sometimes I even stick my head in the sink just to wet my hair because it feels so damn good.  My only wish now is that my classes could be outdoors.  I would really like some water proof notebooks and a water proof computer.  I want to be able to sit outside in the rain and still be on my laptop.  The rain forces me to actually do my work inside which i hate.  Doing homework in a computer lab makes me want to grab this computer monitor and throw it through the window.  Maybe even the keyboard too.  I want to be outside right now but I get the feeling that my homework papers wouldnt like that too much.  My new goals in life: invent waterproof notebook paper and waterproof laptops.  Oh December."

I saw veruca salt.  they were pretty bad ass and i was pretty into it.  i am bummed out about my friends back home being losers and not seeing veruca salt at the key club.  apparently they all had to go see harry potter or some shit like that.  (like harry is better then veruca.  i dont think so)  I got invited to a showing of harry potter the day that it came out.  he bought me dinner and i didnt have to pay for the movie ticket.  pretty damn sweet, i know.  last weekend i went with caitlin to petaluma and she got 2 new tattoos.  i wanted to get my ears pierced but the piercer was a douche.  he told me that i was wasting his time and my own money and that i should just go get it done at the mall.  what a douche.  DOUCHE!  anywho.  went al that way just to see caitlin's collar bones.  it was still worth it.  fast forward to this weekend.  

wwwwoooooooosssshhhhhh! (that is the sound of fast forwarding while spinning around really fast)

i would have to say that this weekend was only worth the drive because i got pie.  by the way, pauline's frozen pie thawed on the way home and leaked pumpkin juice all over the back seat of nikki's car.  oops.  anywho, hypatia left her hat at my house on wednesday along with a whole case of beer.  that makes it mine now.  if only i liked beer.  damn taste buds.  took 2 trips to the bevmo and still didnt get anything for myself.  what was i thinking?  oh well.  im sure that in 2 weeks there will be more chances to get stuff from the bevmo.  left my giant cookie goodness and that last slice of awesome pizza in my fridge in LA.  kind of a bummer.  wishing i could type in somewhat coherent sentences.  blah.  i liked the party at my house that just randomly emerged on saturday.  that was kind of nice.  we should do more of that only without all those lube comments from my dad. that man is out of line.  

but now i get to what marni wants to know.  well marni, you want to know if ryan and i had sex this weekend.  here are some things to consider:
--we did spend 77 hours together where the only breaks were for showers and taking poos
--my sexual experiences/ his sexual experiences
--we were both sober all weekend
--your aunt and uncle were in my room all weekend
--we have only been dating for like 3 weeks or so
now you can come to your own conclusions about what happened this weekend.  if you still want to know . . . ask someone else

would you rather:
have to type everything while wearing mittens
 -- OR --
be marni

things to consider:
writing a paper for class, chatting on the aim, being half a karny (or just any part of a karny in general)"

"event","So now that I have officially come down from my cookie and chorizo high I have become sane enough to attempt an update.  I am pretty excited right now because tonight I am going to San Fran to see Veruca Salt.  I think I am more excited about it only being $15 and actually being at an all ages club.  WOOH!  I know that you are all jealous right now but no worries for those of you back home.  You can go see them too.  They are playing at the Key Club on Friday.  GO THERE!  All of you.  Then we can all take notes and have a mass comparison of the two shows.  I think this officially makes me a huge dork.  Oh well.  I know you love it.  peace out."

"event","So more than a few occasions Jenny and I have been pleasantly awoken by the smell of chorizo.  We'll get up and get all excited about the presence of questionable meat in our kitchen.  Then we open the door to find that it is Adrianne making soyrizo.  Thats right SOYRIZO.  Thats soy that has been seasoned and formed to look like chorizo.  YUCK!  For the past month or so I have been craving chorizo and this has just been cruel and unusual treatment.  So, Jenny and I finally got off of our lazy asses and went to Safeway where we bought some of our very own chorizo.  This morning (or I guess it was actually afternoon) Jenny and I decided to have a chorizo party.  At first we thought that we should rub it all over our bodies and dance naked in the streets but that could have gotten us arrested.  So, instead we cooked it with some eggs and we made chorizo and egg tacos (only mine was really a burrito).  For about an hour (both before and after eating the chorizo) I had a happy dance going.  I'd actually like to call it a ""i got chorizo"" dance.  Why is questionable meat from a nearly unknown origin so amazingly good.

(note: chorizo is made up of pig salivary glands, lymph nodes, tongue, cheeks and fat.  basically its pig face.  mmm pig face.)"

"event","Hey there to everyone that reads this crap.  I thought a little update might be kind of nice for all of y'all.  Lately I have been on this kick to find new friends that dont go to Mills.  I want to meet more people that live outside of the Mills social network and preferably arnt female because we all know that I get enough of those.  Thus far I have only met 2 people and one was a really creepy 40 year old man that was way too eager to meet.  The other seems cool enough but I wont go into details now.  I am excited about making a few new friends and I am feeling pretty good about myself right now.  Tomorrow is the last soccer game of the season and we will probably get our asses kicked but afterwords I get to go party with Hypatia (and Jenny does too).  Im excited because she is going to be Garth and I am going to be Wayne.  Arnt we the coolest.  I still want to be Marilyn for halloween but at this point I have kind of given up on it for this year.  Perhaps next year when I have more money and a white dress.  I dont feel so injured anymore but I am totally getting sick but thats cool because I would rather had a cold than a gimped walk.  Things seem like they are going pretty well and now that soccer is done I can spend more time actually doing homework and hanging out with friends.  Im pretty excited about life right now.  I think I am coming down to LA around thanksgiving so maybe Ill get to hang out with y'all then.  Im gonna go crash now.  (God dammit Jenny has me using ""y'all"" stupid texans)"

"event","So I have a huge organic chemistry midterm tomorrow and I really dont feel like studying so I thought I would update.  I have really mixed feelings about life right now.  Take for example soccer season:  I have two games and one practice left.  I am sad that the season will be over soon but at the same time I am really looking forward to getting enough sleep and letting my body not be broken.  I hurt a lot right now but in the back of my head there is this voice saying ""suck it up. theres only 4 days left and then you can be a wimp.""  I have had people around me tell me that what I do to my body is harmful so why dont I ever listen.  If in 19+ years of experience I have learned only one thing it is this: The things you love the most will always hurt you and when you love them back, you let them.  Its as simple as that.  I think that is where all of this mixed feeling business comes from.  Time to go back to being emotionless.  Oh Apathy, how I love thee."

"event","So this morning I remembered the main reason why I live up here.  Basically I woke up and didn't want to get out of bed because it was ridiculously cold.  I finally forced myself to get up and do something because Caitlin was making way too much noise.  I ate breakfast and got dressed.  I had the intentions of sitting around for a while and then driving to school.  Then, I walked outside and say the giant, dense layer of fog.  Seeing the lovely mist over all of the cars inspired me to walk to school.  So I did (no big feat since I live all of 4 blocks away).  It was pretty damn refreshing and an awesome way to start my day.  I had forgotten how much i love the fog.  anywho . . . that wasnt meant to be the focus of today's entry.

The rest of today's entry will be about the amazing dance parties that will be going on at my house this semester:
  The first party is going to be a drunken naked pizza dance party.  This basically means that the 6 of us are going to get slobbering drunk and dance around naked.  Then we are going to call for the ""man fuel"" pizza.  When that delivery man comes to the door we are going to open the door (still dancing and naked) and pull him inside to join us.  
  The second dance party will be the one that makes us enough money to pay rent for ever and not have to work.  For this one we are only inviting people with epilepsy.  Thats right, epilepsy.  The plan is get close to a dozen of them, put them in our living room, turn on the black light and start taping.  Hopefully they will all have fits and with the black light it will look like a really awesome rave.  Then we will spray them down with a hose and sell copies ont he internet.  It seems pretty failsafe.  We are gonna make millions.

Also . . . here is what I learned today.  Africa is a soft, fluffy pastry.  It has a yummy crunchy candy topping but the cream filling is really gross.  ITS OVER!"

""The Last Song""
by Foo Fighters

This is the sound
The here and the now
You got to talk the talk, the talk, the talk
To get it all out

I listen
I listen
I listen

But you're out of tune
You're so out of tune

This is the last song (This is the last song)
This is the last song
That I will dedicate to you

Something I've found
Yea, That want to turn around
You got to walk the walk, the walk, the walk
To make any ground

You're pushing
You're pushing
You're pushing

But there ain't no room
No there ain't no room

This is The last song (This is the last song)
This is the last song (This is the last song)
That I will dedicate to you
I made my peace
And now I'm trough
This is the last song
That I will dedicate to you

And yours is a name
I will never name again
I will never name again

We pretend it doesn't matter
We pretend it all away
We pretend it all away

We pretend
We pretend
We pretend

But it ain't no use
This is the last song (This is the last song)
This is the last song (This is the last song)
That I will dedicate to you
I made my peace
And now I'm through

This is the last song
That I will dedicate to you"

I am slowly climbing out of the shit hole that i got stuck in.

I am enrolling in this government program that will allow the government to pay me to get my car fixed enough to pass a smog check.  My knee is swollen but it will go away.  I think that for halloween I am going to dye my hair blond and be marilyn monroe.  I should start getting paid for my job soon.  I have also completed almost all of my transfer applications and i am hoping that by next fall I wont be going to this ridiculous school anymore.  I want to go to a real college."

I am a little bit bummed that the game is so late because that means that I cant go to the Toast Machine show at the Phoenix.  kind of a bummer but i think i can deal with it because ive seen them like 4 times already and i dont have enough money for the show and bridge toll.  I think on Saturday Ill take Mike over to Fisherman's Wharf and we can get some clam chowder.  Yummy $2 chowder in a bread bowl.  I cant wait.

"event","So this weekend was pretty fucking awesome.  Friday went really well when the mills cyclone soccer team won their first game of the season (it was 7-0).  And then i went home and realized just how crazy my mother had become.  So get this, I come home friday night pretty late and find that the only piece of furniture left in my room was my bed and that all of my shit was in boxes.  That was pretty exciting.  So Friday night Mike spent the night and I was really surprised that my dad asked me not only ""why is mike sleeping on the floor instead of being in your bed?"" but also ""dont you guys want the door closed?""  I was shocked because I have always lived under the rule that i am not aloud to be with a boy in my room with the door closed.  Needless to say I was pretty excited about it.  Then on Saturday my dad made a really great breakfast for me, mike, jenny and my brother and then we went to san bernardino for the inland invasion 2005.  I was pretty rockin.  We got there while the bravery was playing and luckily for us they got their asses off the stage right as we got to the lawn.  Then, the arcade fire came on and i pretty much had the most orgasmic one person dance party of my life.  They rocked it.  Then Live came out and i sat down (and i surprised myself with the knowledge of their lyrics ""her placenta falls to the floor""? what the fuck is that?)  Anywho, post christian rock there was Garbage and Jenny and I both decided that if we were gay we would both want to hit it with Shirley Manson.  She was pretty god damn hot.  After that was Jet who pretty much put me to sleep.  There was another dance party when Madness came out because they were pretty much the definition of skapunkrastafunk.  311 was pretty cool but oddly enough there was moshing.  Right because when i think 311 i think mosh pit.  Beck came out after that and he was pretty awesome.  These guys came out with a kitchen table and some dishware and started playing the dishware with spoons and knives.  There was also this random guy That was pretty sweet.  Then weezer came out and they were pretty predictable so I wasnt really feeling it.  Oasis came out and as much as i love Oasis they could have been a lot better.  They wernt that excited to be there so i kinda wasnt that excited to watch them.  Then Cake finished the whole show and I remembered just why I love them.  Oh yeah its because they rock.  The whole time they were on stage the lead singer was bitching about randomness and talking about how they arnt professional because they dont have a playlist.  Then he started taking band member requests and audience requests.  That was pretty cool.  Then i got back home and mike spent the night again.  then on sunday i went out to breakfast with jenny, marni and kimi.  That was some pretty good eatin for 5 bucks.  Then i got home pretty late and did some homework.  Good times all around.  Oh yeah and I have a car now.  HOORAY!  Now that I have realized that I have no concept of paragraphs or sentence structure I think ill go do homework.  Oh yeah and good news . . . I have internet at my house now.  HOORAY! HOORAY! HOORAY!"

"event","So today I devoted my time to doing a bunch of random shit.  Stephanie woke me up this morning to go to the farmers market in Montclair.  Basically it is a place where a bunch of random farmers sell their organic produce for pretty damn cheap.  While we were there we ran in to our soccer coach and the volleyball coach.  They congratulated us on buying healthy organic foods and I felt special.  Stephanie and I also talked to a baker who was there and he convinced us to buy this triple chocolate raspberry cake.  It was really expensive but the orgasm was well worth it.  

After that I went with Jenny, Caitlin, Stephanie and her grandma to church over near Lake Merritt.  We ended up getting there late and had to stand in the back.  Almost the whole time I was standing next to this row of short columns that had on them large glass bottles of colored liquids and I kept losing my balance and falling into the columns.  I had this huge fear that I would push over one column and all of the glass would shatter spilling the sacred oils everywhere.  Luckily I convinced Jenny to switch places with me and then Caitlin rubbed my thigh for a while.  Oh yeah, and I should probably mention that this was a very gay church so no one really cared that Caitlin was caressing my thigh while my hand was in her pocket.  I also decided that the next time I walk into a church I should yell ""God is dead and Satan will reign supreme forever"" in latin and then projectile vomit pea soup onto the crucifix.  That would be fun.

So, after church we went to china town in San Francisco for the moon festival.  There were a ton of food stands that were there only for the purpose of handing out free samples.  That was pretty sweet.  The streets were really fucking crowded and the shops were pretty shitty but it was fun anyways.  After we left we stopped at the East Bay Vivarium in Berkeley which is my favorite reptile place ever.  I stared and some snakes, bought some crickets and then went home.

When I got home I made dinner for everyone because it was my turn to make the house hold sunday dinner.  I made pasta with a chunky vegetarian marinara sauce, italian sausages stuffed with sun-dried tomatoes and a spinach salad with feta cheese, tomatoes and cucumber.  (I really should learn to tell the difference between cucumber and zucchini)  Then we all ate the orgasmic chocolate cake from the farmer's market and spent the rest of the evening cleaning the house.  Good times all around I'd say.

All in all I would say that this was my most productive non school day that I have had since I have come back up here.  This is how every sunday should be (only the religion doesnt need to be there)."

"event","So I got back from Portland on Saturday and right now I am pretty surprised that I am not sore at all from playing 2 whole games.  I am sore, however, from Caitlin.  I made a crack about her mom's face liking the head of my penis so she pulled me off the couch and jumped on my back.  There was a cracking sound and after assessing the damages I realized that totally cracked one of my ribs.  What a sasquatch!  How much of a fat ass do you have to be to crack someone's rib?  God damn woman!  So anywho, the soccer team lost both of the games in portland by a lot but I think that we played pretty well considering the number of girls on our team that dont even know how to take a kick off or where the left defender is supposed to be.  All in all i would have to say that I had a pretty fun time in oregon especially with the free 1/2 pound hotdogs and the super cheap, on sale, tax free shopping.  I might have to go back there on a winter or summer break road trip with the dude.  That'll be great.  I should start planning that now.

"event","so im back at school again and I have finally gotten everything unpacked and put away.  i had my first day of class yesterday and i think that i will either have a whole lot of fun or the classes will kill me.  either way, we are in for a smashing good time.  im excited because saturday night i get to go see hypatia. shannon and i are going up to chico with a couple of shannons friends and we are going to kidnap hypatia and force her to hang out with us.  it gonna be great.  anywho, we dont have internet at my house yet but it should be here by the end of the month so then i will start updating regularly again.  right now i am using a neighbors wireless connection to do my biddings.  muahahamuahahaha!  well i just got out of the shower and i should really get dressed before my class starts because going to the first class in a bath robe and towel sounds fun but oakland is cold so id rather have pants.  speaking of pants, i think ill go wake up shannon with a kick in the pants."

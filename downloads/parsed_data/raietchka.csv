"event","I'm feeling all troubled again.  Big surprise.  The actual <i>strange</i> thing was yesterday when I wasn't outlandishly moody.  I was uncharacteristically sociable and even felt borderline happy for a couple hours.  Today it's back to the same old stuff.  At least it feels that way.  I should be asleep right now, actually.  I've been exhausted all day.  I seriously can't do normal people hours.  I'll have to go through a serious boot camp to fix my internal clock if I ever get a job.

Ugh.  I think the only way to do things is to live vicariously through fictional characters.  They have fun good times.  Fat girls get caring, hot guys to fall in love with them in books.  Or else they become not fat.  But more often than not they learn some great life lesson by going through a major experience, and they come out on the other side as confident, content people.  If I ever wrote a book, I have a terrible feeling that it'd just end up as a massive whine-fest about how much life sucks.  So basically, it would read like one massive, semi-coherent LiveJournal entry from yours truly.

Meh, I don't think I really have the energy to delve full-force into my neuroses tonight.  More later."

"event","The urge to LJ is overwhelming right now for some reason.  As you might expect, I have nothing remotely exciting to offer.  I'm still jobless and freeloading.  I had an interview at Target today.  That's right, Target.  Where I used to work before I went to grad school two years ago and fucked everything up.  Except this Target is in Sandusky - the hippest place on Earth.  I swear if I don't get this job there I'm going to drink an entire fifth of tequila in one night.  And probably die.  Oh I'm still looking for what I like to call ""a real job"" - which is a terrible thing to say.  It's quite condescending, isn't it?  I should stop saying that.  What I mean is I want a sort of ""professional"" type job.  I believe, however, the big cog in the works is the fact that I'm not certain I actually want to work in the field for which I obtained a master's degree.  And if I did, to get the <i>kind</i> of job I want, I'd pretty much have to get a second master's degree.  But in what, I ask you?  The problem is that I'm interested in too many things.  I could go for a master's in education; but then I think I'd want to be a teacher, right?  How about a master's in linguistics?  That would be pretty interesting, and I've always liked learning languages and phonetics and such.  Or maybe a master's in criminal justice.  That could get me a job somewhere, right?  I find that stuff interesting, too.  I guarantee if I tried even a little I could come up with at least 4 more degree programs I'd be interested in within the next 2 minutes.  Why am I so goddamn indecisive?!  It's beyond frustrating and it's getting me nowhere.  Oh just deliver me a nice sugar daddy, then I could do whatever the hell kind of work I wanted with no shame at all.  Or I could go to school for the rest of my life.  That could be ideal.  And I could have a country house and a beach house.  If only this plan were feasible.

It's getting late.  Later than I thought.  I've had two days of a semi-normal sleep schedule; I should try not to fuck it up.  If I ever do get a job, I'll probably need to be awake earlier than 3:18 p.m., which is how late I slept on Monday.

There's a lot of other stuff I was going to vent.  Maybe tomorrow."

"event","Well, this will seem like randomness to anyone (besides me) who might read this, but I don't care.

I have a random type of memory.  I never seem to remember large events in my life.  I remember silly little things that have happened.  And while a lot of the things I do remember tend to be negative, I occasionally retain positive things.  I was very touched and pleased today to find out that one such little happy thing I remember from high school is remembered by at least one other person.

It's absolutely ridiculous, but in high school, during some particular Latin class or another, I was doing a translation with my group, which consisted of myself and two of my male friends.  I have no idea who initiated the conversation or why, but ultimately they both made a deal with me that if neither of us was married by the time we were 30, we'd marry each other.  I forget who was the first to be my ""backup"" and who was the second, but it doesn't really matter at this point.  I thought certainly they both would've forgotten about our goofy high school ""deal"", but today (well, yesterday technically) one of them mentioned it.  As dumb as it is, that meant so much to me that I can't even put it into words.  Alas, both of my backups are now married themselves.  But I'm supremely touched that either of them remembered, even if it was only just the one guy.

Ah memories.

This stupid little internet-based reminder of that time has given me a ray of sunshine in my life today.  And I really am in need of those a lot lately.

The end for now."

"event","It's been a while, my friend.  And with good reason; nothing is happening in my life.  I have received a few more rejection letters from jobs I had (forgotten that I) applied for.  That's always good.  I do love rejection.  I did, however, have a phone interview on Tuesday.  I'm not sure how it went, frankly.  I'm sensing rejection, mostly because I don't have experience in a lot of the specific areas they want experience.  But who knows?  Maybe they only had a handful of applicants - which I doubt.  Either way it won't break my heart since my heart's not really in the hunt for a library job.  I'm a silly, fickle girl, I know.  Whatevs.  I did apply for a couple jobs with the state.  I'm going to keep my eyes open for further openings there, because those state bennies are hot shit.  So we'll see.

What else what else?  Pretty much nothing.  I've been quite moody and am rapidly finding it nearly unbearable to live with my parents, especially my dad; but that was to be expected, I do believe.  I'm sure there are productive or at least helpful things I could and should be doing, but I rarely (if ever) find the motivation.  I'm mostly a waste, spending my days watching <i>Law & Order</i> and other quality programming.

"event","So not that today was terribly taxing, but the a/c was broken and/or just not on in the library all night.  And the windows don't open.  It had to be 85 degrees in there.  So I sat there and just got more and more tired as the night went on.  You know how being warm does that.  I got home and took a quick run through the shower - not my thorough routine, but a clean up so I didn't feel totally disgusting.  I should've just brushed my teeth then, because I was still exhausted and nearly falling asleep.  Well I sat here and fucked around online for a while, then decided I should try to sleep.  Wouldn't you know, as soon as I turned off the lights and rolled over, my mind started going a mile a minute like it tends to do.  So I'm not asleep now.  Instead, I'm writing a goddamn LJ entry.

The things I think about 98% of the time are ridiculous and childish.  At least in one way or another.

--insert 45-minute break due to phone call with Paul--

So yes, I was on about the things my brain churns through while I'm trying to sleep and at other times.  These thoughts range from memories to fantasies; from depressing to mundane to joyful.  I don't know why the brain does these things.  Like I'll lie there, and one minute I'm thinking about some semi-drunken fun time I had a few years ago.  Then a second later I'll be lying there thinking how nice it would be to have someone lying next to me, holding me.  At first the person will be faceless, then I'll start to imagine people I know - which takes the thought process down a whole other route.  Everything about me is just so fucked lately.  My moods are all over the place, my cycle has been wacky, and most recently I've been having issues with sleeping.  I don't know what to do with myself.  I don't know if these things are happening because my life/living situation is going to be changing drastically again in the near future, or because my life is so fucking boring, or because I have some chemical/hormonal imbalance, or some other unknown factor(s).  Why do I even contemplate all these things?  I'm certainly not going to come up with the brilliant answer tonight.

I think I'm semi-secretly miserable about my career, too.  I feel like I'm realizing more and more that I don't want to be a librarian - unless I can be <i>strictly</i> a cataloger and not have to deal with other people (and then only maybe) - but also that I have no fucking clue what I'd actually want to do.  I don't know what would make me happy in life.  And I feel more and more like I've completely given up and resigned myself to utter mediocrity for all eternity.  And continuing that train of thought, I don't really see a point in living.  But I'm also scared of dying.  So let's not call the suicide hotlines just yet.  The asinine hope that something good will eventually happen may be the only thing that keeps me going - but it only keeps me functioning at a minimal level.

So what is to be done?  Nothing, really.  At least nothing I can think of.  I have no motivation to better myself because I'm literally incapable of being realistically positive about life.  I can't picture things changing phenomenally for the better by any means.  So I've got a ""what's the point?"" attitude about everything.  What's that called?  Being a fatalist?  Or is it a nihilist?  Who gives a fuck.  Let's just call it hopeless.

Oh and this is the other thing that happens to me at night.  I go from simply ""running my mind all the time"" to fucking pensive/morose/melancholy/morbid.

Dude.  Buckets full of crazy over here.

Maybe I'll try this whole sleeping venture again."

"event","It's only been about a decade, LiveJournal, but your time has come again.  I've been using a non-digital (gasp!) journal lately.  Yes, I know, paper is no longer in vogue for the kids, but fuck it.  Tonight, however, I don't feel like writing again, because it makes my hand hurt after a couple pages.  And so I turn to you.

There's a lot of stuff on my mind, but I'll try to be as clear as possible here.  First off - well, and secondly too, I guess - is the job thing.  Now don't get me wrong here.  I think it's pretty rockin' that the internship I actually <i>enjoyed</i> during my master's program ended up presenting a job opportunity.  And I very much like (most of) the people I work with in that place.  But, really, the job is not what I was ultimately hoping for.  Then again, I don't think the master's I now have is exactly what I was hoping for.  The thing is, I was desperate for a change of pace, change of location (so I thought), change of life (so I thought).  Oh silly, silly girl.  The funny thing is that I thought that would actually work.  I really had convinced myself it would do the trick and be the magical fix for everything I thought was subpar/wrong in my life.  Welp, we sure know better now don't we.  And that's fine.  I chalk that up to one more lesson learned.  So fuck it, the last ~2 years were a mistake in the game plan.  Whatever.  And I've begun rambling.

The point I started out to make for the ""first off"" and ""secondly"" was that this part-time, 33-week position will not cut it for my livelihood.  It's barely cutting it as a short-term solution for resume building and career springboard-ing.  So, no, I don't think it'd be wise to continue there after this semester is over.  And as the ""secondly"" portion: even if I (or my boss) knew all the details about the 	<i>possible</i>, temporary, summer session employment that would most likely pay even less than I'm making in my current, part-time, 33-week position, I'm still pretty sure I wouldn't go for it.  Despite my ridiculous urge to please and fear/guilt about disappointing others.  So I'd <i>maybe</i> get some more cataloging experience?  Would that be worth dealing with a former ""mentor"" who apparently thinks I'm a fuckwit who needs to be spoon fed every new tidbit of cataloging knowledge?  Would it be worth continuing in a position that I don't find the least bit satisfying?  I'm gonna go with a resounding ""no"" on each one of those.

So, as ambivalent as I am about the decision, I think the wisest choice would be, in fact, to move back in with my parents over the summer - and, yes, perhaps longer-term than that - while I continue to send out resumes and foolishly hope that I'll find a full-time professional position somewhere.  I know it'll be nearly unbearable at times.  But financially and otherwise, it seems like the most helpful option.  Oh I'll get some menial (or better...?) job while I'm living there.  I can't justify being a shiftless layabout who spends every fucking day shuffling around the house with the two ultimate dogs who reside there.  It's with a great deal of reluctance that I make this decision.  But something has to be done.  And I think this is it.

And now as to that other large problem I'm having.  Well, I just don't know where to begin.  I'm pretty sure that I'm totally fooling myself (and fucking myself over in the head) to think that a certain feeling is there.  Frankly, I just haven't figured it out yet.  And I don't know who to talk to about it.  The number of parties available for unbiased consultation is limited.  And I really don't want to annoy the awesome girls at work with my bullshit craziness.  But the way these thoughts have been plaguing me as of late, I have to get them out somehow.  And I'd really rather not use any of my traditional methods.  Frankly, the self-destruction thing is getting rather tired.  But, even despite my frequent writing lately, the sense of being emotionally overwhelmed is growing.  And neither screaming, nor loud music, nor distracting myself with movies has remedied the state of mind in question.  Undoubtedly, I'm headed down that lame, self-pitying road of douchebaggery again.  Too bad I haven't developed any sort of willpower lately.

On the plus side (crazy, I know), the road trip last week was fucking awesome.  Excellent sites were seen, wonderful times were had, and great company was enjoyed.  More events like that in the future would be a good thing, but I fear the impending doom of adulthood will hinder any sort of future random road trips.  So at least I have some pictures to show for it.  And the memories, of course, but we know how those can be fleeting; the only memories I seem to retain long-term are the bad ones.  Oh, brain, you can just eat my ass.

All right, LiveJournal, I hope you've enjoyed this little chat.  I almost feel slightly better.  But I'm sure we'll see you again soon."

"event","Well I'm sad for no known reason.  I feel a wave of melancholy washing over me.  I don't know if it's something missing, or what.  Actually, I think that's exactly the problem.  I should be feeling relatively happy, since I got an unofficial part-time job offer.  But the job isn't really what I want to do or where I want to be.  The job is at one of the libraries where I'm currently interning.  I do like the people I work with there.  I like the project I'm working on for my internship.  And they're basically adapting the job description to fit what I am interested in doing.  I should be really happy about this, right?

Perhaps this is partly to do with the impending birthday.  It's not a meaningful birthday, by any means.  I feel shitty and unhappy.  Yes, things are missing, and I know what at least a few of them are.

I went for a walk this afternoon.  Generally throughout the walk I was pretty happy ... dogs were playing in the park, the sun was shining, and so on.  Then when I was almost home, I saw something that almost made me cry.  I actually had to focus so I didn't start crying.  And though the idea of this makes me want to mock myself, I can't help it.  This little scene just slapped me in the face with something I've been missing for a long time.

Instead, I kept on reading the book I picked up at the library on Tuesday (yesterday?!) and I went ahead and finished it a little while ago.  So now I'm trying to sleep and I can't turn off my brain.  This happens sometimes.  I have to get up at 7 tomorrow morning (a.k.a. 6 hours from now), so I'm trying to force myself to sleep, which <i>always</i> works.

So many things are running through my brain right now.  I'm starting my second internship tomorrow.  I'm not very excited about it, primarily - if not solely - because of all the b.s. administrative problems I've had in getting started.  Yesterday, for shits and giggles, I figured out how many days until commencement ... 80 as of today.  That's not very much time.  I have to put in 150 hours at this place before then - probably well before then.  I also have to start looking (harder) for a job.  I have to figure out what I want to do <i>with my life</i>.  In 80 days.  I'm going to be 26 less than four weeks from now.  I haven't accomplished anything.  And I haven't even had all those romantic, character building trials and tribulations.  No great love affairs.  No casual sex.  I haven't written a novel, or even any really intriguing papers.  I haven't read enough.  I've seen too many movies.  I've missed out on concerts, conferences, festivals.  What the fuck have I been doing all these years?  I haven't travelled to 98% of the places I want to see.  I haven't told people I love them enough.  I haven't hugged people enough.  I've spent so much time worrying about what people would think that I haven't done what I've <i>felt</i> I should do.

How will anyone ever deal with a person this neurotic?  Is it ridiculous to hold onto childish dreams in the back of my mind (or more likely in the front)?  I want the comfort and company of a person I can tell anything without fear of judgment.  Do most people have that?  Maybe I've had it before and I've lost it.  Maybe I still have it and I don't realize it.  I imagine it as the feeling of a warm blanket on a cold night; a warm body in an otherwise empty bed.  Fuck you, yes I write in cliches.  No wonder all I've wanted to listen to for days on end is Radiohead and Modest Mouse.

So I'm not really sure what the point of having health insurance is if they <i>don't pay for fucking anything</i>.  After my uncle harped on me for an entire weekend about my severely sprained ankle being probably broken, I went to the ER for x-rays.  So today I get a call from the hospital, saying my insurance paid some measly amount like $50 or something, and that I owe a balance of something like $500.  Well, fuck you, Anthem (BlueCross Blue Shield).  I haven't been to a doctor/hospital/anything in fucking years, the whole time paying for your overpriced bullshit health insurance, so now when I finally have a theoretical need for it, I'm stuck forking over more money to the racket that is the US medical industry.

There are probably ways of fighting this directly with the insurance company, but who has the time to deal with that bullshit?  Plus they're open about as much as banks, so while I'm doing internships and school, how the hell would I find time between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Eastern Time to call them up so they can put me on hold and jerk me off for an hour or two?

P.S. Eric is not dead (thank god!!!); I talked to him today for about 45 minutes, which was really fun.  So that's one thing off my mind ... sort of.  I hope he gets better and out of the hospital soon.  Okay that's enough for you 3 public/friends-type readers."

"event","Oh man I can't sleep tonight.  Yes, I'm prone to bouts of ridiculous worrying, but I feel my worry is more justified this time.  First of all, I'm worried about Eric.  He's been in the hospital for like a week and a half now, and I tried calling the direct line to his room a couple times this weekend to no avail.  So tomorrow I""m calling the hospital's main line to find out what (if anything) they can tell me.  I'm also now worried about where I'm going to live during the Fall semester.  I talked to the property manager today, and he said they simply don't do month-by-month leases, and there's no way they'll give me a 5-month lease, so I either have to find a new place to stay or find someone who's looking to sublet this place and execute a move in upstate New York in the dead of winter ... because that's plausible.  So, as it turns out, getting my degree in an efficient manner is causing logistical and potentially financial problems.  We'll see what craigslist can do for me.  I don't know what else I'm worrying about.  Well, actually, I'm supposed to be meeting some person for coffee on Wednesday, so I'm anxious about that.  As if ...

I took some OTC sleep aid bullshit that I had lying around, so hopefully those will kick in soon.  For now, I guess I'll try to read some more, since it seems no other creeps are up to talk to me at this hour."

"event","<lj-cut text=""sporadic insomnia"">Well I'm definitely having trouble sleeping tonight.  I was wiped out from this sickness all day today, and yet I can't rest.  I think I set myself off.  I started obsessively reading all the news I could about the tragedy at Virginia Tech yesterday.  I don't know anyone who goes there, in fact, I don't think I know anyone in the entire state of Virginia; but I couldn't stop reading about it.  So I don't know if that got my wheels permanently turning for the night or what.  Anyhow, awake I am, and it's after 2:30 a.m.

So as I've been lying here, trying to sleep, the mind wanders from subject to subject.  I've had a Matthew Sweet (love him!) song stuck in my head for at least 2 days, but I don't have it on iTunes, and I don't feel like rummaging around for the <i>Can't Hardly Wait</i> soundtrack album which holds said song.  So there's that.  Then I start fretting over my final presentation that's due next Tuesday in my database class and how I seriously have no idea what I'm doing.  That ought to be fun.  I'm going to look like a total jackass.  I blame the teacher for not <i>teaching me anything</i>!  Then I start thinking about how I need to clean my apartment, and when I'm going to have time to do it.  Then I think ""oh, I need to do laundry soon"" and when I'll have time to do that.  Then I start thinking about all the time I waste doing nothing.  I could go on for ages like this, you see.  I know I've talked about it before and recently ... it just happens so often.  Sometimes writing here or in my physical journal (yes, I still have one) helps.  Sometimes reading (a physical book) helps.  Other times I don't know what I do ... just toss around for hours until I finally lapse into sleep, I guess.

I think I've talked to people about my self-diagnosed borderline OCD before.  Well I have this thing with completion/completeness.  Let me present some examples:
1.  I hate not seeing entire movies.  Even if it's god awful, I must watch the whole thing.  Similarly, I hate missing parts (e.g., bathroom breaks at the theater) or even stopping and restarting movies at home.
2.  I can't read partial chapters of books.  Or sections of articles.  I must complete a distinct unit.  There is no room for arbitrariness.
3.  I can't write papers in bits and pieces.  I literally sit down and work for hours on end to start and finish a paper all in one session.
4.  If I start working on a bottle of wine, I almost always have to finish it that night.  This has certainly led to extreme drunkenness on more than one occasion.
5.  If I get hooked on a TV series, I am compelled to watch every single episode ever, from start to finish, and I must do so in the shortest time period possible.

I'll quit there for now.  I'm a big ball of crazy is what it breaks down to.  I should do one LJ a week that focuses strictly on a specific branch of my neurosis.  That may be a bit ambitious at this point.

I know I've said it before, but I really wish I had the capacity to be an amazing poet or novelist.  Like I wish I were someone who could write something that at least somewhat intelligent quasi-adults could enjoy and tell their friends about.  I'm not saying I want Oprah's Book Club status (whatever that may be, as a couple years ago she made a classic Russian novel her book of the month), but somebody fucking sweet like Kurt Vonnegut (RIP), or ""hip"" like David Sedaris (I'll have to qualify him with ""allegedly"" as I've never read any of his stuff), or some author I just like such as Wally Lamb.  Alas, I lack the creative talent and narrative prowess that would be required.  Fuck it ... maybe I should go for a second Master's in English and just work on being a career student - hopefully one who finds a sugar daddy.

I see the rambling kicking in at a higher octane rating, so I'll cut it off for tonight and try sleeping again.

"event","Oh I was going to do up a little entry here, but now I'm not so sure I feel like it.  The weather here has been shit all day.  Literally, a diarrhea of wet snow, sleet, and/or heavy rain has been pouring from the sky's bowels all day long.  So today was my designated not-leaving-the-apartment day.  Hence, I got zero work done.  Which is the exact opposite of what needed to happen.  There are between 3 and 4 weeks left in the semester - which I'm sure I've already bemoaned - and all these final projects are looming on top of other assignments due for classes.  If I've already bitched to you about this, please don't waste your time reading it again.  I just want this semester to be over.  As much as I felt like they were needed, I have decided that breaks in the middle of the semester only make things worse.  Honestly, I'd bet at least 90% of students don't/didn't touch schoolwork over the entirety of either break.  The breaks lull you into a false sense of security, and then BAM! you have a quiz and a couple assignments due during the first week back.  Oh, and you really should've been working on your final projects before now (and then comes the obligatory grimace, or whatever you'd call that face people make while showing their teeth and sucking air in that makes you feel like you're a 12-year-old being scolded for poor decision-making).  --As an aside, don't you guys love my long, drawn-out, parentheses- or hyphen-enclosed descriptions?  I sure like writing them ... they can become so convoluted. --  Anyhow, I'm worrying about school stuff, because I worry like it's my job.  I've been ripping at my cuticles fiercely and with vigor, so that tomorrow my entire fingertips will be gross and scabby ... good thing I've overbought on adhesive bandages and antibiotic ointment my entire life - and never thrown any of it away.  On top of school things, I was attempting an online-based venture at meeting new people, and met with rejection/disappointment in one form or another on two distinct occasions this past week; so that always bodes well.

At least this semester I can say I'm genuinely interested in (most of) the things I'm learning, and not feeling like this curriculum choice was a (complete and inescapable) mistake.  I do still hate the fact that I'm a social retard/outcast, and like always I've found it's much easier to give up and/or resolve to fail than to put any true effort into it.  So you advice-prone kiddies, don't give me the ""why don't you go out for coffee some place interesting?"" or the ""why don't you hit up a bar or club on the weekends?"" or any of that b.s. because the fact of the matter is that I won't do it.  Even if I did, I wouldn't talk to anyone.  Oh and jesus christ, if anyone who knows me had been on that bus from main campus down to bar central a couple Friday nights ago, you'd know why there's no way in hell I will be frequenting any bar where the kids from this school might engage in drunkening and debauchery.

My how we've digressed.  Whatever.  Oh, I'm coming down with some sort of sinus devilry, which couldn't come at a better time, in my opinion.  Nothing like b.s.ing one's way through multiple papers while making the disgusting *snork* noise every 10 seconds ... I probably won't be spending much time in the library, so as to avoid grossing everyone out.  Maybe it only bothers me, but I can't stand hearing <i>my own</i> bodily noises, let alone those of others who are clearly infested with some gross bacteria or virus which is undoubtedly spreading with every sneeze, cough, and blow.  YUCK!

Apparently a case of the rambles also caught on this evening ... who knew?  I should cut it off now so I can get to bed and attempt to get some work done tomorrow.

The end for now.

Actually, P.S. : I'm <i>so</i> glad I live at the top of a hill and not the bottom; this shit be floodin' all over the place!  (Probably not literally, but still, the tire grooves in the street look like little streams.)

<lj-cut text=""bitchery"">all of my final assignments are due within the next 2-4 weeks.  now this may not sound like a short time to most, but 2 of my four classes have assignments due each class meeting in addition to final assignments, and one class i'm semi-lost in because the teacher is not doing a very good job and we don't have a textbook and it blows.  the bottom line is that i'm getting the end-of-semester hyper-stress earlier than anticipated.  my spring break was not very relaxing at all.  in fact, it was sort of ridiculous.  i spent the one weekend in columbus, doing a whirlwind tour attempt to see my friends, which left me feeling spread too thin; then i got up to my parents and did nothing all week.  i got to see them both pretty much just at night when they got home from work (dad around 11:15 [but then dog-walking for about 30-45 minutes], and mom no earlier than 12:15 [but often much later]) because i slept until 11 or 12 pretty much every day.  so it was almost a waste to visit them.  but not really, and i'm not trying to sound like a callous asshole, because i do enjoy spending time with my parents (when my dad's not pissing me off and when my mom's not drunk [neither of which occurs very often]) and seeing the dogs, but otherwise i would've much rather spent some more time with my friends.  then again, ""friends"" seem to be slipping away at an alarming rate in one way or another.  anyway ... my point was that i'm stressed and ready for the semester to be over.  oh additionally, i should be looking for a job, as it looks like i'll be staying here all summer so i can take one 6-week class.  ... yeah.  that blows pretty hard, too.  then again, maybe i won't be able to find a job so i'll be worthless all summer.  i should apply at hollywood video or some bullshit, just in case i can't find a library-related job.  (once again, that was more of an aside to myself.)

whatever.  i skipped the one and only class i'm skipping all semester tonight so i could finish an assignment that's due in another class tomorrow.  it wasn't even to do something cool.  fuck that.

i should probably stop bitching for the sake of all who read (a.k.a. eric and jeannine).

i'm so pissed at life right now.  why to people like that have to exist?  and why couldn't i be brave enough to do something about it?  i'm such an asshole.  but not as big an asshole as that fucking soon-to-be date rapist."

yesterday was a busy day.  it didn't have to be.  if i had been more diligent in getting schoolwork done, i wouldn't have had so much to do yesterday.  but i'm the asshole once again.  i got up at 8, got cleaned up and dressed and all that, walked to my car (which was parked in washington park due to douchey snow emergency), went to the library on the uptown (main) campus to finish an assignment, came back to the downtown campus library to type  up some stuff and finish same said assignment, had an advising appointment at 1, went back to library to finish typing up said assignment and start work on next week's assignment for same class, had class at 4:15 downtown, that class ended at 6:45 (early for once), drove back to uptown campus for class from 7:15 until 9:30 (early for once as well, though not by much), came back home where i ate some soup and checked e-mail and internet things, then went to bed at 11.  now i'm awake at this retarded hour and i'm hungry and sleepy, but i don't want to eat for fear of waking up further, and i can't sleep.  bah.  so much for the run down.

my advising appointment went well i think.  the professor i met with is not actually my advisor, but she's much more accessible and easy to talk with than my actual advisor, so i asked her if she'd see me about classes and stuff.  i know i posted a big long bullshit list of things i was considering for a general summer/fall plan to finish out my degree.  as no one gave me any opinions except jeannine, i felt like i needed further guidance.  this is all necessitated by the fact that i apparently can't make a decision on my own.  so anyway, after talking with dr. andersen yesterday, what i'm thinking is that i'll do two separate 150-hour internships in the fall (one of which counts as a 3-hour elective), i'm looking into taking a graduate-level course in the criminal justice department (as another 3-hour elective), then choosing at least one class offered by my department for the fall, and either a second class in my dept. or an independent study.  and that will round out my master's degree.  the only thing that might be a wild card is that my department is potentially adding one additional course this summer that would be right up my alley, but there's no word on that yet.  if they don't add that class, i'll just do the freeloading off my parents thing all summer, while working somewhere and hopefully doing a pseudo-(or non-pseudo-)internship at a library near sandusky.

sometimes having options is a real issue for me.  actually all of the time.  i have a hard time (forgive me for using this word) parsing out all the pros and cons and looking objectively at things on the whole.  i focus too much on the tiny details and specificities versus the overall picture.  i suppose it goes hand-in-hand with my inability to ""go with the flow.""  it's funny how people, including myself, forget or don't realize how uptight i am.  either i'm becoming more objective in my old age or i'm just getting to know myself better.

well anyway, i'd like to get things ironed out/nailed down/other cliche like lined up for the summer and fall as soon as possible so i can quit worrying about the semantics of finishing my degree as planned and start worrying about the semantics and logistics of being away from albany for the summer and then coming back for a semester.  or maybe that won't end up being the case.  i've already yammered on about the worries of getting my lease/apartment deal figured out in some previous post.  then there would be the whole moving thing.  and so on and so on.  i literally could go on in a seemingly endless string of semi-coherent thoughts about the specific things i'll have to worry about, but then anyone who finds this on the wacky world wide web would have way too much insight into my crazy.  yes, my crazy.

okay, it's starting to get light out now.  i'm officially pissed.  i guess i could work on something that's due tomorrow and get it out of the way now instead of after my noon-thirty class.  alright, let me go put in an lj-cut so i don't eat up the friends page of all two of you.</lj-cut>

Plan A:
<ul>
<li> i take zero classes at school in Albany </li>
<li> i return to (northern) Ohio for the summer to work and potentially get some library experience</li>
<li> i attend the ALA national conference June 23-26</li>
<li> i live with and freeload off of my parents for the summer</li>
<li> i inform my landlord/property manager ASAP about the fact that I will be leaving the area at the end of this calendar year, hence leaving my horrible apartment</li>
</ul>
Plan B:
<ul>
<li> i take one class over the summer at school (this class runs July 9 to August 17)</li>
<li> i attend the ALA national conference June 23-36</li>
<li> i squeeze in my 150-hour internship requirement during this time as well</li>
<li> as a result, i only have to take 3 more classes in the fall to get my degree</li>
</ul>
Plan C:
<ul>
<li> i attend a study abroad in Slovenia (offered through UNC Chapel Hill) June 3-16 [which costs $3100, without airfare] and is presumably worth 3 graduate hours</li>
<li> i attend the ALA national conference June 23-26</li>
<li> i take zero classes in Albany / i take the aforementioned class July 9-August 17</li>
<li> in between these i guess i would be living with and freeloading off of my parents</li>
</ul>

I'm sure there are other combinations of activities I could perform this summer, but I'm starting to feel overwhelmed by options.  The thing that worries me the most is that I might be being a pussy about staying in Albany over the summer.  [WARNING: here comes my usual pseudo-self-analytical bullshit]  What I'm thinking is that I'm really becoming codependent.  I mean, honestly I'm nonfunctional up here by myself.  But it's almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy; I know I left Ohio with the grand intentions of becoming a different person, or just making changes for the better.  Deep down inside I was almost certain that this wouldn't happen.  And it hasn't.  If anything, I've become worse.  I feel worse about myself, about my life.  I'm full of anger, bitterness, and resentment.  And I feel like I'm always running home to Mommy.  And I get so lonely that I'm paralyzed.  I can't even bring myself to call my friends (or my family, oftentimes) because I'm so wrapped up in this sense of lonliness.  Anyway, sorry to bring all that into my honest plea for advice/suggestion on my potential summer plans.  The only other alternative I'm thinking of would be to sac up, get a job here for the summer and beyond, and deal with the other activities I'm considering on an individual basis.  Goddamnit I just don't know, and I apparently can't make my own decisions without the advice of others.  Somebody say something!!!</lj-cut>

As an unrelated post-script, I was just wondering about one of my classmates from last semester, and he just came up to me in the library - which is where I am.  Okay enough, I should be doing my problem set for stats.  For the love of god, help me out here.  Yes, all two of you who read this."

when i get home, i may be extremely pissed to have lost the hat that i just repurchased after i realized the original was missing.  we're talking about my gray ""snoogans"" hat.  i swear i put it in my coat pocket before i left the apartment, but it is no longer in my coat pocket.  so it may be breakdown time.  also, let me just say, if you know where my original snoogans hat is, please tell me.  holy shit.  i know where i kept it in columbus, but at some point since i went from there to here, it was misplaced or borrowed or something.  fyi, this is what it looks like:
http://jayandsilentbob.com/jaywinhatfro.html
i'm sure it's either lost in the universe or sitting somewhere that i haven't thought of.  so there's that plea to the public ... all 1 of you who reads this entry.

<lj-cut text=""i'm going to complain some more"">so i'm still sick.  i don't know if that's why i feel like complete ass, if it's just part of it, or if it's unrelated.  i haven't slept worth shit the last couple days.  i'll get really tired, so i get in bed, then i can't sleep.  perhaps relatedly, my radiator is now set on hellfire apparently, so i start boiling while i'm in bed.  then i throw off the covers and i'm cold.  regardless, i can't sleep.  and i should get up to do things for school, but for some reason that never seems plausible.  lord knows i haven't been diligent about school work thus far this semester, ruining my pseudo-plans for stepping up my school game.  i also haven't taken any steps to get an internship set up yet, so i've blown that plan as well.  i can't really make myself do anything, but i suppose that's standard for me anymore.  so the sensation of being adrift without direction continues to dominate.  it seems so contradictory, given that i'm getting a master's degree in a specific field, and yet here we are.  like in most of my classes, we have to develop our own topic for a project ... i'm completely clueless.  i pull these general, derivative ideas out of other literature the night before.  i don't feel like i've found my niche in my studies yet.  this is really disturbing to me.  i feel like having entered my second semester of grad school, i should know what i ultimately want to do.  again, i have a broad sense of where i'd like to work, but no idea what i'd like to specialize in. 

so the long and the short of it is that my life seems meaningless, insignificant, and so on.</lj-cut>

additionally, we have ""winter break"" february 16-23 or whatever the hell the dates are.  so i'll be heading back to ohio probably thursday night (the 15th) and coming back on the 26th.  the debate is whether or not i'll drive or take a train.  i haven't decided yet ... i guess it sort of depends on the weather.  it's not a super long break, but any opportunity i have to be around people i know is much better than the option of hanging out in my cave.  so there's that.

i'm going to try to pay attention for the last 15 minutes."

"event","so it's allegedly ""back to the grind"" time.  everything just feels surreal, though.  i'm still in this mindset where i feel like i'm killing time until the next phase in my life.  what i <i>should</i> be feeling is that i'm preparing for my ""actual"" adult life right now.  i don't know why i can't just get that going in my brain anyway.

i'm realizing more and more that i'm a creature of habit.  or rather that i'm really succeptible to patterns of behavior and self-fulfilling prophecy type of stuff.  like as soon as i got back to albany, back into this tiny depressing little apartment, i slipped right back into the non-functional, antisocial, can barely make myself take a shower, way of being.  i just don't know what to do with myself most of the time.  in addition, i think about absurd and/or terrible things most of the time when i actually get my brain to work.  whatever, all i do is complain about shit that nobody cares about.

i had more crazy dreams last night.  they all featured people from high school, people i haven't seen or spoken to in a long time.  and all most of these dreams involved me either fighting with or killing people - but other people, not my friends.  in one of them i had to fight rutger hauer of all people.  then in another, i think i was supposed to be the daughter of a king or some other royal-type person, except it was modern times.  and somebody killed him while he was sitting right next to me, so then i had to go do a revenge killing, but i could deal with the physical sensation of cutting someone's throat with my sword.  i can't remember what else happened.  but then my dream transitioned into some situation where i was hanging out with high school friends, and their mothers couldn't call me the right name.  one of them called me lisa, and i corrected her, and then she said she loved me.  i don't know, it's all wacky.  i dreamed about the high school boyfriend.  and i recall asking a girl from high school about the boy i always had a crush on (sometimes it was latent, sometimes overt).  he really was (and probably still is) perfect.  ah memories.  out of the blue he asked me to homecoming our junior year.  oh i'm swooning ... just kidding.

fucking shit.  well i think my classes might be better this semester ... maybe.  at least a couple of them - i have two with one professor that i really like so far.

why is stephen king's IT so scary?  fucking creepfest clown ... tim curry.  scary.

"event","oh i've been <i>dreaming</i> of posting for quite some time, i just never made myself do it until now.  so i've been at my parents' house since ... about a month ago.  i've done essentially nothing, though i was sick with some form of death plague for 1.5-2 weeks.  thankfully that's gone now.  i went down to columbus for new year's and again last weekend.  all the while i crashed at chris and paul's place, throwing a cog in the works of their lives.  i had fun ... hopefully i didn't drive them completely nuts.  i've done a few errands and things around the house for my parents, but other than that i've seriously been wasting time, space, and all things life.  at least the dogs are around to keep me company to some extent.

i've been having all sorts of strange dreams since i've been home.  i can't believe that i only dream wacky things here; i just think i'm waking up more frequently in this bed, and thus remembering my dreams more.

so let's see ... i had a semi-sexual dream about anthony lapaglia last night.  i know he's done a lot of things acting-wise, but i'm focusing on the <i>without a trace</i> character/aspect.  we must also consider that i have a weird thing for vincent d'onofrio circa law & order: criminal intent.  so what we see is a pattern of me crushing on t.v. cops.  so maybe i'm destined to marry a cop of sorts.  this does foil my plan of marrying some hot sugar daddy and keeping some foxy farmboy on the side.  i've already got the farmboy picked out, i just need the sugar daddy.  i can see that i'm digressing; not that i had a point in the first place.  i've also been dreaming about these crazy dogs almost every night.  and then i dreamed about my kindergarten teacher the other night.

i started scanning some old pictures yesterday.  my mom has insane amounts of photographs in various places throughout the house.  most of them are not in order or dated in any fashion.  they're still fun to look at, though.  i know that at some point in my life i was semi-cute.

ahh fuck, i clearly have nothing of import to say.  i'm driving back to albany on monday, which i'm not really looking forward to that much.  anyway, i'll stop for now.  holla back."

basically today through sunday, i have to average one 10-page paper a day.  i guess i can do that if i spend 8 hours a day in the library where there are zero distractions in the form of tv, movies, and loud noises.  technically one of these papers is not due until december 20th ... but everything else that's going on in my semester will be over by tuesday, so i see no reason to put it off and stick around here wallowing for an additional week.

all that being said, i should stop putting off the actual paper-writing.  the mantra has to be ""it'll be over soon.  it'll be over soon."""

"event","hopefully someone will get this .... do you ever get to the point where there are so many thoughts running through your head that you have no idea where to begin as far as getting them out?  i feel like my brain is constantly running.  if it's not about school (which should be my <i>sole</i> topic of thought right now), it's about what other mundane activity i <i>should</i> be doing at the time, or that i've chosen the completely wrong field of study, or that i'll never get a decent job, or that i'll never be a productive human being, or that i feel completely alone in the world - and sometimes i love it, sometimes i hate it, and so on.  i have irrational, fantastic (as in fantasy-based) thoughts all the goddamn time.  i can't ever make myself focus on the things that should be important.  i feel like i live life - or, rather, i exist - in a constant state of limbo, and this is because i really don't know what i'm doing.  nothing makes me happy anymore.  

i was only marginally happy over the thanksgiving holiday - and being with my family (primarily my mom and brother) has always been able to lighten me up.  the day after thanksgiving, we met up with my aunt and uncle and my one cousin and his wife (she's the one who suggested this field to me) at the trout club.  i wasn't in the mood to go really.  but i went, and i think i maybe said 15 words the entire time we were there (which was like 3 hours).  granted, my dad is never short on things to say, nor is the rest of my family, as it turns out.  i almost felt bad about not talking - like i was being a stick in the mud - but i just couldn't bring myself to get into any sort of conversation.  and, oddly enough, i didn't even feel like throwing back the drinks, which is what we all usually do out there.  it was a totally lackluster evening.  but i guess just for me.

the thing i've really been thinking about lately (as in the last couple of weeks) is that i really don't know what happened to me - to my spirit.  i remember - though not directly all the time - what i was like when i was younger.  i used to be a leader-type.  i used to take charge of groups, and willingly.  i was strong, independent, all the good things people want to be.  that person is totally gone now.  i'm afraid to take charge, to take risks.  i don't even open my mouth in classes unless a professor is going around the room getting everyone's opinions.  i'm a judgmental asshole.  i immediately put on a cynical perspective when i walk into certain classes or see or talk to certain people.  actually, it'd be more appropriate to say that i'm cynical about everything.  nothing seems true or valid.  i'm a disbeliever in everything and everyone - myself included.  all the things i used to care about and enjoy are gone.  music used to be such a huge part of my life.  really it was my whole life in high school ... now it's just gone.  i'm not a creative soul.  i have foolish thoughts and fantasies about what could happen, what i could do.  they're ridiculous - childlike.  i don't know what happened to me.  what broke my spirit and changed me into this thing?  i refuse to let it be the one simple thing i think it might be.  if that was it, then i don't deserve anything good ... i'd be the weakest, most pathetic individual anyone can imagine.  so maybe i am.  everything about me is lost.  just when i start to think i figure something out, i notice it's the opposite of what i once thought, so i dismiss it or chalk it up to the absurd.

the thinking gets started and it never stops.  so i need the good pills."

<lj-cut text=""all, all, all i do is BITCH"">i'm pretty sure i've been having a nervous breakdown for, oh i don't know, a month or two...?  i just feel absolutely shitty.  i feel completely cut off from the world.  i don't have any friends here.  i don't even foresee it happening.  whenever i'm not in classes, i'm in my apartment.  and when i'm in my apartment, i just sit there in a vegetative state.  i'm literally immobilized by whatever it is i'm feeling.

as i was getting into bed last night, thinking and talking to myself like usual, i had a minor epiphany.  the only reason i'm in graduate school is because of others' (my parents') expectations.  i mean, i always assumed and imagined that i'd go back to school.  i wanted to.  i like to learn.  but i sort of felt like i was at this impasse.  every time i throw out an idea to my parents (especially my dad), they assume that it's a given, that i will do it, that i want to do it.  well it's just not true.  i think a lot of the time i just throw stuff out there because i think it's what they want to hear.  yes, goddamnit, i'm a people-pleaser.  and the main focus of that attitdue is on my parents.  i don't know why i feel so desperate for their approval.  i know, at least superficially, that they love me and support me in ""whatever"" i do.  i guess i don't really feel that that's true.  they have expectations or me, and high ones at that.  i'm sure they don't mean to put pressure on me, but it's overwhelming most of the time.  in fact, the thing i think about when i start worrying about my grades is my parents.  i'm working to get these grades <i>for them</i>.  that's pretty much the opposite of what i should be doing.  then again, they are paying for me to go to school.  it just feels to me like i need to keep getting high grades to stay in their favor.  i have to get good grades and get this master's degree.  and then become the ""professional"" my mom has ""always known"" i would be.  she literally has said this to me on many occasions.  what if that's not what i want?  hmm, well, mom expects me to be a professional, so that's what i must do.

what i decided is that what i'd really like to do is own a video store.  or somehow work with movies.  i know it's absolutely childish.  but i've always loved movies.  it's a freakish sickness i think.  it seriously plays a role in my being non-functional in reality.  at least that's my newest theory.  maybe i could get a job with the MPAA or something.  whatever.  the point is that i feel like i'm in the completely wrong field of study.  but i don't feel the option is there (at least not viably) for me to change degree programs, transfer schools, or drop out of graduate school altogether.  mainly just because i couldn't take disappointing my parents like that.  i really wish more than anything that i knew how to be one of those carefree people.  or that i was one of those ""live life to the fullest"" people.  i wish i were somebody who's passionate about politics.  yes, i want to be one of those crazy, bleeding-heart liberals.  i want to chain myself to a tree.  i want to move to the middle of nowhere in newfoundland and have a quiet little existence without the need for all this goddamn technology and other bullshit.  i can't actually be any of those things, though.  i'm pretty much stuck.  how many people in the history of time have successfully ""reinvented"" themselves?  i'd bet the number is pretty low.  and i'm sure that those people were better men/women than i.  i wish i could be a writer.  but i don't have anything interesting to say.  nor am i creative enough to weave a complex and intriguing plot.  really there's nothing extraordinary about me at all, but i've always wished there was.

i also decided that my perfect life would entail the following: i would win the lottery.  not shit-tons of millions, but enough to cover myself and my family.  i would marry some beautiful, strapping, young farm boy - but he'd have to be intelligent, of course ... and not a redneck.  we would have a farm somewhere near mountains with lots of open space and several dogs.  we would also have a lovely, modest house on the beach.  i don't foresee myself having children, but if he wanted them, so be it.  it would be a casual existence.  no need for cocktail parties and ridiculous social constraints.  we'd be comfortable.  and i could have my goddamn video store as a side-business.  ha!  so there's my fanciful, ridiculous, and childish lifeplan for you.

bottom line is that, at least right now, i don't care about pretty much any of the things i should care about.  i care about and miss my friends and family.  i don't really give a shit about much else.  i don't care about school (maybe because i'm studying the wrong thing...?), i don't want any responsibilities, i, in fact, hate bills, credit cards, and money in all forms.

i just feel so alone, lost, and confused.  misery, i tell you.</lj-cut>

that was a long one, beware.  what's wrong with me?

there's a boy with some sort of mohawk sitting to my right.  he has a cold i think.  still cute."

"event","i think i want to buy a fish.  it's like a pseudo pet, really.  bettas are easy to take care of, aren't they?  what i really miss is my little man.  did i say it already?  i went to the mall a couple weeks ago and they have a pet store there.  well, there was a baby weiner in a cage there - he was all brown with a little white on his chest - well i watched him for like 5 minutes and i swear i almost cried.  he was so cute and i was so sad that he was in that damn metal cage.  i wanted to take him home immediately, but i left instead.  anyway, back to my point.  i want to buy a fish, but not one with an extravagant tank or anything.  simple little fish ... so that i can talk to myself but pretend i'm talking to the fish and/or a person.  maybe tomorrow.

i still have to go get a tb test.  yeah, i can't register for spring classes until i do.  don't ask me why, but the fucking health department only gives them on mondays between 1 and 3pm (which is of course when i have class).  so i get fucked into going to some walk-in clinic that's probably going to charge me some ridiculous sum as opposed to the $15 i'd have to pay at the health department.  i don't have fucking tb.  just because i went to russia 3 years ago i have to have this goddamn test.  fucking hell.  i hate the health care industry, at least in this country.  also, i think my insurance is not valid in this state.  i don't know what to do about that.  i mean, i know i have to call them, but then there's going to be some sort of rigamaroll and i'll have to ask about transferring the policy.  why can't all this shit be national like in canada anyway?  i fucking hate the business of adulthood.  it's all lame and stupid.  insurance and bills and credit scores and supposedly becoming professional and yadda yadda.

ultimate lamesville.

i don't know what else to say ... i had something but i forgot."

"event","i had another dream about the first boy i ever had a crush on.  this was a couple days ago, but i just started thinking about it again.  the biggest part i remember is that we were dancing.  i don't know what the deal is.  i haven't seen this guy in <i>years</i>.  actually, probably not since high school.  oh but he's perfect, i'm sure.

let's see.  i don't like at least two-fifths of my classes.  i don't like writing the papers i've had to write.  but i do like the library.  my head hurts and my jaw hurts.  i hate my tiny apartment.  i hate people who make lots of noise and are annoying.  i'm the biggest bitch in the universe.  the end.

oh wait, i ordered new glasses the other day.  and some prescription sunglasses, too."

"event","right now i so badly want to work ""mind bullets' into this paper i'm writing.  the teacher is cool, but somehow i don't think she's <i>that</i> cool.

alright, i've spent approximately 4-4.5 hours working on the paper, and i'm done for the day.  paul's going to read it for me and tell me what a piece of shit it is.  such a good friend.

earlier, i was the only person in my chosen corner of the library (the oversize section [like for giant atlases and such], so appropriate), and now there are like 6 other people back here, two of whom are having a whispered conversation.  i really like the library much better when it's quiet and i'm alone.

okay i'm freezing, time to go."

"event","they just busted a nail salon like 4 blocks down the street from my apartment ... they were running a whorehouse.  pair that with the guy i saw get arrested on the corner where i live a couple weeks ago, and i feel ultimately safe.

i'm getting pissy all over again.  feeling like this was a bad idea.  maybe i do need mood stabilizers.

tomorrow is paper-writing day.  these papers are not like the standard essays or research papers, so they're sort of awkward to write.  but no one cares about that.  i took a few pictures up in the adirondacks this weekend, but not many.  i'll post them later if they're worth anything; they were mostly taken while driving.

i don't feel so well."

"event","so i'm visiting my aunt and uncle in <i>up</i>-upstate new york for the weekend.  they live around saranac lake in the middle of the adirondack park/mountains.  for anyone who's never been here, you have no idea how gorgeous it is.  i'm going to try to take a lot of pictures.  it's just unreal.  it makes me feel better, for one thing, to be around people i know and love, and for another, to be surrounded by this natural beauty.  my aunt cathy and i took the dogs for a 2.5 mile walk down this dirt road that goes through the woods.  it's just amazing here.

for now, i'm going to attempt to get some schoolwork done."

"event","my ""happy faces"" so far for the day:
<blockquote>while walking to class, an elderly couple passed me, and the woman smiled wholeheartedly and said, ""good morning!""  you know that shit is infectious</blockquote>
<blockquote>as i purchased my mid-morning coffee, i went for my cash and it sort of all went all over.  the cashier says, ""whoa, you've got money flying out of your pockets!"", to which i replied, ""there's a first time for everything.""  and she said back, ""i like that.  you're quick.""  she doesn't have to know that that's sort of a parkerism.  i think that's the first time i've been officially referred to as ""quick"" - i assume as in quick-witted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>i realized while in class (my management class) that i actually <i>enjoy</i> doing long division ... who knew?</blockquote>
<blockquote>on my way back from class, i was walking over the footbridge across the lake - in this gorgeous early-fall weather, by the way - and a couple asked me very nicely if i would take their picture.  generally such things would induce vomitting from all my bitterness (especially since i saw them kissing as i approached), but it was actually quite lovely.</blockquote>

so what i've decided is that since all this generally happiness has occurred essentially before noon today, that the rest of the day is likely to blow hard.  i am finally making myself go to the laundromat, i have dishes to do, i need to start working on papers/assignments that are due next week, i have to make a credit card payment, i have to call the health department about getting a tb test (which will involve some sort of jabbing with sharp things) ...  so it's the polar opposite of how i've been feeling for the last many days.  it must be the hormone time of the month.  [sidenote: i just sang a little tune about my lunch.  what the fuck is wrong with me?]

so yes, due dates for assignments are approaching, which means i need to be more serious about my studies.  i mean, i haven't really been <i>slacking</i>, i just haven't been that focused.  i've done almost all of my reading completely ... there have only been a few chapters and whatnot that i've just skimmed.  anyway, buckle-down time.

i just had a newish idea.  today may be a phone-call type day."

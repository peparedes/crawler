"event","i just finished reading survivor by chuck palahniuk.  i really enjoyed it.  i found it to be much less intense than his other works, but with just as much to say.  definitely not my favorite, but a good read that i would recommend.  after i put it down, i decided to turn on nat geo tv, as i am wont to do.  and what, you may ask, was on?  a documentary about the heaven's gate mass suicide in 1997.

"event","Since I rp both Zhyal and Bheid in this story I thought I'd write up what happens between these two in a short ficlet format rather than try and rp it out with myself because that would be silly. Here goes.<br /><br />  <lj-cut>Sometimes it was healthy for a master and his pupil to part ways, but Bheid was fairly convinced this was not the sort of healthy parting he had expected. The split was a long time in coming, their views simply laid too far apart for a harmonious relationship to take place yet the two never fought so bitterly as they had today. A part of the young parlomancer had truly believed that his Maester would have seen reason or at the very least would not let him leave and be parted. Anger flared up and sped his steps down into the vault like underbelly of the priorate's main building that housed all of their collected artifacts.   Hastily he sped his way to the shelves and after moments of near frantic searching he came to what he was looking for. The tome was ancient and leather bound, greying in its old age with its hide pages worn so thin that great&nbsp; care had to be taken when opening and turning the pages. Bheid slowed his heart beat and breathing down as best he could and reverently removed the mysteries from its place in the shelf housing many more tomes like it, grimoires too. Placing it down on a research podium he held his breath as the cover was slowly and meticulously turned to open. Being a word weaver, books and scripts were of the highest importance to Bheid and the way he touched the tome could be construed as almost loving. <br /><br />As such it would take quite a few moments until he found what he was looking for in the correct passages. He knew what the Words were saying beyond what convention dictated they meant. A map appeared unbidden into his mind as his eyes skimmed across the holy words written in the same script and language as was emblazoned on the Imari herself, and they were telling him where she would be going next.   He couldn't very well go alone but to take human company risked far too much for his liking. Words were his weapons but he knew of one that would suffice should the Imari turn out to be hostile; unlikely in his opinion but worth the precaution all the same. It was back further into storage and took quite a few acrobatic of his tongue to spell out the right words to disable the wards around such a holy and protected artifact. He only needed it for his protection, he rationalized as he went, and soon the very ancient and very beautiful ring was in his possession. Getting back out of the vault and the priorate building itself took some doing, but for an expert parlomancer such as himself with powerful Words as his allies it was done without incident.   Knowing where the Imari would go next was one thing, getting there before she did would be another task entirely. <br /><br />The ancient shrine to the east was a run down pilgrimage attraction not often visited by any but the truly devout. At this time of year when the snow had begun to fall there were even less visitors than ever. It only took a few very well woven phrases in the ancient tongue and Bheid could feel himself becoming thin, as if his being were stretched to the point of becoming nothingness entirely. There was a pressure on his lungs, as if he were now in 2-D space and therefore by the constraints of physics unable to draw in breath. But the moment of discomfort only lasted a brief instant before he felt himself begin to reform. With a crack louder than any whip could make the pressure was suddenly gone and he could suck in a deep breath.   The shrine was empty and this far away it was already night and bitterly cold. Bheid tugged at his tunic to draw it closer as bone biting winds blew crosswise through him. <br /><br />There was very little shelter to be found but he made do in the partially standing part of the ancient structure. &quot;<em>Iahani do'wenna llynn</em>,&quot; he murmured, creating a Space. The constraints of his Space were a comfortable 23 degrees with a wind and snow barrier. It wouldn't last forever but as long as he remained within the confines of his bubble he would be dry and warm as he waited. That wait was far shorter than he could have predicted or hoped for. An all too familiar <em>crack</em> resounded about the ruins and through the settling dusk he could see an illumination of faint violet. She was looking right at him. Now was the time to test his convictions and his faith and to see if everything he'd ever believed in was all just a mistaken translation or perhaps an outright lie.  He watched as the Imari strode toward him, her white hair streaming behind her in the wind yet she looked utterly unaffected by the bitter cold despite having on only a very sheer material for a dress. Bheid tried desperately not to gape.   <br /><br />&quot;Wordweaver,&quot;&nbsp;she addressed him with a snapping tone, obviously she didn't feel as though he belonged here, &quot;what is a man doing in this sacred place? I have come to call my kindred, you are not one of us.&quot;  <br /><br />Bheid hadn't quite been expecting that as an introduction and when her eyes narrowed and peered around him he surmised his magics were also not welcome in this holy place. With a whispered word the Space collapsed around him into nothingness and he was thrust back out into the chill. He hoped it came across as a sign of his obedience and respect. Now if only he could find his voice. &quot;I come to serve the Imari if she will have me,&quot; Bheid tried.  <br /><br />&quot;The Imari shall not have you,&quot;&nbsp;came her immediate reply, even her words seemed to dismiss him.  <br /><br />&quot;But...&quot;&nbsp;he had come all this way, he wasn't leaving with that unsatisfactory answer. &quot;I come as your willing servant,&quot;&nbsp;Bheid said, taking a daring step forward as if she would get a closer view and be convinced of his sincerity. &quot;There are those who wish you destroyed, I&nbsp;have come as a warning and a loyal servant. Please...let me be of some service to you.&quot; <br /><br /> She seemed to consider it, or perhaps he was reading too much into her unreadable expression. &quot;Those who wish me destroyed will be destroyed themselves. I&nbsp;care not for the threats of man. Leave.&quot;  <br /><br />Anger pulsed through the young and hot blooded priest. &quot;No! I came all this way and I know I did not do it in vain. You <em>will</em> <em>not</em> toss me aside. If you wont allow me to serve you then...&quot; his hand reached into his pocket and pulled out the ring, &quot;then you will serve me!&quot; It had been taken initially with the idea of being a last resort for his own protection and then to be given up to her as a sign of his loyalty and dedication, but the power it could wield called out to him so strongly that he couldn't resist. Slipping on the ancient ring he aimed his fist out toward her, unsure of how exactly this should work. &quot;I command you now.&quot;  <br /><br />The Imari's eyes narrowed but her lips were curving into something similar to a smile, except far more primal. &quot;Foolish little man. The only usefulness you will ever serve is the offering up of that ring and your own death with it. You know not even how it works,&quot; she took a menacing step toward him to prove her point. &quot;Now give me that ring.&quot;  <br /><br />Bheid could tell he had no authority over her. Perhaps he should have spent more time studying how the ring was used rather than where it had been found. Too late for that now. She was lifting up her hand and he could feel the build in energy as she called upon ancient powers. Fear sent a shiver down his spine unrelated to the chill of the weather. &quot;<em>Ouscurii</em>,&quot; Bheid all but yelped just in time for a violet streak to lash out at him and dissipate against a crackling but invisible shield. He knew he couldn't battle her one on one especially if the ring wasn't working.<br /><br /> She didn't wait for him to think. In the moment that she saw her spell matched by his own woven word she lashed out physically moving far too fast for Bheid to evade. Her blow sent him stumbling back into a wall and before he could catch his breath she was striding furiously toward him. He evaded one fist to his right which splintered the stone behind him and then another fist to his left. Her arms stayed where they were to either side of him, trapping him with her body pressing close.   His wide eyes widened further as lips met but this was anything but a kiss of passion. Bheid could feel her breathing into his lungs, filling them with something hot and <em>alive</em>. A smoke-like substance ran between their lips and his once numb and frozen skin began to feel as if on fire. He tried coughing it back out but she only pressed harder. He could feel it in the cavities of his nose and up into his sinuses and watched in struggling amazement as the greyish-violet smoke traveled back out his nostrils and into the frigid air. <br /><br />Brown eyes began clouding with the smokey substance and finally she backed away to let him crumble to the ground wheezing and coughing until he lay half slumped against the wall with sightless violet eyes staring at nothing. He could rest easily now with the knowledge that he was finally her servant. A&nbsp;husk of a man on puppet strings with a consciousness screaming silently behind clouded eyes. <br /><br />Edit: Fucking Live Journal! Destroyed all my goddamn editing when I&nbsp;went to put it into a goddamn cut. I'm obviously pissed about this.<br /></lj-cut>"

He was nearly lost in his preoccupation till Seyd spoke up, and then he reflexively looked up. For a moment, he was quiet. &quot;She is not my maker,&quot; he finally said. &quot;This is my place.&quot; Even with the disturbing emptiness where his former bond to his master had been, he had developed a remarkable sense of loyalty. Kerigan, for his part, didn't know enough about golems to recognize how significant that was. He was much more concerned, and understandably so, with the impending end of the world. &quot;So this ring. How do we get it?&quot;</font></div></div><div id=""1215"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; color: rgb(215, 51, 6);""><b>thmightykeyboard</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(5:29:25&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000"">Seyd was more curious about this response than touched but he couldn't really spend the time trying to question Elym for suitable answers when there were important tasks to be dealt with. For one, finding that ring. Kerigan certainly had his mind on that track and so the golemologist dragged his attention from his assistant, &quot;I'm sure there are a few texts that may help to direct us...though...&quot; and here he tried to broach the topic with some caution. &quot;It may be a myth, no one is exactly sure of the ring's origin or existence...but we have to try, right? Elym...would you happen to know which documents would be pertinent to our research?&quot; </font></div></div><div id=""1216"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; color: rgb(15, 5, 149);""><b>bythemilligram</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(5:38:42&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""1"" face=""Arial"" color=""#000000"">Great. Their best shot at getting this under control was the stuff of legends, and legends were notorious for not always being true. Kerigan didn't like the sound of that. Elym, however, took his maker's words at face value, and cocked his head as he mentally ran through the vast library he'd read and learned from. &quot;There is a chapter in the Kyrien Volumes about the ring,&quot; he answered after a few minutes, &quot;but it's vague. The Mysteries have more information. However, as you know, they are only partially translated.&quot;</font></div></div><div id=""1217"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; color: rgb(215, 51, 6);""><b>thmightykeyboard</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(5:50:28&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000"">Seyd sighed in agreement. &quot;And the only ones who can fully translate them with any amount of accuracy are the priorate's parlomancers...and even then only the most skilled ones.&quot; Not exactly like they could simply walk in and ask for a translated copy of a holy text, and breaking in was damn near impossible. There were charms and amulets all over the building, not to mention wards and scripts built in like passcodes. It wasn't exactly a mission for a bookish golemologist, his creation, and an ex-soldier. &quot;Should we be taking this matter to them?&quot; On the one hand it could mean getting a few zealots ready to help end the world but they all couldn't be ready to die, right? There were some sects who were against the aid of the Imari.</font></div></div><div id=""1223"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; color: rgb(15, 5, 149);""><b>bythemilligram</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(5:59:43&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""1"" face=""Arial"" color=""#000000"">He was understandably wary to approach anyone from that side of the plaza, but it didn't sound like they had much choice. Besides, if there was one thing he'd learned, it was that the faithful had a great talent for infighting. If there was a group that actually wanted this thing to destroy the world (damned psychopaths) then there was bound to be a group that didn't. &quot;We'd have to talk to the right people. There was a guy years ago who headed off one of the more moderate sects in this town...Haza. Alin Haza.&quot; But hell, that was years ago, and he frowned thoughtfully. &quot;I don't know the names of anyone who was under him.&quot; &quot;But the priorate would,&quot; Elym chimed in.</font></div></div><div id=""1224"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; color: rgb(215, 51, 6);""><b>thmightykeyboard</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(6:03:51&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000"">&quot;You didn't happen to be in his military service during the great conflict, did you? An official seal of his office would get you to the right places without many questions asked.&quot; Since no real issues had been solved during that war they had agreed on a truce and any business in one sect was that sect's business, getting too nosey was never a good idea. Otherwise he was sure they'd be questioned mercilessly unless they thought of another plan.</font></div></div><div id=""1225"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; color: rgb(15, 5, 149);""><b>bythemilligram</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(6:08:25&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""1"" face=""Arial"" color=""#000000"">&quot;Not me,&quot; he answered, glancing aside. &quot;But I can get that seal.&quot; No sense wasting time. He got to his feet. &quot;Find out whatever you can about this thing we're looking for. I don't keep those papers with me.&quot; He'd have to go home to retreive them; it wasn't far. It felt a little strange, maybe even a little wrong to do what he was going to. But it was for the sake of preventing another war. Efran would have wanted that much.</font></div></div><div id=""1226"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; color: rgb(215, 51, 6);""><b>thmightykeyboard</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(6:15:38&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000"">&quot;Alright, you can meet back here, I'll inform the front to give you full access.&quot; With a nod he bustled himself over to the books. They hadn't a great deal of time and he had quite the research work to do. &quot;Elym...try to find any references you can concerning the Imari and the Great War. We may have to go on hints and references rather than straight literature fact. Cross reference your knowledge banks with what you find, pick out any similarities and agreements between texts, that will most likely be our greatest hope.&quot; Seeing as how they did not have The Mysteries on hand, only the higher ups of the priorate had access to it. </font></div></div><div id=""1227"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; color: rgb(15, 5, 149);""><b>bythemilligram</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(6:24:23&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""1"" face=""Arial"" color=""#000000"">It was a hefty task - the sort of thing research golems were created for. It was far easier for him to store and catalog all this information than for a human to do the same. He tagged along after Seyd, then went quiet as his mind worked, sorting through his records. That was enough to give him a few good starting points - he had a general understanding of most of the collection, but would have to actually find the specifics himself, and set about doing just that, till he'd accumulated a good stack of books and scrolls to work through.&nbsp; Fortunately, he was built for efficiency in that.</font><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; color: rgb(15, 5, 149);""> </span><font size=""1"" face=""Arial"" color=""#000000"">By the time he returned, Elym had worked his way through that stack, and he had what he'd gone after. &quot;I'm not sure if this'll count for enough to get us in smoothly,&quot; he admitted, holding up the old, well-worn and folded paper he'd brought back. &quot;But if whoever's filled in for Haza is anything like he was, it should.&quot; Elym glanced up from where he sat, tilting his head to peer up at the paper. &quot;A conscription notice. Yours?&quot; Kerigan quietly tucked it back into his pocket. &quot;Not mine. I didn't serve under Haza.&quot;</font></div></div><div id=""1233"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; color: rgb(215, 51, 6);""><b>thmightykeyboard</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(6:52:02&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000"">Seyd was curious (wasn't he always?) but he had enough social grace not to pester the man about his past affiliations in the war. Whatever he had he held protectively, indicating enough to the golemologist that this was personal. &quot;Then do you think we could get in? Or should you perhaps go alone?&quot; It was always a toss up whether or not his kind would be welcome in the priorate, often times it was not the case to be ushered right in.</font></div></div><div id=""1234"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; color: rgb(15, 5, 149);""><b>bythemilligram</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(6:57:21&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""1"" face=""Arial"" color=""#000000"">&quot;You better come. You have a better sense of what we're looking for. Bring him too,&quot; he added, nodding towards Elym. He'd picked up on the golem's usefulness as sort of a walking library; might come in handy. He understood the politics of it - scientists were viewed with disdainful suspicion by the religious types, and vice versa, but it wouldn't do them any good for him to get in by himself and not know what he was doing there. He needed some inside intelligence, and that was where Seyd came in.</font></div></div><div id=""1236"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; color: rgb(215, 51, 6);""><b>thmightykeyboard</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(7:09:24&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000"">&quot;Alright, then let's not waste any time. Elym, you can cross reference on the way.&quot; Odd how it seemed their bond was tampered with yet his golem still followed his commands. Something to look into at a later time. Ah but how interesting it would be to learn more. With Kerigan and Elym in tow they made their way down to the lobby and out the wide double doors. The plaza seemed so normal and mundane in light of who had possibly walked right out these doors in front of their faces. Seyd couldn't say he liked the sight of the domineering building in front of them but he trailed along across marble vaneer and soon, all too soon, they arrived at the ornate doors of the priorate. The building was no less impressive on the inside where the ceiling arched up almost into the sky and intricate, priceless pieces of work adorned the walls and hung as tapestries. No sooner had they stepped foot inside a wisened little man appeared, striding up to them as if he were a towering giant. &quot;What business have you? Mm? Hm? What business?&quot; Seyd heard three distinct raps from the man's cane on the tiled floor. &quot;We...ah...we...&quot; &quot;Speak up boy! Spit it out, spit it out. I don't have all day.&quot;</font></div></div><div id=""1245"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; color: rgb(15, 5, 149);""><b>bythemilligram</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(7:55:59&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""1"" face=""Arial"" color=""#000000"">Kerigan didn't like bureaucrats.

It's important.&quot; His hand was in his pocket, resting on the conscription notice; he'd hoped they could get in without invoking it, but this little man obviously had some sense of power, so there might be no getting around it.</font></div></div><div id=""1246"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; color: rgb(215, 51, 6);""><b>thmightykeyboard</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(8:06:26&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000"">Behind half moon glasses were two little eyes full of a fire that seemed out of place on his aged body and they were peering up suspiciously at Kerigan. &quot;Alin Haza is no longer with us, he belongs to the spirit now. You wish to see Maester Ji-Han, a very busy man.

He glanced briefly to Seyd, as if to ask if he had any ideas here, then looked back to the little man. &quot;My brother served under Haza.

He was interrupted from his meditation by the guide's words, and opened his eyes, glancing over.

Sitting at the ornate desk was a very stately looking man and Seyd faltered not knowing quite what to say. &quot;We...ah...sir, that is...we would very much like to know your stance on the Imari...&quot; What a way to break the ice, but Seyd delt with books and Elym most of his days, he was certainly not used to this environment.</font></div></div><div id=""1253"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; color: rgb(15, 5, 149);""><b>bythemilligram</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(8:52:49&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""1"" face=""Arial"" color=""#000000"">It was the sort of thing a man in his position got asked from time to time - and that was fair enough, he thought. People had a right to know what their religious leaders really believed. But this particular question, with such noteworthy timing, didn't seem like it could be a coincidence. Still. Perhaps it was. Either way, it would do him no good to start interrogating them about why they would ask such a thing. There was a question before him, and so he answered, fingers laced together in a reflective gesture. &quot;I recognize it as a source of great change and upheaval. But I would also say that such change can never come smoothly, and perhaps shouldn't come at all. Not at the cost of mortal life.

In any event, she's awake, Zhyal that was her name, and we have reason to believe she is the Imari.

The first questions to cross his mind - who had referred him here, and wasn't Haoti an unusual name for this part of the world? - were immediately eclipsed by what this Seyd had to say next. Ji-Han was glad he was sitting down already. &quot;You were the one to awaken her?&quot; he asked, eyes fixed on the golemologist. He and Bheid had both been able to tell it had happened nearby - but as nearby as that? Even he hadn't expected that. He seemed sincere, which only made this more sobering. &quot;You have unleashed something fearsome, Seyd Isuldri.&quot; If he sounded stern, who could blame him? But after a moment, his expression softened, just a little. &quot;Though if such a golem were left to move through the world, someone would have awoken her eventually. If not you, then another.

She'll do it to others, now.&quot; Ji-Han was briefly surprised to hear a golem speak up like that - without direction or prompting from his master - but that fit with what he was saying. &quot;It makes sense. Creatures built of earth and clay are in the Imari's realm, in the ancient stories. They would provide an army for her.&quot; &quot;That's what we're worried about,&quot; Kerigan confirmed. </font></div></div><div id=""1258"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; color: rgb(215, 51, 6);""><b>thmightykeyboard</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(9:47:01&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000"">&quot;Mm yes, so it would seem she has that ability, I didn't witness it myself but i have seen the changes in Elym and they are quite unnatural.&quot; And now?

The Eniat clearly defines our course of action and I respectfully---&quot; Bheid stopped mid argument with a lurch. A holy word had been spoken not far from where they stood arguing in his mentor's office over phrasings. He was a parlomancer, a sorcerer of words. Some words were very mundane, most of the ones used in daily speech held no power beyond the ability to convey thought. Other words, however, had deeper meanings and a magic all of their own. Just speaking one could conjure up ancient magics lost to the ages. Only if such a word had a profound impact did his senses pick up on it, and being so close it had felt like one of the great bells were ringing in his head. &quot;Holachim,&quot; he repeated, reverence apparent in his hushed tone. &quot;Someone has employed the Word.&quot; Bheid's demeanor and expression conveyed all the surprise he was feeling.</font></div></div><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;"" id=""899""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; color: rgb(15, 5, 149);""><b>bythemilligram</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(11:57:52&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""1"" face=""Arial"" color=""#000000"">Whatever they had been arguing about fell away the moment that word was spoken; immediately, Ji-Han could sense something, nameless but intense. And there were so few reasons for that word to be spoken. It was mostly buried in their most ancient of texts, held as especially sacred by those who wove words - a gift at which his longtime student excelled. But Ji-Han was never one to jump to conclusions, and fell silent, eyes half-closed, as though his mind were very far away. He was trying to feel it out, get a solid grip on the energy he'd just felt. It was a long moment before he deemed it to be certain, and as realization dawned, he slowly sat down at the ornate chair behind his desk. This was a moment to be remembered. &quot;This is the Awakening.&quot;</font></div></div><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;"" id=""900""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; color: rgb(215, 51, 6);""><b>thmightykeyboard</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(12:04:19&nbsp;AM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000"">&quot;Then you should know what needs to be done,&quot; Bheid all but whispered with a voice soft yet full of force and intent.

We <i>must</i></font><font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000""> find the Imari and offer up ourselves in her service. Even you cannot deny that now.&quot; They'd argued enough times over the Eniat's teachings but never so fiercely than over the Imari.

When he'd bought this thing, he'd been under the impression that it would just...work. Granted, he wasn't terribly proud of <i>why</i> he'd bought it, but it wasn't anything uncommon these days, with golems getting more and more realistic. It had been an impulsive purchase, and hell, why not? But then he'd gotten it home, and it had just...sat there. He tried talking to it. He looked for some kind of a switch. Nothing. Hey, he'd never owned one before. Eventually, he came to the conclusion that there was just no getting around it -&nbsp; he needed some outside help here. Wasn't there a whole department on these things down at the town library? It wasn't like he'd have to say why he had this particular golem...just that he didn't quite know how to turn it on. Reasoning that it would look a little too strange to just carry it in, he folded it carefully into his old wheeled trunk, and that was what he brought with him, right up to the desk at the library.</font></div></div><div id=""798"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; color: rgb(215, 51, 6);""><b>thmightykeyboard</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(5:30:14&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000"">Ceyleon's atmosphere was alive yet calm. Full of educators and scholars the city was wealthy in information and thought and the two were its biggest trade commodity. It seemed the entire continent of Elatur was in great need of knowledge judging by the extensive use of costly marble that lined streets and curved up into flowing fountains and sculptures lining the open and quite beautiful Cellistine square. The most prominent building sat towering in the center of view dominating the landscape with its towers and spines. Decorated in ancient symbols and flowing banisters awash in bold colors was the state's priorate, protector of all the religious texts and laws. Directly oposing, perhaps by design, and across the plaza was the scholarly hub, adorned in its own banners with deep purples and rich golds, symbols of knowledge and logical thinking. It was here that Seyd worked in the golem research division and was rapidly becoming head of his department and forerunner in Golemology. He did several contracting work with golem engineers on their various projects but he much rather preferred the solitude of study. So it was natural that the stuffy head of the insitute would lead this visitor back to his little nook. Kerrigan would have to dodge towers of books and scrolls that seemed to be haphazardly dispersed about the room. The mound that was elevated toward the center was ostensibly his desk. Peering up through two full moons of glass Seyd blinked a few times to clear his vision from the close up strain of reading symbols to have the other's face come into more clarified view. &quot;Can I help you?&quot;</font></div></div><div id=""799"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; color: rgb(15, 5, 149);""><b>bythemilligram</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(5:38:57&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Helvetica"" absz=""10"">What a place. Kerigan was no scholar, never had been - he'd gotten the same basic education everyone did, but unlike so many others around here, he hadn't gone past that. If he had, if he'd been enrolled in studies, the conscription notice never would have shown up at his door. But he hadn't, and it had, and that was just the way it went. He did come to the library now and then, when he felt like he needed to stretch his mind, but for the most part it just wasn't his area. He had practical knowledge, and in his experience, that was what got one by from one day to the next. It didn't help him work a golem, though. So here he was. &quot;They told me to come here,&quot; he stated. &quot;You know about golems.

Why he practically wrote the book on golems! Seyd didn't take offense but merely got up and took off his glasses to wipe the smudges off on his scholar's tunic. With them back on he made his way over. &quot;Seyd Isuldri,&quot; he indicated with a familiar salute in greeting, curling his hand lightly to make a fist, bringing the knuckle of his first finger to his lips and then splayed his open hand palm up. From the mouth of one to the ears of many or so the gesture meant, the equivalent of the holy gestures. &quot;A golem you said? Do you know of its maker, its origin?&quot; His eyes spotted the case and piqued his interest. &quot;You have it with you? Come, come, this way to where it is less clustered.&quot; If he needed any of his books he could have Elym get them. His trusted and self-made golem was a curious sort, somehow he inadvertantly had given it a sense of humor. Or at least the incentive to try. </font></div></div><div id=""801"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; color: rgb(15, 5, 149);""><b>bythemilligram</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(5:53:01&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Helvetica"" absz=""10"">Neither a scholar nor a religious man, Kerigan just nodded in response, glancing to his trunk when Seyd mentioned it. He could just as easily have carried the thing in, but it looked realistic enough that he'd have earned some unneeded attention. At Seyd's indication, he followed him to the less chaotic area, then crouched down to unfasten the latch on the case. &quot;I don't know where it's from,&quot; he admitted. &quot;I...found it.&quot; Well, it was sort of true. He really doubted the man selling it had been its creator - seemed too shady even for an alchemist. Carefully, he worked his arms under the golem, as limp and unresponsive as a doll, and drew it out, looking for someplace to set it down. She'd been clothed in sort of an unremarkable draped tunic when he bought her, and still was. And she was certainly beautiful.</font></div></div><div id=""802"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; color: rgb(215, 51, 6);""><b>thmightykeyboard</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(6:03:35&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000"">He had to wonder how a man like this would come across such a finely made golem. Certainly didn't seem the type to dabble in these sorts of things. Found it? That was debateable. With a point he indicated a research table made of solid mahogany and had the man lay her down across it. My she was something to look at but his focus was not on her beauty but on her face and clavical where faint script seemed to pulse to his magic sensitive eyes. He whistled beneath a breath. This was no oridinary house golem or even the more sophisticated research golems. This was something entirely different but he had not the idea of what it could be. &quot;How curious. These markings, I have seen them before but I can't remember in what text. Certainly no common &quot;<i>find</i></font><font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000"">&quot;. Where did you say you found it?&quot; He was up close and personal now to the golem laying on his table, peering at the craftmanship to determine perhaps a region of origin from the base material used.</font></div></div><div id=""803"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; color: rgb(15, 5, 149);""><b>bythemilligram</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(6:08:08&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Helvetica"" absz=""10"">&quot;Does it matter?&quot; Hell. If it didn't, the man wouldn't keep asking, would he? Kerigan bit back a sigh. &quot;Secondhand dealer. I didn't get his name. So - can you make it work?&quot; He was nothing if not to the point, an old habit that had embedded itself into his personality years back. Either this Seyd could get the golem...turned on, for lack of a better word, or he couldn't. If it was the former, great. If it was the latter, he wasn't sure what he'd do. Maybe try to sell it himself or something. Just because he'd damn near given up on women didn't mean he wanted an unconscious doll hanging around either.</font></div></div><div id=""804"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; color: rgb(215, 51, 6);""><b>thmightykeyboard</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(6:14:10&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000"">&quot;Mm. Well that does not help me narrow down its maker. Very well.&quot; A disappointment but surely not one he couldn't possibly make due with. If he had a name to contact he could surely discover all there was to know about this particular beauty. &quot;You see, a creator has a choice when making a golem in the manner that they are activated. Most house golems are created with a simple command inscription on the forehead, one must simply read it forwards to activate and backwards to deactivate. Very simplistic, very effective. The problem here, you see, is that the script this one is written in is not one I am familiar with. Let alone it could very well not be the method to awaken it.&quot; He chewed lightly on his lower lip, thinking this over. &quot;Elym! I will need your assistance with this one!&quot; Seyd called out for his research golem who was probably dittering around somewhere, he'd given it an exceptional amount of free will and self awareness, perhaps a little too much.

It wasn't a language he recognized either, whatever it was. Suddenly, they had company. Another golem, he realized after a moment. They really seemed to be everywhere lately, and he was just a little curious as he watched the creature come over to join them.Elym was, to his maker's credit, very well-designed for his purpose. It would have been enough for most scholars to have someone to keep things organized, sort through long texts, that sort of thing. But Elym actually did his own research, fueled by something very much like curiosity. He was poring over a dusty old tome when his master called, and lingered there another moment before wandering over to the table. &quot;Oh,&quot; he murmured, cocking his head and peering down at the golem on the table. &quot;Where did she come from?&quot; </font></div></div><div id=""811"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; color: rgb(215, 51, 6);""><b>thmightykeyboard</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(6:28:13&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000"">&quot;That is something I would very much like to know,&quot; he quipped with a tone of very light irritation.

Oh well, best not to dwell on what is not and focus on what is. &quot;It was brought in by this gentleman...Ah, I did not catch your name,&quot; he realized with sheepish embarrassment. Seyd wasn't always on top of his social graces. &quot;In any case I need that script analyzed, he wants to awaken it and as I do not have the rights to sequester it for study I would very much like to ask it a few questions myself before he takes his leave of us.&quot;</font></div></div><div id=""812"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; color: rgb(15, 5, 149);""><b>bythemilligram</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(6:36:15&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Helvetica"" absz=""10"">&quot;Kerigan Haoti.&quot; The lack of mutual introduction had sort of slipped by him too - Seyd had bustled him right off to look at the golem, and he hadn't even realized he hadn't given a name before that. Elym, meanwhile, was very intently looking the female golem over, his artificial mind working at its finest. Unlike his master, he didn't need to worry about distractions like food or sleep, which left him free to study as long as he wanted - he could spend days just learning from the great archives if he wasn't interrupted. What would have taken Seyd alone who-knew-how-long to look up was a simple matter for Elym (who managed to look pensive all the while, an expression he'd copied from Seyd). After a minute or two, he looked up to Kerigan. &quot;Shouldn't you be at the priorate with this?&quot; Kerigan, who was briefly startled at being addressed directly by the golem, blinked. &quot;The priorate?&quot;</font></div></div><div id=""813"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; color: rgb(215, 51, 6);""><b>thmightykeyboard</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(6:40:05&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000"">A fact that Elym rarely let him forget that he could spend all his resources and time devoted to study.

Only a thought. He was just as startled by the suggestion and a little offended. &quot;The priorate indeed!

This text is not used for secular matters.&quot; He devoted another moment to studying it intently, then tilted his head. &quot;Then again. If you bring it there, they will never give it back.&quot; Kerigan had always assumed golems were straightforward and mechanical. This one seemed to be an exception. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; he demanded. Elym simply turned and went back out to the shelves they'd left behind, leaving Kerigan to stare after him, an eyebrow raised. &quot;You build him yourself?&quot; he asked Seyd with a dry glance. It was another minute or two before Elym returned, carrying a positively ancient book and setting it neatly down next to the golem on the table.</font></div></div><div id=""815"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; color: rgb(215, 51, 6);""><b>thmightykeyboard</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(6:51:43&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000"">&quot;Don't even get him started,&quot; Seyd replied, his glance also on his departing golem.

Certainly to his knowledge the priorate did not create golems but had them ordered to be built, and he was quite positive no order would have come through for golem of this...detail.

He had a well-earned distrust of the whole religious side of society - the rough, commoner's faith he'd been brought up with was long gone. So what did it even mean, a golem with religious scripts on it? Had the man selling it stolen it from a temple or something? He'd sooner give the thing back than get mixed up in the affairs of the church.

Slowly it began to rise until seated, its gaze slowly trailing from one to the next stopping on Seyd. &quot;You spoke the command,&quot; her voice was almost musical if it were not so flat. Seyd didn't exactly know what to say. &quot;I...I did, yes, but I am not your creator or your master.&quot; He just wanted to be clear. She looked softly puzzled. &quot;I have no master nor creator.

He reached out a hand to feel along the &quot;skin&quot; of her face but his fingers never made it. Her hand shot outward, tendrils of violet energy ensaring the curious human about his throat. Her skin paled whiter while her eyes and scripts grew brighter. Her white hair whipped about in an unfelt wind.

Elym, however, was driven by his attachment to his master, and stepped forward, trying in vain to pull the glowing threads away from Seyd's throat. &quot;No!

Her dimly lit eyes studied his manufactured facial features.</font></div></div><div id=""852"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; color: rgb(15, 5, 149);""><b>bythemilligram</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(10:39:00&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Helvetica"" absz=""10"">Of course, that left the question of just what they were going to do with it. His first instinct was to get it as far from civilization as possible, to keep it out of anyone's hands. But this wasn't the ordinary golem he'd intended to buy; who was to say it wouldn't just...come back? Elym, meanwhile, was captivated. As if drawn in, he stepped closer to her, slowly reaching out. Even after seeing what she'd done to his master, he felt compelled to simply touch her, to be in contact with this being.</font></div></div><div id=""853"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; color: rgb(215, 51, 6);""><b>thmightykeyboard</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(10:52:54&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000"">The whispers faded as he approached and instead became song. Slowly her head moved back to a more upright position as Elym was pulled in closer. Seyd watched stunned at his golem's actions but he was at a loss as to what to do about it. He knew if he intervened he'd probably be seeing those ribbons again and his throat ached and stung just at the thought. Zhyal leaned forward and placed two fingers to Elym's forhead and pressed down, scrawling out a curving and looped symbol with just her touch. She leaned further and her lips brushed against his ear. &quot;<i>Ifina aerijani ahy evafilo iosol</i></font><font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000"">,&quot; she whispered. <i>Awaken child and join my song</i></font><font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000"">. Seyd's brow furrowed. Alright, something had to be done. &quot;Mihca---&quot; he began to say her seal backward when she moved faster than his eyes could follow. A streak of violet lashed out and struck him full in the chest sending the scholar flying up and back across the room and into shelves of books and scrolls. He collapsed into a heap as the contents of the broken shelving came crashing down with him. Without the ancient ring she could not be controlled.</font></div></div><div id=""854"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; color: rgb(15, 5, 149);""><b>bythemilligram</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(11:02:20&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Helvetica"" absz=""10"">&quot;Seyd!&quot; That voice was not Elym's, but Kerigan's, and with only a moment's glare towards the wild creature he hurried over to try and help the scholar out of the pile of debris. This was getting out of hand. He didn't know what Zhyal was doing to the other golem, but she was clearly dangerous. &quot;You okay?&quot; While he was focused on helping Seyd out of the mess that had been his bookshelf, Elym was being...transformed, really. His mind was changing, opening up - something very strange was happening, and he could really <i>feel</i> it. He actually let out a soft sound, a little surprised cry, then slowly looked back at his fallen master. No - was he? Was he master, or was he just...Seyd? Helpless, he looked back to Zhyal for answers. &quot;...What...am I?&quot;</font></div></div><div id=""855"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; color: rgb(215, 51, 6);""><b>thmightykeyboard</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(11:12:56&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000"">Seyd was unconscious but alive and relatively unharmed compared with what she could have unleashed on him. Perhaps she had meant to kill him since the one who awakens her is the only one able to put her back into her trance, until the weilder of the ring makes his appearance. She didn't feel its tug in the world and could only hope it had been forggotten or destroyed. Her fingers trailed through Elym's hair, she wasn't concerned now about the men. &quot;You <i>are</i></font><font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000""> now,&quot; she intoned, &quot;you no longer are bound you are free.

He was, wasn't he? When he looked at Seyd, something was just different, like a thread had been cut. The lost connection was profoundly startling, and he drew back. &quot;I have to help Seyd...&quot; That was his default, the closest thing any of his kind would have to an instinct. But Kerigan already had him, carefully extracting him from the mess Zhyal had made. At the sight of his creator knocked out, he looked hastily back to Zhyal. &quot;You've...hurt him,&quot; he realized slowly. Kerigan, meanwhile, could do little but watch this bizarre scene unfold. Seyd was still breathing and looked okay - he'd just taken a good knock to the head. Kerigan would keep an eye on him till he came to, at least.</font></div></div><div id=""857"" style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><div style=""margin: 0px 5px 4px -5px; padding: 0px 5px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; color: rgb(215, 51, 6);""><b>thmightykeyboard</b><aim:timestamp style=""display: inline; font-size: 11px;"">&nbsp;(11:30:30&nbsp;PM)</aim:timestamp>:</span> <font size=""2"" face=""Calibri"" color=""#000000"">&quot;He lives and will continue to if he learns his place.&quot; If he ever tried to put her back into that dark place again she'd ensure he'd never speak.

He'd read some of the old stories, the prophecies written down - though his master had never been one to keep much of that material around - but he'd never been forced to really think about it like this. And without the familiar tug of his bond to Seyd, everything just felt wrong. &quot;I belong here,&quot; he affirmed. &quot;I belong with Seyd.&quot; Kerigan, meanwhile, was done just listening. This...thing...was talking about a veritable apocalypse, and no matter how much he wanted to stay out of the fights for the rest of his life, he could hardly stay out of one like that. &quot;You wait one damn minute,&quot; he snapped, carefully laying Seyd down so he could approach Zhyal. &quot;You're talking about a civil <i>war</i>.

You are fragile creatures, it would be best for you to understand that your resistance will only bring you more suffering.&quot; She had no sympathy in her eyes for humanity's plight.

It wasn't like he was armed - and even if he was, she'd just tossed Seyd against the shelves like a ragdoll. He was sturdier than the bookish historian, to be sure, but against a creature like this, would it even matter? If she wanted to leave, it seemed, she was going to. But as soon as word got out - and it would, very fast - everything was going to go straight to hell. Still, he didn't budge. Elym's newly freed mind was racing. What was he supposed to do? She had hurt Seyd. She would hurt others. But she was his own kind. His eyes flickered to the book he'd brought over earlier, then to Seyd, and when he finally spoke up, his voice was quiet and almost pained. &quot;...Mihcaloh.&quot; He knew it might not work. Seyd had been the one to awaken her; it might take his voice to subdue her once more.

guardiangodofthekusabanaclan: And Timothy as 3.
guardiangodofthekusabanaclan: And Johnny has none.
guardiangodofthekusabanaclan: Why doesn't Johnny shape up and act like a human so he can have a friend give him one?

science_is_progress: Go take a long walk off a short cliff.
guardiangodofthekusabanaclan: I'd love to see you do that
science_is_progress: The fuck's the matter with you?
science_is_progress: I don't have to like you.

supreme_chlorophile_zetsu: So I think ... &quot;Maybe he's lonely ... But if he really wanted company, he wouldn't treat anyone like this, because as we all know, if you want friends, you have to act like you want them, and not like a stagnant pile of flaming shit.&quot; Which, inevitably makes me woner about you, but then I come to realize ... You either don't want better for yourself, and have become complacent with mediocrity, or that something happened in your recent past to make you push away anyone who wasn't -already- in your circle at the time.

supreme_chlorophile_zetsu: Is an oak
supreme_chlorophile_zetsu: Won't move a budge.
science_is_progress: Because I told you to not type stupid shit?
science_is_progress: Wow, yeah, get help.
supreme_chlorophile_zetsu: I didn't type stupid shit xD
science_is_progress: You're typing stupid shit now.
supreme_chlorophile_zetsu: xD Dude, you need help more than I do ...
supreme_chlorophile_zetsu: Your perception is beyond fucked up
science_is_progress: Riiiiight, I'm the one going all psychotic on a stranger.
science_is_progress: Pretty sure you're the one who is going to end up without any friends if you treat people you don't even know with all this crap.
science_is_progress: But that ain't my problem.
supreme_chlorophile_zetsu: I don't treat -everyone- like this xD
supreme_chlorophile_zetsu: But you're just as pathetic, you know
supreme_chlorophile_zetsu: You're fighting back xD
supreme_chlorophile_zetsu: When you said you were going to ignore me.
science_is_progress: I did ignore you, you switched sns.
science_is_progress: Which made me curious why anyone would try so hard.
supreme_chlorophile_zetsu: So ...
supreme_chlorophile_zetsu: Maybe you can tell me ...
supreme_chlorophile_zetsu: Why a group of people
science_is_progress: But apparently I don't in fact know you so you can't be all that important and this conversation has gone absolutely nowhere except to prove that you are psychotic so yeah, going to ignore you now.

analucia_is_lost: Well, hello there.

james_lsawyerl_ford: Hello there, Lulu.

analucia_is_lost: What's up, cowboy?

james_lsawyerl_ford: -Lowers the smutty romance novel he's read about a half a dozen times already.- Something I can do you for, Pocahontas? 

analucia_is_lost: -Scoffs- ...no. Was just getting some mangoes for Jack. Where's Kate? -arching both brows-. Lost her again? -folding arms across chest with a slight annoyed stance.-

james_lsawyerl_ford: -Purses his lips into a bemused grin.- I ain't her keeper. So you're Jack's mango girl now? 

analucia_is_lost: ...what the hell is that supposed to mean? -Advancing on him slightly.- She's your girlfriend, am I wrong? I'm getting food for *other* people, you're not exactly doing anything. 

james_lsawyerl_ford: -Barks out a laugh.- Kate? Hell, I'd like her to keep my sandy sleeping bag warm at night, but with the choices I got on this here Giligan's Island that ain't saying a whole lot now is it? As for the food, it grows all over, don't see any reason for me to go out and fetch it all when everyone else can do the same. 

analucia_is_lost: You're an asshole, anyone ever tell you that? -She muttered, stopping from advancing on him and just stood there.- It. Never. Happened. -Speaking of their time, how Michael had tried to kill her, and... the whole gun thing.- -Funny thing was, she was the one who told him to keep his mouth shut, and here she was bringing it up.- - Ana frowned, still glaring some-what.-

james_lsawyerl_ford: Well you just did, cupcake. -Has a sneaky suspicion that the ex-cop didn't take too kindly to his nicknames. Good. It meant she wouldn't get too close.- Then again, -he drawled out, head tilting just enough to let hair fall in his face- not like it's the first time I've ever heard that. -Grunts with a shift of his postion, going from his casual recline to standing.- There a reason you're standing in my light?

analucia_is_lost: Truth be told, she was kind of soft. After all, Ana-Lucia had told people to 'give Sawyer her best'. She frowned, tucking back some of her ebony strands behind her ear and looked down at the sand. ""Forget it."" glaring daggers at him with that dark gaze and headed away from him, turning her back on him so he probably could stare at her ass but she didn't care. Funny thing was, they were the only ones that seemed to be around right now. Jack had gone off to play golf with Hurley and Kate, she hadn't heard Claire or Charlie bickering about Aaron. Grabbing onto the messenger bag on the sand, her olive colored hand picked it up and started to go through how much food they had for the day. Like she gave a shit anymore.

james_lsawyerl_ford: Well now wasn't that interesting. Generally he'd just shrug and go back to his reading, or if he was really feeling energetic he might scheme, but he rarely chased after anyone. It was a nice afternoon but that ass was nicer and he always did like a mystery. Since no one else seemed to be around for any entertainment he threw the book down along with his reading glasses and tromped through the sand after the head strong latina. ""Hey now wait one second. *You* came over to *me*, remember? So what's this all about?""

analucia_is_lost: ""If  I said nevermind, it means nevermind."" whirling on him with a fist raised. ""I just wanted to..."" but the Hispanic beauty had no excuse, her eyes stared at him coldly. ""I wanted to see if you'd help...get the mangoes."" what a terrible lie. That was one check mark, her mother would have said she was a terrible liar and it had been the truth after she had tried to say that Jason wasn't the one who had shot her. Hadn't Sawyer seen the scar on her stomach? He had no questions? Ana-Lucia was like a puzzle, she couldn't be figured out...yet it was so easy to put the pieces together. She couldn't kill Benjamin Linus, she couldn't shoot him...she couldn't do this anymore. ""Just c'mere."" Cortez muttered and disappeared off into the foliage.

james_lsawyerl_ford: He rolled his eyes at her blatant lie but if there was one thing he knew it was that people rarely concealed the truth for too long. They let it out in quieter ways than words, if you were smart enough to look for those silent signals you could find out a lot about a person without ever having to ask. Still, there were a lot of pieces to this woman. That alone kept him from ignoring her and returning to his book. ""Alright, Gonzales, I'll help you with your melons."" A purposeful switch of words. Grunting at the bush that was attemping to consume his foot he followed along after yanking it free. ""What's so special about these mangoes, anyway? Don't take two people, not like they can run."" And she had a bag to carry them in, it was a valid question. Plus, he liked to see her lie.

analucia_is_lost: ""Shut up."" she muttered, Ana took the messenger bag off from her persona and set it down on the jungle floor. ""I'm gonna throw them down...and you put them in. Simple enough for you?"" the Latina sassed and already turned her back once again to him, climbing up the tree. Hey, if she could get Bernard down that one time, then she could definitely get mangoes down. ""My melons, are none of your business."" rolling her eyes, getting the joke a little too late considering the brunette had been concentrating on other things. First mango that came down, she threw hopefully smacking him in the head. ""Sorry."" not caring if it hit him or not. Her slender body finally tossed down a few more, despite the messenger bag being half full. Anyone could go and get food, her lies were pretty bad. ""This sucks.""the woman muttered more to herself then him. 

james_lsawyerl_ford: ""Yeah, simple enough,"" he drawled out with a sass of his own. ""Plus, I get to see that police trained ass from here and I don't much like climbing trees."" At least not for the benefit of everyone else. They could get their own damn mangoes for all he cared. Looking up at her climbing figure he should have seen the fruit coming. Perhaps his eyes were just not accustomed to falling fruit as they were to the curves of a lithe woman's figure. Whichever the case, the mango hit him square in the forhead with a resounding crack. Quickly he lifted a hand to the banged spot to rub agrily at it. ""You wanna watch where you're tossing those things?! Ow--goddamn,"" he grumbled, making hissing sounds of pain when he touched the injured spot. He tossed her a glare upwards before swiping up the fruit and stuffing it into the bag. Next time he looked up he had his eyes on the fruit. Hell, that was going to leave a mark.

analucia_is_lost: All it took was one wrong branch and she slid. ""Ah shit."" the tomboy muttered in that rasp, attempting to pull herself back up again, but failed and fell. Ontop of him now, boy the poor guy would have to endure not only falling fruit, but a falling Ana-Lucia. Straddling him, she glared down at him. ""Get off of me."" attempting to get up, but didn't really realize she hand her hands pinning his wrists down. Dark eyes stared down at him, knowing that this was the kind of predicament that she didn't want to be in. Hell, she wasn't even drunk. The young woman had however picked up some Sawyer antics, after all...they were two of a kind. ""Son of a bitch."" she muttered. 

james_lsawyerl_ford: Hell, he knew this had to be a bad idea, but he assumed she'd have better luck than he would up a tree. Guess he was wrong. Luckily enough he saw her slip and had just enough decency to at least try and catch her. The thought was nice but the implementation of it was lacking and they both ended up on the ground. ""You're considerably heavier than a mango, Hot Lips,"" he grunted out between shallow breaths after having the wind knocked out of him. When she ordered him to get off of her he just grinned. ""You're the one top, which is, in my humble observations, the way you like it."" 'So don't complain' was the tone the had. Canting his head to one side he lifted a brow slightly. ""Gonna get up or are you starting to like the view?"" 

analucia_is_lost: Any sane woman would blush, but instead she reeled back a fist hoping to punch him, whether she hit her mark or not didn't matter. ""That's the last time I ask you to help with...my mangoes."" Cortez grit her teeth, this was foolish and oh so stupid. ""Shut up, Sawyer."" crashing her lips down upon his. Her nails made sure to dig into his wrists, the hell she liked it on top. He obviously knew her now. Was it love? She didn't know. Was it hate? Most likely, but there was no gun involved now. Apart of her seemed to wonder if he did really like Kate and back when Jack and Kate had betrayed her and Sawyer had tried to frame her for Sun...well things didn't really go so well together. Especially when he named himself the sheriff, like hell h was the sheriff. Only one cop here and it wasn't him. 

Sawyer: Being a con artist meant you had to see things coming. You had to predict people, read them, understand their motives and drives and plan accordingly. Yet with all his years experience he did *not* see that kiss coming. Not even close. So it probably explained why he was a little too shocked to really kiss back. ""...the hell, Lucy?"" From what he knew about her she didn't care much for him and that had suited him just fine. It seemed the only way he knew how to be with a woman was when he was conning her. This was unfamiliar territory despite all his talk. ""You got a reason why you suddenly felt the need to resuscitate me?""

Ana-Lucia: Furrowing her brows, Ana let go of his wrists and rolled off of him. She was hard to read, and she knew it. ""...you ever wonder...where that scar came from?"" getting up onto her feet. ""You know, the one on my stomach?"" Ana asked, it was just a question. How the hell did he know it would mean anything? So she lifted up the hem of her black tank top and showed him, just at her midriff. ""I was shot..."" letting her gaze flicker back up to meet his. ""On duty."" shrugging her shoulders, it probably meant nothing to him. Absolutely nothing.

Sawyer: Wasn't she just a rollercoaster of confusion? Some might dislike that in a person but Sawyer took it as a challenge. For a moment he just laid there on his back trying to make sense of it all before rolling over onto his side to glance at her stomach when she pointed it out. ""Looks like a gunshot wound to me, sister,"" he agreed. It seemed reasonable that she'd be shot while on duty since she'd been a cop in a previous life. A life before that damnable plane crash. ""So, what was it? Take one for a fellow donut muncher?"" He had such a way with words.

Ana-Lucia: ""I was pregnant."" a faint smile, but it faded. ""I just let him reach...thought he had I.D, yanno? Like he was just a kid. He wasn't."" Ana tilted her head to the side. ""Why am I telling you this?"" scoffing and bent over to grab onto the messenger bag, zipping it up. She watched him however out of the corners of her eyes and saw the way he was just laying there. There was emotion in her eyes, but Cortez wasn't one to cry. Hell she didn't, only for Eko.

Sawyer: Now he felt a little awkward but he wasn't about to let it show. Instead of compassion, an emotion he wasn't entirely familiar with, he simply let out a whistle. ""Whew, momacita, you do have some issues."" He couldn't say he understood because he didn't. He couldn't give her any words of consolation because he didn't know any. The best he could offer was a bit of blithe sarcasm and blunt honesty. ""I don't know why you're telling me this, ain't like I was the one who shot you."" He finally got to his feet. ""Though, I do have a way with guns."" That was given with a wide smirk, still utterly proud of himself for that feat. 

Ana-Lucia: ""Did it occurre to you, that maybe one day...someone would actually like your sorry ass?"" the tomboy sighed, staring at him as she folded her arms across her chest. ""What do you want me to say to you? Yeah, it took a near death experience to ..."" she trailed off. ""Just go find Kate, I'm sorry I tried."" and began to walk off once more. Good lord, she actually had feelings for him. Deep inside, Cortez was screaming, she could just kick herself for this. The woman promised that she'd never like anyone like Danny again, never be happy again. Not after the Others took the kids...not until someone would actually feel the way she did and not just be a hardened leader.

Sawyer: ""Ain't nobody ever has,"" he shot back, ""not the real me, anyhow."" And wasn't that the truth. Sure, he could get women to do just about anything for him but they were always googly eyed for the persona he was putting on for them, not for who he really was. Not a one of them would have stuck around or even given him the time of day if they really knew. Hell, most days he didn't even like himself either. ""Right, go find Kate. Sounds to me like someone here's a little jealous,"" he called out after her. Jealous of what, though? Maybe he'd never figure these women out. With a bemused sigh he ran a hand back through his shaggy hair to get it out of his eyes. 

Ana-Lucia: ""Jealous? You think, someone would actually give two shits if you were a smooth talking, con man? ...boy, I've conned you."" she spoke, now going off on him in Spanish a little. ""I see through you, Sawyer. What the hell is your real name anyway? I gave you mine."" sarcasm. Wouldn't it be funny if she actually knew back when she had been Christian's body guard that she had hit Sawyer with the car door, how ironic. ""What are you hiding from?"" now there was emotion in her tone. ""This cat and mouse game, cute as it is. ..."" furrowing her brows. She wasn't one to run away from things, it was either take it by full force or get rid of it. 

Sawyer: ""Look, Princess, you're the one who kissed me, alright? Not the other way around. You don't like me? Fine. You like me? Fine. This here ain't no Temptation Island."" With the question as to his real name he paused with a deep frown. Now that was just territory no one really deserved to go into. ""I don't see how that's any of your business, I never asked you to tell me your name so it ain't like I owe you mine."" And besides that, information was expensive and he didn't think she had the currency for it. 

Ana-Lucia: ""I kissed you to get a gun."" Ana-Lucia countered, clearly not amused with the situation. ""But you're afraid, aren't you? It's none of my business? Bull shit, you're not telling me anything because you're too much of a pussy to tell the truth. You play it like you're hardcore but you don't even know what that means."" words were cold, always cold. She started to walk away, just as the sound of the baby was heard in the distance. Baby Aaron. Claire was probably up and about by now, where the hell had everyone gone? ""Good game, Jack."" Kate smirked, the doctor just looked like he could cry, always. ""I almost beat you."" he nodded with a smirk. 

Sawyer: He stared her down with a fierce furrowing of his brows. That bitch. Alright, she wanted to play a game she was going to have a tough time winning. ""Oh and I suppose you do?"" He countered back to her claim that he didn't know the meaning of hardcore. Maybe he didn't but he sure as all hell didn't think she knew any better. ""You think one little gun is going to protect you?"" He stepped forward, angry now that she'd gotten one up on him, and did his damnedest to look intimidating. ""You can either give it back or I'll take it back, comprende?"" He could hear the others of their group in the distance but he didn't give one damn. This was none of their goddamn business. 

Ana-Lucia: Well, an ideal thing to say was 'over her dead body' but somehow she didn't think that was appropriate. It didn't occur to him that maybe he wasn't the only tortured soul on the island. ""Not to protect me, but to kill him, Jackass."" Ana said loudly so anyone could hear them. Though no one did, they were pretty far into the jungle. ""You're not getting it back. Now, step off."" turning to look at him, as if willing him to fight her. She could beat his ass and beat it hard. ""Punching isn't the only thing I'm good at."" though it did help. 

Sawyer: ""Oh so now you've gone from glorified donut muncher to bonified vig-eye-lantee,"" he was intrigued but not enough to hand over a gun without something in return as payment. ""Ain't it something what time on a deserted island will do for someone's civilized nature."" He stepped closer, getting within arms reach despite her threat of punching he could take a hit. ""Now, Muchacha, you're going to hand that gun back over. I ain't opposed to hitting a woman if she deserves it."" He didn't particularly like hitting women but she didn't need to know that.

Ana-Lucia: ""Or what? What are you going to do, hit me?"" she growled, having to take off the messenger bag and tossed it to the side. Readying her fist, and swung. She had other things up her sleeve. ""You're not getting it back."" shoving him onto the ground, whether the fist hit or not. She straddled him, and this time it wasn't for fun. raising a hand once more, to smack him upside the head. If he turned the tables on her she was screwed.

Sawyer: ""Yeah I just mi--"" he was cut off mid retort by a fist he captured with one hand. Now to either keep his word and hit her while she was vulnerable or simply try to subdue her without much violence. He didn't get much of a choice. She'd thrown her weight into it and with his footing not prepared for the shift of their bodies he toppled back to the ground with her weighing down on his waist again. ""If I didn't know any better, sweetcheeks, I'd say you just like having me on my back all--"" he had to stop his commentary to deal with another swing. ""Goddamnit woman, you want me to hit you?!"" While she was busy with that endeavor he attempted to reach for her waist, sure that she probably stashed the gun away there. At the very least it was worth a shot."

"event","I&nbsp;can't seem to get off the ground just yet for Nano, but Jack would like to see what I've gotten so far. Here it is in all it's raw glory.


Decorated in the unmistakeably bright orange of the X-wing pilot's jumpsuit, Wedge Antilles shifted his vigilant stance. In the hangar bay which berthed Rogue Squadron's array of X-Wing fighters stood along the far wall a line of holostatues. Guardians, ever watchful, of the pilots who prepped themselves down below on the hangar's floor below. Captain Antilles made it a habit, or more like a ritual if his wing-men were asked to describe it, of standing in front of each of their transparent faces to look them in the eyes giving them his silent promise that he would not join their ranks until he'd seen the last of their sacrifices fulfilled. 

It would be easy for a man to get swallowed up in the responsibility and weight of being a survivor; too easy to regret living in the face of those who had paid a heavy price. Shifting along to the next in line the stalwart leader held back a flinch. Biggs. The one face he was reluctant to revisit on these occasions. It was Biggs, ironically, who reminded him that for every time he returned from a close fought skirmish he kept his cockpit free of another soul who would be sent to stand in the line of fire. Each time the Rogues were successful lives were spared; even when lives were spent in the process. 

Reflections were better suited for another time when he could have the luxury of indulging in senseless guilt. While his eyes scanned over familiar faces his resolve forged itself into steel upon sight of the news ones added to the list. Luke talked about anger as if it was a force capable of being controlled, Wedge was beginning to doubt that the Jedi fully knew what he was talking about. Maybe for a Jedi that level of control was possible, but for the average man it seemed like a task that was growing more impossible by the day. 

There was an unmistakable sound of boots clicking along the catwalk to his right, but they carried a distinct stately air rather than the rugged shuffle of flight boots. It was pure instinct, rather than a predisposition to the Force, that had Wedge wheeling around with one hand easily gliding to his hip where the comforting weight of a blaster sat off to one side."

Any way, to the AW&nbsp;SHIT&nbsp;part. Nano is in four days and I&nbsp;still have no real antagonist. Sure&nbsp; I know what he's going to be up to for plot purposes but I don't even know what RACE&nbsp;he is let alone what he LOOKS like or even his NAME. FUCK.

It may just be easier to create my own race that fits what I'm looking for instead of trying to sift through all the Star Wars canon for what I want. I&nbsp;know I want his political structure from the sector he's from to be accustomed to assassinations and political infighting as the norm. If you hold a political position of power you are expected to maintain that power and if you get yourself killed by an ambitious aide, well that was your own damn fault and you didn't deserve to have that office. Since they will be new to the fledgling Republic they have some getting used to in terms of the New Republic's government, which will make the situation even more sticky. To pile onto that, whatever his constituents are they bring in something very valuable to the Republic, something they wouldn't want to just toss aside for the Empire to scoop back up.

"event","Part of an RP story line, but Dacon's all by his lonesome so I'm using Lj to fill in on what he's been up to.<br /><br /><lj-cut>It was a wonder what the body could become accustomed to. And for that matter what any species' body could become acclimated with. The light sensitive spice had to be mined in complete darkness, which never helped when faced with what *made*&nbsp;the spice. Sure, Dacon had tried it once in the academy (who hadn't?) but he hadn't known then that it came out of a spider's backside. An energy spider at that, one which could suck the life energy straight out of a full grown man in less than a few seconds flat. His eyes had become used to the dark but his ears would never get used to those <em>screams.&nbsp;</em><br /><br />Even with the Force as his ally Dacon had trouble fitting in with the work routine. Hours upon hours in a dirt filled tunnel pressed up against your nearest, and usually smelly, neighbor while fingers dug through grit and rock looking for thin tendrils. All the while the mind stayed alert, wary for the slightest movement or sound that could serve as a warning. It rarely ever made the difference. Luckily with his ability to sense his surroundings, Dacon had the advantage. It still didn't help sleep any better at night.<br /><br />If this is what life had become he was sure he didn't want any more part in it. How long had it been anyway since he was caught flatfooted by that damn merc? A&nbsp;month? A&nbsp;year? Without a sun or any means of telling time it could have very well been years though he could still remember what the outside world looked like so it couldn't have been too long. Either way, he knew he didn't belong there and had been in long enough to know no one was going to come for him. And why should they? He had been the one to leave and he had known the consequences. Truth be told he thought he was above capture; that overconfidence was kicking him in the ass.<br /><br />Nothing bit as hard as spice. After a foolhardy attempt at freedom Dacon had slipped and let his abilities show. If there was one thing the galaxy had a temerity toward it would be the Jedi. Some approached them with fear and hostility, others with fear but a begrudging respect. The slave drivers of Kessel fell into the former category. A Jedi was a liability in the caves. The first dose was a treat. A reprieve from sore back muscles and aching limbs. A vacation from blood chilling screams into brief but intense pleasure and awareness. It was as if the world opened up into limitless possibilities, but one by one those possibilities flickered out like dying pinpricks of stars out in the distance.<br /><br />After his sixth treatment with the unrefined spice (the refining process was where all the money came into the cost of production and why waste good spice on a slave?) the pleasure was no longer appealing. Dacon never got the name of his sector's chief but if he knew it he'd spit it as a curse until the day he died. Spice intoxication was a slow process and the beginnings far more enjoyable than any man trying to teach a lesson could bear to watch. One by one he brought them in. Murderers, psychotic killers with a lust for bloodshed and a penchant for finding the most unimaginable ways of going about it. There was no control over the spice's influence, no filter and no direction to point the opened awareness in. Their minds were laid open, every thought and every sick pleasure they took became his thoughts and his sick pleasures. Except that they weren't, and some small part of his drugged mind knew it. <br /><br />If time had been an elusive blur in the tunnels it was now a concept he couldn't grasp. It could have been eons that he spent in that hazy mist of swirling memories that weren't his own and thoughts he'd never think. Piecing his own life back together was a chore and every time they hauled him from his shift he knew he only had precious moments of instant clarity before it all went back to nothing comprehensible. One thought stuck out from all of the rest. One blazing and unforgettable image that almost pulsed in his mind with a life energy all its own. That one speck of recognition he clung to with everything he had. He could already feel the situation getting desperate as more and more of his sense of self crumbled under the weight of crushing disorientation brought on by the drug. This time he harnessed the drug's effects and remembered for a brief moment about the Force.<br /><br />Perhaps that moment was truly that, just a fraction of a second in time, or perhaps it was a full minute or more. He'd never know. All of his focus and concentration went into that image and reached for that pulse of life somewhere far away from here. He reached out and called to her, miraculously remembering her name. <em>Jovi! Jovi help me, please! Jovi he-</em> Whatever clarity had been there quickly eroded away, and for today he was a butcher. He'd wake up in the morning in a fog, not remembering why his throat felt so raw; not remembering that he spent the previous night screaming. </lj-cut><br />"

Did he care?</span></font><br /><br /> <br /></span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&ldquo;<font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">No, Gabe.&rdquo; It was my final word on the matter.</span></font><br /><br /> <br /></span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">But when did Gabriel ever let that stop him?</span></font><br /><br /> <br /></span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p><span style=""font-size: small;""><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&ldquo;<font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">I've had it with you and your self imposed punishment. It doesn't matter how much normal blood you drink you're always going to need some of mine from now on. I've accepted that, why can't you do the same?&rdquo;</span></font></p> </span><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><br /> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&ldquo;<font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Because you have </span><i>no idea</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> how it makes me feel and you </span><i>never</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> will. So why don't you just drop it, I'm not drinking from you and I can tell when you try and mix it in with my supply. I'd really rather not waste another batch because you've decided to go on some fool's mission to make me want to do things your way.&rdquo; I really wasn't going to have any of it but Gabriel had to go and do something extremely misguided and foolish. </span></font> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><br /> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">I smelled the blood the instant the wound hit air and every particle of my being ached to taste it. He knew I hadn't had any wolf's blood in weeks. He </span><i>knew</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> it. I was at a loss whether to just leave the room or strangle him for being so reckless but I could do neither as I sat in silence while the couch shifted to accept the weight of the foolhardy wolf. </span></font> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><br /> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&ldquo;<font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Gabriel...&rdquo; to my own ears that sounded like a plea and though my pride stung I could only hope Gabe heard the same. </span></font> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><br /> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&ldquo;<font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Stop fighting me on this, I know I'm right. You just need to trust me.&rdquo; </span></font> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><br /> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">The smell was stronger than ever and I knew Gabe was holding his wrist close to my face. My arms felt sluggish yet I couldn't stop their rise to clutch onto his arm and draw the slight wound to my lips. Just a taste nearly sent my mind reeling off the edge. I felt my body shudder and in that moment all I knew was that I wanted more. </span></font> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><br /> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">The thing about wolf's blood is that once you have a taste you can hardly stop yourself from getting more. I lunged for Gabriel's neck but thankfully I had enough sense of self to spare him any violence on my part. His head hit the pillow at the other end of the couch and I was on top of him, fangs burying quickly and efficiently into his neck to draw out twin wells of blood. Life giving blood. Energy coursed through my veins as the warm and thick substance absorbed into my body teetering on the ledge between living and dead. </span></font> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><br /> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">He clutched at my arm and I sucked harder, determining to get my fill and be done with it. With a force of will I brought my head up and licked at the two punctures until they closed. Too late for Gabriel now to back out of this, he'd open the flood gates and I wasn't even sure I could stop even if I tried. So much for that shirt too, my fingers clawed it right off his body. And where those moans I heard in pleasure or pain? I hadn't meant to catch skin with my nails. </span></font> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><br /> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Gabriel must have sensed my hesitation. &ldquo;Don't stop now...I...I really don't mind.&rdquo; </span></font> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><br /> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Was I hearing him right? He didn't </span><i>mind</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> a little abuse? This was a slippery slope I was standing on. On the one hand it was hot to hear Gabe moan like that from just a few scratches but on the other if he enjoyed it too much I could honestly hurt Gabriel and that was never something I wanted to let myself do. Then again, Gabriel wasn't some hapless human who didn't know what he was getting himself involved with. If push came to shove the wolf was more than capable of defending himself until one of them could come to their senses. </span></font> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><br /> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">My tongue found its way to those scrapes and pressed hard as it licked up whatever coppery tasting blood it could find. Both of my hands were pinning Gabriel's arms back almost as if they had a will of their own, and the wolf's moans only fanned the flames. So the little potter liked to be held down? This was new, but somehow not all that surprising to me. I could certainly work with it in the mood that I was in. A little shifting brought the fact of just how much of a mood to my attention...and to Gabriel's. Nothing like a month of abstinence to make me just a little trigger happy. </span></font> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><br /> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Even in my heated state I knew the couch wasn't going to be the best location for what I wanted to do next with Gabe. &ldquo;Up,&rdquo; I commanded simply, doing the same to get off the couch. I could feel Gabriel moving along beside me but we never made it to the bedroom. Just inside the hallway I had him pinned to the wall, my hungry lips on his pressing our mouths together in a fierce embrace. Each hand found their counterpart's wrist on Gabriel and held them to the wall above his head. I was hungry, but this time not for blood. When I shifted my hips to his I could feel that I wasn't alone. </span></font> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><br /> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&ldquo;<font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Haa...&rdquo; we hissed in unison. </span></font> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><br /> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&ldquo;<font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">You're a lot kinkier than I imagined,&rdquo; I breathed into one ear, my lips next moving to the wolf's neck as I was so fond of doing. I knew how much it got to him. </span></font> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><br /> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">&ldquo;<font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Heh...nngh...the things you find out when you quit arguing with me.&rdquo; </span></font> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><br /> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Well, he had a point and I wasn't about to take the time to argue with him about it. Not right now at least. &ldquo;Yeah, I'll try and keep that in mind,&rdquo; my voice strained into an ear. If normal blood made me antsy wolf blood made me downright voracious. My darker elements were boiling, a reason I hate feeding from Gabe. How could someone so damn </span><i>good</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> turn me into someone so damn </span><i>evil</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">? Well perhaps not evil, but I felt damn close. </span></font> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><br /> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p><span style=""font-size: small;""><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><i>That little wolf had asked for it</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">. My hands switched positions up a little, transferring one wrist to the other so that it could dive freely down and go for the latches of Gabe's pants. No time for romance, I'm on the clock and I'll be damned if I lose an opportunity. Our tune changed with my body pressing up to his and I could notice the distinct discomfort of cloth between skin. Gabe wasn't going anywhere so my hands changed direction and started on my own shirt, prying apart the damnable buttons one by one until I could completely shrug it off. Silk didn't belong on the floor but there it would stay followed by my slacks for the remainder of the night.</span></font></p> </span><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><br /> </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">There weren't any words, I simply pushed myself to him and let my hungry lips do all the talking in silence. Well, </span><i>relative </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">silence. Gabriel made enough noise for the both of us when skin met skin. I'm sure the wall wasn't entirely comfortable but Gabriel wasn't complaining. </span></font> </span></p></lj-cut><br /><br />"

"event","I blame you Ran. I&nbsp;truly do. <br /><br />Just my own creation stuff. First off is the base materials and then the elements which get mixed in to give the Golems their traits. I&nbsp;may bring in a precious stones/gem section to give the Golems even more customizability and powers. <br /><br /><u><strong>Golemology:</strong></u><br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><u>Main base ingredients</u></div><br /><u>Clay</u><br /><br /><strong>Kaolin</strong> - A very robust material that lends the Golem made from it with a higher degree of strength, yet it is not the most maleable and must be cast carefully or will come out looking malformed. This is a better suited base material for indestinct Golem shapes used for mostly guarding and security purposes rather than more skilled and dexterous tasks. The humanoid class of Golems are not generally made out of this type of clay due to the extreme difficulty of adding detail. <br /><br /><strong>Fire Clay</strong> - A reddish hued clay that is easier to work with than Kaolin, mostly. It leaves the Golem with a red tint. Despite the name it does not imbue the Golem with any fire elemental powers or resistance. <br /><br /><strong>Earthenware</strong> - A clay that contains fairly high concentrations of iron giving it a greater strength. Used primarily for the giant Golems who take on an almost earth elemental appearance, often mistaken for boulders when they are at rest. Useful for moving large amounts of earth for building as well as for defense. <br /><br /><strong>Stoneware</strong> - As the name implies this clay is the strongest of its class. Used for Golems where strength is a priority. Usually leaves a dullish grey hue to the Golems made from it though other pigmentation may be added. <br /><br /><strong>Porcelain</strong> - The clay most often employed when making humanoid Golems. It is a difficult substance to work with having very low plasticity and therefore requires a high level of dedication and perserverance to make a detailed humanoid Golem from. The Golem's &quot;skin&quot; tone can vary depending on pigmentation, if added. If no pigmentation is added the Golem will have extremely pale and smooth &quot;skin&quot;. It is not a very strong substance and is thus not a first choice for Golems needed in protection or military situations.<br /><br /><u>Metals</u><br /><br /><strong>Gold </strong>- A very expensive base material to start with and a very weak one at that. Generally used only by the extremely wealthy and only for servant purposes. Being that Gold Powder is also used to imbue a Golem with intellect and self-awareness these Golems also possess such qualities. This makes them useful as scholars in simple tasks or assistants and servants. A gold Golem is extremely rare owing to the fact that a great deal of gold is required in order to mold the shape desired. <br /><br /><strong>Silver</strong> - Another expensive and weak metal. Since Silver Dust is used to give a Golem an attachment to the magical realm these Golems inherently possess such a power. They are commonly used as wizard assistants or on the battlefield casting offensive or protective spells from a distance. They are also costly to make and thus rare.<br /><br /><strong>Iron</strong> - A very strong and common material making the Golems formed from it very formidable in battle. Can be made into many shapes to fit the desired need. When humanoid they are not often given many details as they are generally used for combat and do not need to be asthetically pleasing. <br /><br /><strong>Bronze</strong> - Not as strong as Iron but the Golems made from this alloy look more stately and official yet cost less than gold and are not by default self-aware and intelligent. They make for good guards of estates. <br /><br /><div style=""text-align: left;""><u>Natural Products</u></div><br /><strong>Wood</strong> - A variety of sources and utlities make this an ideal choice for Golems to be used as grunts. Different trees can imbue these Golems with different strengths but they all have a similar weakness: fire. They burn quickly and are therefore not ideal for use anywhere fire may be a hazard. They are relatively cheap to make and if you are a skilled craftsman they can be as detailed as the creator sees fit. <br /><br /><strong>Plant Life</strong> - Harder to sculpt than most materials, these Golem generally are more amorphous in design and their plants retain a lifelike quality. Vines can be employed as snares and they make for good traps in wooded locales or places heavy in foliage. <br /><br /><strong>Cadavers</strong> - A more grotesque material used primarily by those with the intent to strike fear by using body parts in order to form their Golems. Necromancers seem to favor this method and it is ubiquitously thought of as evil. <br /><br /><strong>Animal Remains</strong> - Also a very Necromatic trait. These Golems can be a mixing of animal parts and generally are quite grotesque.<br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><u>The Elements</u></div><br /><strong>Antimony</strong> - A metalloid substance that resembles a metal in appearance and physical properties yet does not react chemically like a metal. Added to a Golem's constitution antimony generates a more wildlike nature and animalistic qualities. Best served for guard 'dog' like Golems or for when you have need for a mixture of power and a hunter's skill. <br /><br /><strong>Arsenic</strong> - A notoriously poisonous metalloid substance. While deadly to humans it has no such effect on Golems. It has three allotropic forms; yellow, black, and grey. The yellow form grants intellect and clarity of mind, giving the Golem a higher level of intelligence. The black form commands mastery from the Golem, making it capable of mastering specific skills dependent on the Will of its creator and the Design it was made in. The grey form of arsenic is a balancing agent and is used often in the more humanoid forms of Golems to stabilize their &quot;psyche&quot;. <br /><br /><strong>Copper </strong>- A red hued metal notoriously linked to Venus/Aphrodite. The addition of copper to a Golem can imbue it with beauty and artistic creativity. Often used by the alchemists seeking to restore a former lover to life. <br /><br /><strong>Gold</strong> - A very expensive transition metal and one of the most valued elements. The addition of this element grants the Golem self-awareness and perfection of mind. It allows a Golem to act in the interests of its Creator without having to be explicitly commanded. Good for when the Creator does not have the time or the desire to dole out every command but would rather the Golem intuitively learn the Will of its Creator and follow it through with a limited amount of free-thinking. It does not grant a Golem free-will as this is impossible to do. <br /><br /><strong>Iron</strong> - a very common metal and believed to be the tenth most abundant in the known universe. Adding iron to a Golem gives it physical strength and more male character and energy. <br /><br /><strong>Lead</strong> - a bluish-white metal. Lead will give a Golem an understanding of the philosophies and when combined with gold will lead a Golem to a greater understanding of Self and what it is to be a Golem. Not a very widely used combination for the more mechanical Golems as they have no need to ponder on the meaning of life. For scholarly assistants this combination is highly preferred. <br /><br /><strong>Magnesium</strong> - a flammable metal when in thin strips and once ignited it is difficult to extinguish. As such this metal gives the Golem a near infinite life flame, making it difficult to destroy. A very sought after material for soldier Golems.<br /><br /><strong>Mercury</strong> - A metal that is liquid at room temperature. When added to a Golem Mercury gives it a significant increase in mental speed, able to process multiple sources of information at once along with storing information. Useful for the scholars who wish to have a personal database walking beside them which can easily and quickly retrieve stored information at the Command of its Creator. <br /><br /><strong>Phosphorous</strong> - Represents spiritual illumination. Adding phosphorous to a Golem ties it to its maker through Spirit, giving the Creator a greater degree of freedom in control of his/her Golem. Combined with gold it will grant a Golem a very perceptive nature, often anticipating commands before even the Creator realizes that he wishes it done. <br /><br /><strong>Platinum</strong> - Imbues the Golem with perserverence and a greater endurance. A choice element for Golems designed for a specific task that they will doggedly persue until either it is completed or they are utterly destroyed. <br /><br /><strong>Salt </strong>- A required component for Golem creation. Being seen as the base matter, salt is used as a base component believed to be neccessary in the combination of other ingredients. <br /><br /><strong>Silver</strong> - Another of the expensive metals though it is less costly and rare as gold. Silver is used to give a Golem intuition, inner wisdom, and contemplation. Most sought after by the scholars for use in their Golem assistants for the task of research that can be done independently of the Creator. <br /><br /><strong>Sulfur</strong> - A yellow crystalline solid that when added to a Golem gives it something that could be akin to a soul. The symbol for sulfur represents the triad of ascention which can be viewed as a holy trinity. Sulfur is a necessary ingredient in Golemology to bring the Golem to &quot;life&quot;. Without it the Golem remains a machine with no ability to move other than when commanded to do so. Varying amounts of sulfur will have varying effects. A small amount will give 'life' to a Golem but leave it a drone whereas a high concentration of sulfur will give the Golem the same sense of right and wrong as the Creator has. <br /><br /><strong>Tin</strong> - Another necessary element for creating a Golem. Being ruled by Jupiter this element is often associated with the Breath of Life. Without it no Golem can even be animated in the first place, whether as a simple machine or as a more complex 'individual'. <br />"

	</style> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0.2in;"">&quot;All systems are a go. Ensign Vadi, status update?&quot; The senior officer on this two-man experiment turned in his pilot's chair to give a sidelong glance at the Bajoran born Ensign sitting beside him at the engineering controls. <br /><br />&quot;Narib, sir.&quot; If the boy's nose could crinkle any further it might have at being called by his first name. A common mistake made by almost all non-Bajoran's. <br /><br />&quot;Excuse me, Ensign?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;It's Ensign Narib, Sir, Vadi is my first name. It's an old Bajoran custom my parents couldn't quite give up on.&quot; There were <i>a lot</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> of old customs his parents weren't too keen on giving up on. Starfleet had been a welcomed escape from tradition, but he still kept to the name order of his people. </span></p> <p>&quot;Ensign Narib then, I&nbsp;still want that status update.&quot; Narib, Vadi, whatever, he'd sort out the name later when this test was over and done with. There was already enough to think about as they prepped the class 7 shuttle for it's first trial run of the new transwar technology. <br />&nbsp;</p><lj-cut><p>&quot;Ah, right, Lieutenant. Antimatter injectors are at optimal temperatures and alignments, magnetic field is operating on peak efficiencies.&rdquo; Narib's fingers worked dizzyingly over the console bringing up system report after system report. He may not have all the social graces the his people were once known for, but he could be one hell of an engineer. &ldquo;No discrepancies in the field modulation waves. Engineering systems check out, we're all set for phase 1.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Good. Then buckle up, Kansas is going to be a long ways away.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Sir?&quot; Kansas was on Earth, right? He wasn't all that knowledgeable on Earth geography, probably due to falling asleep during that class at the Academy, but he did know enough to know they weren't anywhere near Kansas at the moment.<br /><br />&quot;It's an old Earth story, never mind. When we get back I'll show it to you.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I'll look forward to it, Sir.&quot; Not really, but what else was he supposed to say? <i>Sorry Sir, but Earth literature bores the hell out of me.</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">? </span><br /><br />&quot;<em>Saratoga</em>, this is shuttle 01, all systems have checked out.&nbsp;We are a go for phase 1 testing.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Vela<em>, status confirmed. Initiate Phase 1.</em>&quot; The voice of their captain came in load and clear from the comm. Just the words they were waiting for. Time to make some history.<br /><br />&quot;Acknowledged, <em>Saratoga</em>.&quot; Lieutenant Desmond turned to give a lopsided grin. Piloting a Miranda class science vessel was all well and good as a job, but it was often quite boring. Piloting a shuttle refitted with a transwarp drive, now that was what he'd call exciting. &quot;Well, here goes...something. Start us out at warp 1, Ensign. Let's not get too hasty.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;All readings normal, Lieutenant,&rdquo; Narib piped up after reaching the designated warp speed. It was a very conservative number but if his senior officer wanted to start it off slow he had the prerogative to do so. <br /><br />&quot;Alright, give her a little more gas.&quot; Again that smile crept onto Lieutenant Desmond's face, this promised to be the ride of a lifetime. He was only too happy to volunteer. <br /><br />&quot;Gas, Sir?&quot; Desmond was a good officer, but he'd be damned if he could follow the man's lingo.<br /><br />&quot;Old expression,&rdquo; he explained with more of a mental shrug than a physical one. &ldquo;Vehicles on Earth used to use a hydrocarbon based fuel to run. Really inefficient way to get around.&rdquo; Seeming to switch back over from the brief history lesson the Lieutenant gave his next order, &ldquo;give it more power, take us up to warp 2.5 and then initiate the transwarp drive.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Warp 2.5, yes Sir. Initiating transwarp drive...&rdquo; space seemed to distort into a greenish haze in front of the small craft as Ensign Narib continued to give his observational report, &ldquo;aperture opening ahead...&rdquo; slowly they approached the waving portal into faster-than-warp space, &ldquo;we're in the conduit, Sir.&rdquo;</p>  <p>&ldquo;Well that wasn't so bad, Starfleet made it out to sound like we were taking on the impossible. After the Excelsior I guess I can't blame them.&rdquo; Desmond let himself lean back into the shuttle's pilot's chair, rocking just enough to give himself a very casual and laid back demeanor. &ldquo;How are our shield harmonics holding up?&rdquo;</p>  <p>Narib hit a few keys to bring up the proper readout. &ldquo;Stable. Warp core frequencies rising but not to maximum levels. Dilithium matrix is holding steady. We're approaching infinite velocity.&rdquo; They were approaching something that had only been theorized and never actually reached. Narib could feel his pulse rising just as the numbers began to run up the scale. They had already surpassed conventional warp speeds.</p>  <p>&ldquo;Good work, Ensign. Now about that Kansas. Look up The Wizard of Oz when you get the chance, if Earth literature is your thing. Y'see this girl and her dog get sucked up by a tornado in Kansas and end up in another world. My hand to god, there were midget men and flying monkeys. Hell, even a&mdash;&ldquo; Before the lieutenant could explain what other strange phenomena were in this land of Oz, the shuttle gave a jarring shake that had both men alert at their consoles and typing furiously away at the keys. &ldquo;What the <i>hell</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> was that?!&rdquo;</span></p>  <p>&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;"">I'm not sure! Trying to compensate for the frequency variations...&rdquo; Narib's eyes scanned the numbers and his well versed technical mind came up with an answer neither of them would like. &ldquo;I can't! We're going to shake apart!&rdquo;</span></p>  <p>&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;"">Slow back to normal warp speeds, close the conduit!&rdquo; Aborting wasn't really the way Desmond approached life but at these speeds they couldn't risk a mistake. </span></p>  <p>&ldquo;I can't! The computer is overloading trying to make up for the frequency variance, I can't draw enough power to shut down the transwarp drive.<span style=""font-style: normal;""> These computers weren't made to make this many calculations, there shouldn't even </span><i>be</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> this many fluctuations.&rdquo; It was as if space itself were warping around them and the resonance effect would build until it ripped the hull apart. It was the same problem every ship faced when it tried to enter the transwarp conduits produced by the transwarp drive. Apparently recent modifications had yet to compensate for this effect.</span></p>  <p>&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;"">Keep your head, Ensign. What'll happen if we just eject the core?&rdquo;  It was an option, wasn't it? Frankly he didn't enjoy the prospect of a warp core breach while being trapped inside of transwarp space. Though he had to wonder how far his atoms would be flung across the galaxy. </span></p>  <p>&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;"">I...we'd drop back to normal space, but the deceleration alone would probably rip the hull to shreds. Not to mention the inertial dampeners aren't going to be able to compensate effectively.&rdquo; In short it was a bad idea. It was never the speed that killed it you, it was the sudden stop. </span></p>  <p>&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;"">Boost shields then, we don't have much else in options.&rdquo; Unless Narib here had any bright ideas he wasn't sharing. Now would be the opportune time to speak up. </span></p>  <p>&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;"">Aye Sir. Boosting integrity shields. It'll take a minute but I think I can override the deflector shields and boost our structural integrity by a little.&rdquo; It wouldn't be by much, deflector shields were designed to protect against weapon's fire and debris, their harmonics were very different from the internal ones that held a ship together, but it might work.</span></p>  <p>&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;"">Do it, but do it fast. We're already starting to lose antimatter containment. We've got about a minute until it won't matter if we eject the core or not.&rdquo; Because if it blew in close enough proximity to the shuttle the resonance effect would be the least of their worries.</span></p>  <p>&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;"">That's all I can do,&rdquo; Narib sighed, they'd know if it was enough in just a few seconds, &ldquo;preparing to eject the warp core. Hold on to something.&rdquo; He followed his own advice after keying in the correct eject sequencing code. Both arms went crosswise over his chest gripping onto the straps at each shoulder as the shuttle bucked hard, colliding with the deteriorating wall of the transwarp conduit field. </span></p>  <p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">The ensuing lurch hurled the tiny craft off course, spiraling through pace at a high rate of speed. Narib felt himself pressed so far into his seat he was sure he'd exit out the back and he was glad he couldn't muster enough force to open his eyelids. The ship's on-board inertia dampeners were frantically trying to keep up with the g's they were pulling but only halfway managed to compensate. If they ever came to a safe stop he was sure he'd be losing what was left of his lunch. At the moment he was mercifully unable to even breathe, let alone do anything else. </span></p>  <p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Luck, or perhaps fate, or even the Prophets kept their course from intersecting with a star or a planetoid and given enough time they began to slow to manageable speeds. Once he could move them, his arms untangled themselves from his chest and sent his fingers to the control board. &ldquo;Thrusters are operational,&rdquo; he gasped, finally able to get some air into his lungs. &ldquo;Putting them on reverse, we should be slowing to a stop in a few minutes.&rdquo; Already they were beginning to come to a stop and the engineer pealed himself from the seat. There was still work to do. &ldquo;We're losing structural integrity, our hull shielding is only at 20%&rdquo; At 15% they'd be lucky to stay in one piece. Any less than that would be very uncomfortable. </span></p>  <p>&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;"">Ergh, yeah,&rdquo; Desmond groaned, pealing himself out of his protective position. He may like to go fast but coming to a stop that quickly wasn't really his idea of fun. It </span><i>was</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> an exciting ride, he'd give it that much. &ldquo;Work on getting those shields stabilized, I'll try and find out where the hell we are and contact Starfleet...&rdquo; to let them know this test was a complete failure. Well, perhaps not complete. They were still alive, that had to count for something. </span></p>  <p>&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;"">Aye Sir.&rdquo; Walking felt very unusual after all of those g's but after a misstep or two he made it to the rear of the shuttle and opened the panel affixed to the port wall. The computers had drained nearly all their reserve energy just to keep the ship from ripping itself apart, he'd have to do the overrides manually if he wanted to divert what remaining power they had to the shields. A shuttle just wasn't made for these kinds of conditions, but it was holding up better than expected. </span></p>  <p>&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;"">To any and all starfleet vessels, this is the shuttlecraft </span><i>Vela</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">. We are requesting immediate assistance.&rdquo; Well, that was the best he could do. Sensors were off line and it was a small miracle that the comm seemed to still be operational. </span></p>  <p>&ldquo;<i>Shuttlecraft</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> Vela</span><i>, this is the </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Peregrine</span><i>, please standby we are en route to your position. What is your status?</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">&rdquo;</span></p>  <p>&ldquo;<i>Peregrine</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, it's really good to hear a friendly voice right about now. We've been shaken up a bit, our containment shields are failing and I'm afraid there isn't much left of the hull to keep us comfy if they do. About how long until you arrive? We're a little time critical at the moment.&rdquo; </span></p>  <p>&ldquo;<i>Acknowledged, </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Vela</span><i>, we will at your coordinates in approximately half an hour. Can your shields hold out until then?</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">&rdquo;</span></p>  <p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Well, what were they going to do if they couldn't? Not make the trip at all to save them a wasted thirty minutes? Desmond pushed aside the annoyance. &ldquo;I think we can hold out that long but I wouldn't take any detours along the way if I were you.&rdquo; </span></p>  <p>&ldquo;<i>We will be there as fast as reasonably possible, </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Vela</span><i>. </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Peregrine </span><i>out</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">.&rdquo; </span></p>  <p>&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;"">Did he sound a little snippy to you?&rdquo; Desmond wasn't an engineer, he was a pilot, so with navigation out of commission there wasn't much else for him to do than make small talk.</span></p>  <p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Narib, on the other hand, </span><i>was</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> and engineer and at the moment he was doing some very intricate and sensitive work on the ship's energy conduits. &ldquo;I wasn't paying attention.&rdquo; Which was the truth.</span></p>  <p>&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;"">Yeah, well, he sounded pretty snippy to me.&rdquo; Now what? Was he just going to have to sit here for another thirty minutes? It could be worse, he supposed. The next twenty minutes were uneventful. Narib was still fiddling with the circuitry and Desmond had given up on watching the energy fluctuation that were the result of that fiddling. He couldn't honestly determine if the engineer was making any progress at all, but since the hull hadn't imploded in around them he assumed something productive was going on. Out of boredom his eyes swept back over the energy readouts just in time to see the line dipping down into the red, their next target was Narib in the aft of the shuttle.</span></p>  <p>&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;"">Hey! We're losing power, I thought that was the </span><i>opposite</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> of what we were aiming for here.&rdquo; He had a right to be a little jumpy, the groan from stressed metal was getting to him.</span></p>  <p>&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;"">I know!&rdquo; Narib snapped back, he wasn't an idiot and the sarcasm wasn't going to bring those power levels up any faster. &ldquo;I'm trying to override this last conduit but I can't reach it. Not without bypassing the main line and rerouting back to it.&rdquo; A procedure that was undoubtedly against regulation. And for good reason. A bypass like that was notoriously unstable and that was </span><i>if</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> you even managed to do it in the first place. It wasn't just high voltage electricity in the conduits either, energy plasma powered these crafts. </span></p>  <p>&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;"">Well...do something about it. We still have ten minutes before the </span><i>Peregrine</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> gets here and won't they be disappointed to find a bunch of space debris floating around. I don't know about them but I'm sure as hell going to be disappointed to </span><i>be</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> that space debris.&rdquo; </span></p>  <p>&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;"">Then kindly stop talking so I can concentrate. There's no guarantee this won't just blow the ship into space debris first.&rdquo; Perhaps not so shockingly the stern of the shuttle became almost deathly silent. Good, he needed all his wits about him do this. Reaching his hand inside the wall he could feel the hairs on his arm stand up beneath the fabric of his uniform. One wrong move...</span></p>  <p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Desmond had turned his attention to the comm, anxious to get the hail that would signal the end to this little nightmare. So the transwarp drive had failed, big deal. He just wanted out of this with his skin intact. For a brief second he thought his vision was tricking him but soon realized where the strobes of intense light were coming from. Wheeling around in the pilot's chair the sight of the young engineer jerking with his arm still buried into the wall made his stomach drop. &ldquo;</span><i>Shit</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">!&rdquo; </span></p>  <p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">He was on his feet, still cursing, as he made the small distance between them in just a few leaps. At first he thought it was jut the crackling of energy around the jerking ensign but with cold realization he noticed the way the man's back was spasming out of control. Without much concern as to what happens when you touch a man engulfed with electric plasma, he reached for Narib and pulled as hard as he could. Both men, twitching with neural spasms, fell to the barely carpeted floor of the shuttle. Desmond was stunned by the shock, every muscle felt like it had been filled with needles, but Narib was on the floor beside him and now he was motionless. &ldquo;Ah hell, Vadi, I don't wanna have to kiss you.&rdquo; </span></p>  <p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Despite all of the medical wonders they were still trained in CPR, but if the ensign had severed his spine at the neck it wouldn't do him any good. The groaning of stressed metal was only getting worse and he could barely hear the ship's computer stating that an imminent hull breach was only seconds away. Vision began to distort at the tell-tale signs of an energizing beam, and he could almost picture the ship coming apart as their molecules were transformed into energy and then reassembled on the floor of the transporter pad aboard the </span><i>Peregrine</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">. They had a staff waiting and Desmond could see booted feet bustling around them before another shimmer of transporter beam engulfed them, whisking the pair off to the ship's infirmary before he lost track of what was going on and contented himself with the relaxing bliss of unconsciousness. </span></p></lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p>"

"event","<em>Please let me be dead</em>. Eyelids might as well have been steel gates as I lay in the murky waters unwilling to open them. The blast had knocked my body backward and mercilessly into the trench. No time to pity myself, with a force of will I opened my eyes to the black and acrid smoke and dust swirling above me in a haze of death itself. At least it wasn&rsquo;t the gas, my mask was down around my neck and I can&rsquo;t remember if that was from the force of falling of if I hadn&rsquo;t had it on to begin with. Irrelevant. The oddity of it all was the deafening silence that accompanied scenery which should be fraught with sound. <br /><br />My head is spinning but I manage to pull myself to my feet, the heavy wool of my uniform is now soaked through and feels at least fifty pounds heavier. I can&rsquo;t afford to be sluggish and despite the frigid air I peel back the layers and toss them to dry land above me. I don&rsquo;t even have time to assess any personal injuries I may have, there&rsquo;s a boy of fifteen huddled to the trench wall and he&rsquo;s bleeding fast. For now, for this moment, he is my only concern. I try yelling to him but I still can&rsquo;t even hear the sound of my own voice, the ringing refuses to stop. How close had that shell come? Before I can shrug off the thought I see another rocket tail. It&rsquo;s useless to yell, my hand shoots out until it finds fabric and I tug down as hard as I can, seeking refuge for us both in the placid and death infused waters. The blast sends a shockwave of expelled energy and both the boy and I are sloshed to the wall, my arm around him feels the weight of earth caving in. <br /><br />I refuse to be buried alive. Of all the deaths I can envision that is one I want to avoid at all costs. The trench&rsquo;s walls were made for shelter but they can no longer withstand weeks of rain and a barrage of missiles. By the time I&rsquo;ve clawed my way to the surface I&rsquo;m covered in mud and the boy in my arm is coughing. At least he's alive. Once I get us both to our feet I notice he isn't wearing a helmet. It must have been lost in the confusion. My ears are still ringing so I don't bother speaking, I reach up to my chin and unfasten the straps and sit the too big helmet on his head. With a thunk my knuckles rap on the top with a reassuring smile that I don't at all feel. <em>&quot;You'll live,&quot;</em> I want to say, but I'm not a great liar.&nbsp; I'm no longer sure I'll live, in fact, I'm already dead. <br /><br />I can't worry about myself, I'm already gone, that's how I have to see it. My life is already over, probably floating down the diseased waters of the trench, but these boys --they still have their lives and I can focus all my energy on them. If I make it out of this hell, maybe then I learn how to live again. <br /><br /><br />"

"event","Setting: Three weeks after the first deployment of the U.S.S. Enterprise under Captain Kirk's command. Alternate-Universe (Movie). <br /><br />Space really was the final frontier. It would be irresponsible of him to dwell on its vastness in conjunction with the recent demise of his home-world of Vulcan, but the thoughts were there. They hovered just beneath an icy determined control, like shadows beneath the surface of a frozen lake. In meditation the events leading up to and after it&rsquo;s destruction played over in precise clarity and time and time again he denied himself the abandon of emotion. One by one he locked them away. Fear, regret, sorrow, and anguish, but most of all his anger. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""continue..."">On the bridge he kept to his solemn and silent oath to never display the kind of emotions he had when James T. Kirk pushed him to the edge. A Vulcan&rsquo;s rage was a very dangerous force of nature and if it hadn&rsquo;t been for his father&rsquo;s calm and disciplined voice he might not have stopped until Kirk laid lifeless on the comm panel. He wasn&rsquo;t concerned about Jim&rsquo;s perception on the matter, it was the only course of action he felt available to him at the time and there was no logic in holding any grudges. If any of the crewman were to be worried about he knew the exact one.<br /><br />Stepping into the turbo lift following the young ensign he called for an all stop before turning to face Chekov. &ldquo;Might I have a moment of your time, Ensign?&rdquo;<br /><br />Not waiting long for a nod he continued on, seeing no reason to pause or even give a segue to the conversation at hand. &ldquo;I believe you have been avoiding eye contact with me for the past several weeks. Given that you are a somewhat reserved individual I have observed your behavior with the other bridge members and have found that I give you the most difficulty. If this is because of your involvement with the transporter incident that resulted in the death of Amanda Grayson, I should make it clear that I harbor no feelings of anger or resentment for you.&rdquo; In fact, he admired the young navigation officer&rsquo;s skills and intelligence in a way only a Vulcan could. <br /><br />&ldquo;You have shown admirable talents and knowledge in transporter theory and application. I do not hold you responsible for that event, on the contrary you successfully saved the lives of Captain Kirk and Lieutenant Sulu on a previous occasion. Am I correct in my conclusions?&rdquo; There was the possibility, however remote, that Chekov simply did not like him or felt intimidated by his presence, yet based on recent events it was most probable that the young ensign felt needless guilt for the death of his mother. In truth, talking to Chekov was therapeutic in his ongoing endeavor to keep his emotions in check. In a way he was relinquishing blame by freeing that burden from Chekov and from himself.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;</lj-cut><br />"

"event","Space Pirates! Original character for a new genre. Taylon Karde. Subject to some changes as we go along but this is the basic idea. <br /><br /><lj-cut>Name: Taylon Karde<br /><br />Height: 6'<br /><br />Weight: 185 lbs<br /><br />Hair: Platinum Blond (Natural).<br /><br />Eyes: Warm brown.<br /><br />Ethnicity: Humanoid.<br /><br />Birthdate: 556 P.C. (Post Cataclysm)<br /><br />Age: 32<br /><br />Gender: Male<br /><br />Appearance: <br /><br />An old and torn up black leather jacket is his insignia of choice and he wears it constantly. It's a quiet joke among his crew that he sleeps in it though none of them dare to find out if that's true. Any clean shirt and trousers will do, though he prefers warm tones over cooler ones. <br /><br />Citizenship: Regalus IV, third class citizen. <br /><br />Place of Birth: Yves, Dryston Prime, Argentum, Regalus IV. <br /><br />Marital Status: Perpetual bachelor. <br /><br />Occupation: Cargo Shipping (of technically illegal products). Intelligence Sales. <br /><br />Affiliation: Freelance Guildsmen <br /><br />Education/Degree: Apprenticeship in Interplanetary Transportation&nbsp; <br /><br />Psychological Profile<br /><br />Character Concept: Pirate<br /><br />Orientation: Straight<br /><br />Demeanor: Cavalier <br /><br />Nature: Pragmatist <br /><br />Personality:<br /><br />Taylon, despite his many flaws, is a perfectly honest man &ndash; that is, of course, if you buy into his loose definition of honesty. Every lie has a grain of truth in it and he believes that grain is sufficient. He is a fiercely pragmatic man yet in contrast he is also religious, though not devout. Superstitious almost in the extreme he takes the worship of Va'al very seriously as she has been known to cause chaos in the lives of those who displease her. Kedra is another of his goddesses, the perks of which involve very talented priestesses &ndash; he is a firm believer that every man should worship at Kedra's throne and bedchamber. <br /><br />Goals: Power his ship and pay his crew. Also not getting caught by the ITB (Interplanetary Transportation Bureau) would also be a bonus.&nbsp; <br /><br />Classification: Captain of a refitted U-Series Freighter. <br /><br />Power Rank: (1-10, 1 being the lowest and equivalent of a complete novice and 10 being expert level)<br /><br />Physical &ndash; 6, works out regularly.<br />Dexterity &ndash; 5, tinkers with odd parts from time to time.<br />Stamina &ndash; 7, puts in more time doing cardio than lifting weights. <br />Durability &ndash; 4, without armor he can hold his own in a fist fight, but he's still vulnerable to weaponry. <br /><br />Skill Level:<br /><br />Mechanical &ndash; 8, tinkers with odd parts, knows how to repair his own ship. <br />Weaponry &ndash; 8, well versed in both personal weapons and vessel mounted ones. Taylon is a fair shot which varies depending on the type of weapon being used. Particularly fond of his automatic particle accelerator. <br />Medical &ndash; 2, he can put on a bandage and splint a fracture but don't ask him to set a broken bone or sterilize an infection. <br />Leadership &ndash; 7, his crewmen wouldn't follow him to hell and back, but they certainly don't undermine his authority either. He keeps a tight ship without being too hard on morale. <br />Intellectual &ndash; 6, can read and write and do his arithmetics but he's no scholar and has no desire to be either. He knows what he needs to in order to get the job done and can be a cunning individual, he just doesn't have &ldquo;book smarts&rdquo;. <br /><br />Tech Level:<br /><br />Engineering &ndash; 9, he knows his ship inside and out and in-fact has built most of her parts by now along with the numerous &ldquo;modifications&rdquo; that are certainly not up to code. He frustrates his engineer daily. <br />&nbsp;Medical&nbsp; &ndash; 2, he can use the bandages and the disinfectants well enough but don't hand him a scalpel and ask him to use it properly. Medical technology is best left to those who studied medicine. <br />&nbsp;Weaponry&nbsp; &ndash; 8, he knows how to clean, fire, repair, and sometimes even build his own weapons. Modifying them with his own improvements is a hobby of his. <br /><br />Resources: The Freelance Guildsmen supply him with trading opportunities that he wouldn't be able to find on the legal market. They also offer protection under the guise of a legitimate guild, fabricating any legal documents necessary for their members. Their reach is long and powerful and their leaders have a substantial lack of humor. <br /><br />Special Abilities<br /><br />Advantages: Quick witted and gifted with a silver tongue; if Taylon can't talk or bribe his way out of a situation he can think his way out instead. <br /><br /><br />Powers: Other than his wit he does not have any supernatural powers. <br /><br /><br />Skills: Thinks fast on his feet, very well versed in interplanetary politics and plays them to his advantage, good communication skills, and has a knack for reading people. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Martial Arts: Basic hand to hand combat. <br /><br />Languages: Common and Principo. <br /><br />Disadvantages: Risk taker, too ambitious for his own good, gets in over his head often, not always reliable. <br /><br />Transportation: U-Series Freighter &ndash; Havoc. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Contacts: Freelance Guildsmen<br /><br />Enemies: Any other guild who attempts to do unregulated business in the Freelancer's territories. Often the ITB. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Relatives: Deceased and rarely thought or spoken of. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />History: <br /><br />Taylon Karde was born on Regalus IV on the main continent of Argentum to a third class citizen father and mother. His father owned and operated his own shipping contract with the ITB and apprenticed his son in the trade. Never quite satisfied with a mundane job working under his father, Taylon began to expand his horizons by joining the Freelance Guildsmen. That act alone was enough to estrange him from his family on Regalus IV and he remained that way until his parent's death during the country's war with their neighbors. He now works for Cratus, a senior member in the guild with powerful ties, and is being groomed for his position in the near future.&nbsp; </lj-cut><br /><br /><br />"

"event","Detaching was never my issue, in fact I excel at it. Even with the strained syllables in Gabriel's voice I don't let them affect me. I can't. The moment I do is the moment I start to get weaker and weaker until someone, or both of us, ends up dead. Someone has to keep a level head around here and I silently volunteer. &quot;Because it's what I do, Gabe.&quot; That should be a simple enough response to his question of why I hunt, but I can hear the light sigh even if Gabriel tried to hide it. &quot;It would be wonderful to believe everything that's out there has a choice to be good or evil and that, like you, it chooses to be good, but it doesn't work that way. If you think it's just werewolves and vampires, I envy your innocence.&quot; Envied it and wanted to protect it, but how could I argue my point without letting Gabriel know the depths that other world went to. &quot;At least I make the distinction now, between those who can choose and those that can't or won't.&quot; I wasn't the Order now, I had my own set of rules and my own freedom to hunt what I wanted to. Gabriel had to understand at least that much. It never was about the killing for me, I was always detached from it.<br /><br />I could hear through the silence those words left unspoken and if I tried I knew I could enter Gabriel&rsquo;s mind and pick it apart for what I needed to know. It was tempting, I am not going to lie. Will power was never a shortcoming for me and I held back the reigns of my mental powers with a practiced ease. If it became vital to get my point across perhaps I would delve into that artistic mind to better understand how to talk to him, but until then I could not and would not invade his privacy.&nbsp; <br /><br />&ldquo;My innocence?&rdquo; Gabriel&rsquo;s voice was almost foreign to my ears, perhaps I had struck a nerve. &ldquo;How ironic.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;A poor choice of words,&rdquo; I conceded without losing any argumentative ground. &ldquo;You have a good deal of understanding about your own &lsquo;condition&rsquo;,&rdquo; I chose my words carefully, this was treacherous and very uncharted ground my feet were treading over. Highly unpredictable. &ldquo;However, I doubt you know what else is really out there, and I&rsquo;m not talking about the Fey Children and their courts; they are truly children in comparison.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Comparison to what? I know there&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re not telling me Vincent, I&rsquo;ve known for weeks now&nbsp; and I&rsquo;ve given you the time and the opportunity to share it with me. Now I&rsquo;m insisting.&rdquo;<br /><br />That was a slight shock. Gabriel excelled at patience, this much I knew, but I had not picked up on his willingness to keep curiosity at bay. I wouldn&rsquo;t have. I would have backed him into a metaphorical, and possibly physical, wall and forced the information out of him if he ever kept something of importance from me. In my defense it was for Gabriel&rsquo;s own protection that I kept him in the so called &lsquo;dark&rsquo;. <br /><br />&ldquo;You were a religious man once and possibly still are,&rdquo; I started to ease him into it drawing on personal experience to help explain the very real threat everyone faced yet had no clue about. &ldquo;Then maybe it won&rsquo;t be so difficult for you to believe that hell is very real.&rdquo;<br /><br />I let my arms fold across my chest, a position I liked to take when I felt vulnerable. Why I felt vulnerable in front of Gabriel I couldn&rsquo;t tell. Perhaps because I was opening up a new world for him and it wasn&rsquo;t one I ever wanted to be a part of let alone share. &ldquo;In the past few months there have been over eighty possessions in this city alone. Some of them are repeats so that does not represent the actual number of demonic presence here but I wouldn&rsquo;t celebrate just yet. Only a year ago one or two possessions were the most The Order would ever see&hellip;globally.&rdquo;<br /><br />The silence was deafening and I would give anything for it to break. It was understandable that Gabriel needed time to process that kind of information but the anticipation and anxiety were starting to get to me. Idly I wondered just how antsy I looked with my fingers now sweeping over my shirt checking for missing buttons or wrinkles to smooth out. <br /><br />&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; Oddly enough Gabriel didn&rsquo;t sound nervous or upset. Why should that surprise me? There was a certain calmness about Gabe that drew me a pace closer. Maybe it would rub off. I wasn&rsquo;t panicked, at least not yet, and I rarely ever let it show when I was anxious but at the moment I was fairly sure Gabriel could see it. If I didn&rsquo;t know what anxiety looked like how was I supposed to know what exactly I should be hiding? <br /><br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I answered honestly. Perhaps the uncertainty was what bothered me the most. I never did well with the unknown. &ldquo;The Order seems to think we&rsquo;re facing Armageddon, aharit ha-yamim, <br />Ragnarok, Qiyamah, or whatever it is you want to call it. I&rsquo;m not so dramatic but I do believe we&rsquo;re about to go to war and that souls do lie in the balance. Now, ask me again why I&rsquo;m still hunting.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;But what can you, one man, do about it?&rdquo; There were times I appreciated Gabriel&rsquo;s blunt honesty, this was not one of those times. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to insult you, Vincent,&rdquo; did I look insulted, I thought to myself with a frown tugging at my lips, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re just one man. Putting yourself at risk needlessly won&rsquo;t stop this potential war and if it&rsquo;s as bad as you think it is then what do you hope to accomplish?&rdquo; <br /><br />I didn&rsquo;t like being brought into question like that, especially not by Gabe who clearly had no right to judge my abilities. What I hated most, though, was the fact that he was right and that I wanted to have no part in admitting it. &ldquo;What does it matter? I&rsquo;ll be damned before I sit on my ass and do <em>nothing</em>. Maybe burying your head in the sand worked for you all these years but that&rsquo;s not my style.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I do hope,&rdquo; Gabriel started in a tone that bordered on agitation but was tempered with strained patience, &ldquo;that you are not calling me a coward.&rdquo; <br /><br />Had I said that? Maybe I hinted at it. Either way I hadn&rsquo;t meant it like that. It irritated me that Gabriel would throw it back in my face in that unnervingly calm manner of his. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to call you a coward when you act like one.&rdquo; I was angry and really he was asking for it with that borderline passive aggressive attitude of his. I wished he&rsquo;d just yell at me so we could get this over with already. <br /><br />&ldquo;The only thing I&rsquo;m afraid of,&rdquo; Gabriel went on as if he wasn&rsquo;t bothered by my aggression which only fanned the flames of my anger, &ldquo;is you getting yourself killed for this. The Order isn&rsquo;t going to &ldquo;bury it&rsquo;s head in the sand&rdquo;, to borrow a line from you, and sooner or later they&rsquo;re going to take notice.&rdquo; <br /><br />I laughed. It was a derisive sound that passed my lips before I had time to think better of it. &ldquo;You think The Order is the biggest of my problems? Gabriel I haven&rsquo;t been hunting vampires or wolves or even misguided Fey Children, I&rsquo;ve been tracking demons. If you think the Order is going to come after me for doing their job for them then you don&rsquo;t understand the magnitude of the situation here. They don&rsquo;t even have the resources to go after our kind any more. They barely have the resources to fend off this new wave of demonic presence. Hell, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they offered me a job at this point.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You say that as if it&rsquo;s supposed to ease my mind. It doesn&rsquo;t. But,&rdquo; I could hear the sigh in Gabriel&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll do what you want. I can only hope that you&rsquo;ll be safe.&rdquo; <br /><br />I was infuriated and frankly I&rsquo;m not even sure I had any right to be. Why couldn&rsquo;t Gabriel just have it out with me so this could all be over with? Did he always have to be this difficult when he was right? I should have said I was sorry, I should have said I understood, I should have said anything but what came out of my mouth. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re damn right I will.&rdquo; <br /><br />My independence is everything. When I fight, I fight alone. The price for this alienation tonight would be a very big and empty bed. As I slammed my bedroom door shut I had to wonder if it was at all worth it. Maybe the price of independence was higher than I could afford. <br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","Ran always has this way of inspiring a Vincent muse. It's been far too long but that's what vacationing will do to you.&nbsp;I look forward to routine again in a week or so. At any rate I decided to do something I'm not entirely good at and so this is written in *GASP*&nbsp;first person. I&nbsp;wanted some practice with a style I don't tend to enjoy. I&nbsp;actually love how this turned out, shockingly.<br /><br /><lj-cut>&quot;Is this thing even on?&quot; I ask, picking at the plastic and oblong shaped buttons of the little recording device Gabriel had suggested that I&nbsp;use to record my thoughts in lieu of a written journal. The object is cold but then again so are my hands. I&nbsp;breathe a sigh, feeling utterly ridiculous talking into this foreign object that will by some technological magic keep my voice inside to play back at any later date of my choosing. But not just *my* choosing, anyone could hear these private thoughts. Taking another breath I press onward, diligent and determined as always in a task set out before me.<br /><br />&quot;Right.&quot;<br /><br />How very succinct. Kicking myself for my lack of anything intelligent to say I&nbsp;sat back and tried for something else.<br /><br />&quot;I&nbsp;suppose I'll start with a date. It's Tuesday, May twenty-sixth, two-thousand-and-nine, and I&nbsp;feel ridiculous. Gabriel suggested that I let myself ramble, maybe he's better at constant streams of thought than I&nbsp;am. I've never asked, but he can go on about coffee and clay for hours if I&nbsp;let him. What am I&nbsp;saying? These aren't exactly the deep thoughts I&nbsp;had hoped for.&quot;<br /><br />Sitting in one position was starting to make me antsy, I&nbsp;had to move. Maybe the recorder picked up on the shuffle of silk on the fabric of the couch, maybe that passage went unnoticed. What certainly didn't go unnoticed was the scuff of a shin on a coffee table that must have been moved closer for the morning brew of a certain potter. <br /><br />&quot;God damn it!&quot; I&nbsp;yelped into the device before thinking better of it. &quot;Real smooth,&quot; I&nbsp;drawled out and much like myself the recorder couldn't pick up on my twitching lips. At least I&nbsp;could feel the halfway amused twisting that came easily to them at my lack of grace. <br /><br />&quot;This is the part where I&nbsp;say something with depth about my state of mind, where I&nbsp;record my current and pressing thoughts and relieve the burden of carrying them around in my mind. I&nbsp;really hate coffee. Gabriel doesn't know that, it would break his little wolfy heart, I'm sure. Why do I&nbsp;drink it? Because he enjoys it so much?&nbsp;I've never been one to indulge in the fancies of others, why start now?&quot;<br /><br />A pause before a self effacing laugh.<br /><br />&quot;Am I&nbsp;really going to stand here and talk about coffee? Gabriel, what have you done to me? What did I&nbsp;ever do to deserve this agonizingly embarrassing task?&quot;<br /><br />I heaved another sigh, though this one was tinged with a bit of humor. Idly I wondered if the recorder could convey the mingled emotions of a sigh with any efficiency when replayed later. Somehow I doubted it. <br /><br />Maybe it could pick up my feet shuffling on the wooden floor of the living room as I&nbsp;paced the length of it by the half wall separating it from the kitchen. Another long silence.<br /><br />&quot;I'm angry,&quot; I&nbsp;realized. &quot;Not at Gabriel, not even at Ilya...maybe not even at Marcus. I'm angry and I&nbsp;don't even know why.&quot; Now there was something for me to discuss but I'm not entirely sure I&nbsp;want to go down this road. &quot;I'm angry at myself,&quot;&nbsp;I finally blurted out in realization. From there it was as if a tidal wave broke the levies of my mind and my feet moved faster in their calculated pace across the room.<br /><br />&quot;Nothing has changed and I&nbsp;wanted it to. I&nbsp;wanted the line between good and evil to have more distinction and I&nbsp;always knew that if I&nbsp;crossed it I'd be able to find that distinction. Well here I&nbsp;am, I've crossed it and all I found was that I&nbsp;was a monster all along -- just in another context.&quot;&nbsp;Here I&nbsp;gave a derisive snort. &quot;Maybe there's no such thing as 'good', we're all just levels of evil.&quot;<br /><br />I&nbsp;paused to think that over and a thought stuck out as just not being right. &quot;No, maybe we're not that hopeless. Gabriel could be proof otherwise. I've never met anyone so bound and determined to do the right thing, even if he doesn't know it. I&nbsp;almost think of him as being innocent because of it, and then he'll go and surprise me with a witty comment and I&nbsp;can only hope that I wasn't drinking something at the time. It always shocks me even when I should have known it was coming. Even after the months we've spent living together I still can't quite figure him out and there are times I&nbsp;don't ever want to.&nbsp;I&nbsp;like the puzzle and the surprises.&quot;<br /><br />How could I&nbsp;go on with my anger after the mentioning of Gabriel? Already I&nbsp;can smell clay and coffee mingling with just the mental utterence of his name. &quot;I&nbsp;don't know what I'd do without him,&quot; again the words came to my lips as a shock. Perhaps this excersize wasn't as futile as I&nbsp;had first thought. &quot;The day is coming, the one in which I&nbsp;fear I&nbsp;may have to find out. I don't have to be able to see to know what the lead up to war looks like. The part I don't know yet is what the sides will be made from. This has gone further than simple vampire versus werewolf versus The&nbsp;Order. Much further. I&nbsp;don't know where it's all leading, only that I&nbsp;feel like I'm in a current which leads to a thundering waterfall -- I&nbsp;just wish I&nbsp;knew how far away it is and how long the drop. It'd also be nice to know what kind of rocks are at the bottom.&quot;&nbsp;Too figurative? I&nbsp;deal in those sensations daily, it doesn't seem too far of a leap to speak in them too. <br /><br />I sighed again, this time there wasn't any humor to be found mixed in. &quot;Ah Gabe, what have I&nbsp;gotten you into?&quot;<br /><br />And then, just like unannounced commencement of the wind, came the sent I&nbsp;was so familiarized with. Caffinated Earth. Gabriel was home. My thumb quickly slid over and pressed down on the stop button, or at least I&nbsp;think that's where Gabriel had showed me where it was. &quot;You're home earlier than I&nbsp;expected,&quot; I said, hopefully with a level and even voice. I didn't want him to know I&nbsp;had been just pouring out my thoughts into the little device. Why? I'm not entirely sure.<br /><br />&quot;Looks like rain out, I&nbsp;thought I'd get a head start home and miss getting showered on. Was I&nbsp;interrupting something?&quot; Now why did his voice sound hopeful? I&nbsp;resisted the urge to smirk.<br /><br />&quot;No,&quot; my tone was final.<br /><br />&quot;Oh good, then we have time for a pot of coffee.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Don't we always?&quot; I asked, slipping the recorder into a pocket while my other hand searched out the bar stools to take a seat. I may not like the brew but I&nbsp;can hear Gabriel humming a little tune to himself while he moved about the tiny space with the clink of mugs and the rhythmic <em>drip drip drip</em> of the pot and for this space of time it doesn't really matter that I&nbsp;don't enjoy the taste. I&nbsp;enjoy Gabe. <br /><br />&quot;Don't you dare put any sugar in mine,&quot;&nbsp;I bantered as usual with a slight upward turn taking to my lips.<br /><br />&quot;I'd never dream of it.&quot;</lj-cut><br />"

For a handful of heartbeats he waited for the captain to make up his mind, a struggle that seemed to be consuming his commanding officer ever since they entered the Wolf system and the battle raging there. Fingers raced over the control panel in an effort to at least stem the flow of the twin fuel sources that were gushing into the core and hurling the Galaxy class starship into very treacherous waters. </span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&ldquo;<i><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Eject the core, Lieutenant,</span></i><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">&rdquo; he could hear the com system switch over to full broadcast, &ldquo;</span></span><i><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">this is the captain speaking, all hands brace for impact and prepare to evacuate.</span></i><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">&rdquo; Again the com switched, this time back over to the lieutenant's channel. &ldquo;</span></span><i><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Prepare to divert all power to the shields, Lieutenant, I doubt we'll escape the blast radi--</span></i><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">&rdquo;</span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Captain, I can't activate the ejection sequence,&rdquo; Narib interrupted with the discouraging news, &ldquo;the system is too badly damaged.&rdquo; For a long moment the engineer stared at the angrily flashing warning on the display panel in front of him, listening to the rhythmic blaring of alarms and the calm warning that their ship was about to blow itself to pieces. His mind, however, was far from idle. Every mechanical spec of the ship were running through his mind as fast as he could recall them, searching for some way to stall the inevitable if only for long enough to get most of the crew to the escape pods. His captain was already ahead of him in that regard.</span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&ldquo;<i><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">--and meet at the rendezvous point.

It was a short jog over to the blast door control panel, his voice carried as far as he could project it ordering all of his engineering staff out and to their escape pods located in the adjacent corridor.

What's the plan?&rdquo;</span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Narib's brows furrowed above an equally crinkled nose but the crewman was right he couldn't do this alone. &ldquo;We'll siphon off the containment field from the storage pods, it won't last but it'll at least buy us enough time to get those pods out of range.&rdquo; His crewman nodded.</span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The pair of them entered the sweltering warp core chamber and he could immediately feel the effects of intense theta radiation. His crewman cocked his head to the side as they split out around the core. &ldquo;You do know this is entirely against Starfleet regulations, right?&rdquo;</span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The lieutenant had to give a lopsided smile at that before his fingers raced over the control panel. &ldquo;I'll let them lecture me on it later. Be prepared to drain your pod's containment field on my mark, this has to be done simultaneously for it to work.&rdquo;</span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;""><b>Warning, warp core breach imminent. Theta radiation levels approaching fatal limits.</b></span><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">&rdquo;</span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A shaking hand reached up to brush aside sweat from his brow in mild irritation as radiation sickness started to set in. &ldquo;Computer,&rdquo; Narib barked, &ldquo;shut that damn thing off!&rdquo; He didn't need to be reminded of the danger they were in, it was painfully obvious enough. &ldquo;Yvers, isn't it?&rdquo; </span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Yes sir. Brandon sir.&rdquo; The pair of them exchanged glances before cutting their eyes away to their respective control panels. No time to get better acquainted.</span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Decrease containment at five percent increments starting at my mark and every two seconds after that until you reach twenty five percent capacity. That should hold both the core and the pods for ten minutes at the most.&rdquo; He was being overly optimistic but at a time like this they could use some optimism. &ldquo;Mark.&rdquo; </span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Dialing back the antimatter containment fields around their storage pods was against regulations for a reason and it was a damn good one too. If the antimatter contained inside touched the canister itself the blast from the energy released during complete annihilation of both particles would be catastrophic. The storage pods themselves were designed with separate containment fields and generators for those fields as a precaution if the ship were to be destroyed the antimatter would be safely contained. To tamper with the fields was no small offense on a starship, however when that ship was facing a warp core breach suddenly the regulations didn't seem so absolute. </span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A fluctuation in the twin pod's magnetic containment field caught his attention and when he looked over he saw Crewman Yvers gripping the panel in front of him as if it were the only thing keeping him standing. &ldquo;Yvers! Don't fall behind, this has to be simultaneous or we'll blow the ship right now.&rdquo; He could understand how the man felt, however, with his own vision starting to swirl the control's colors together into shimmering patterns. Hallucinations were just the start of radiation sickness, but at the rate they were being exposed it was the least of their worries. </span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Y-yes sir! Sorry sir, I don't know what came over me.&rdquo; Yvers blinked the fuzzy vision out of his own eyes and keyed in the right sequence to match his containment field's strength with Lieutenant Narib's. &ldquo;You know, sir, it's been an honor. You weren't anything like I was expecting.&rdquo;</span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><i><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Good, keep him talking</span></i><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">. &ldquo;Oh? And what was that?&rdquo;</span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I dunno, more of a tight ass like the professors at the academy.&rdquo; Immediately Yvers stiffened and looked like he'd been caught out of uniform on the job. &ldquo;I'm sorry sir, that was inappropriate.&rdquo;</span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Vadi smiled as he punched in the next round of instructions to the panel. &ldquo;Brandon, we're soaked in sweat and theta radiation, as long as you keep decreasing that field I don't give a damn what kind of language you use. Hell, I'm about to get pretty colorful myself.&rdquo;</span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Brandon chuckled and punched in the orders to decrease field strength on cue. &ldquo;I thought the Bajoran prophets frowned on that sort of thing, if you don't mind my curiosity.&rdquo; </span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">They probably do, but they aren't here and they'll have to get in line with Starfleet and take it up with me later.&rdquo; </span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Yeah, if we make it out of here,&rdquo; Brandon muttered, looking as if he was about to lose his footing again. </span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&ldquo;<span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We will. This is going to work, we've already boosted the internal warp core field by ten percent.&rdquo; It wasn't much and it certainly wasn't enough to save the ship but it was more than enough to keep it from breaching just yet. &ldquo;We're almost at twenty five percent storage pod capacity, be prepared to get the hell out of here once we reach it.&rdquo; </span></span><i><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I have no idea how long it'll hold</span></i><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">, Narib thought to himself, there was no need to verbalize what they both were thinking. </span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&ldquo;<i><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Engineering?</span></i><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">&rdquo;</span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The voice was disembodied and startling enough that the lieutenant forgot to hit his combadge to respond at first. &ldquo;Captain?&rdquo;</span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&ldquo;<i><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The hell are you doing on this ship still?

It was an old Earth custom he had read about in one of his various data books on old Earth sailing technology. Captains tended to go down with their ships and just because the venue had changed didn't mean the mindset followed course. </span></span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&ldquo;<i><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Good job, but get the hell out of there.

</style>   <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p><lj-cut><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Interrogations generally consisted of a few well placed threats to get the creature's attention, deliberate application of pain, and the worthless tongues would loosen in an instant. Generally this was the case and every fresh member could pry what information he needed from the mouths of the damned before ending their miserable 'lives'. When the usual methods proved inadequate for a particularly stubborn creature there were those who were called in to handle the situation. There were those who were trained in various methods of retrieving valuable information from those unwilling to produce it without force.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Lycans tended to be the easiest to exploit, Vincent had found. When he had gotten the call he had begun mentally preparing himself for how he would deal with their current uncooperative captive. It was the mark of a good interrogator to keep all of his cards close to his chest and Vincent's poker face was outstanding. His statuesque features remained chiseled as he entered the small room with the chained beast sitting bound to a metallic chair fused into the ground. No doubt he would appear human but Vincent wasn't burdened with facetious appearances.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&ldquo;The location,&rdquo; Vincent snapped in a tone that would leave a listener sure of his impatience. His 'routine' was always straightforward, akin to almost everything else he did in life and work.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&ldquo;I've already said my peace,&rdquo; came the surprisingly calm reply, &ldquo;you can go ahead and kill me, I won't betray my pack.&rdquo;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&ldquo;It was never a question of our ability to exterminate you,&rdquo; Vincent's coolly modulated voice came back, &ldquo;only a question of <i>when</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">.&rdquo; </span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;Your associates have already done their worst and haven't been able to get very far, which is presumably why you are standing here. Time will do nothing but be wasted.&rdquo; </span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;There is something you will come to understand,&rdquo; Vincent began with a slight curl taking to his lips, &ldquo;I am not my associates and I was called in because I know how to make creatures like you talk. </span><i>Bring her in</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">.&rdquo; The last was spoken toward the door which opened upon his command producing a small child. Judging by the rattled gasp in front of him, Vincent assumed the point had been made. &ldquo;I find that with you Lycans a family member can loosen the tongue, how fortunate for me that you have quite a few.&rdquo;</span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;</span><i>Daddy!</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">&rdquo; her voice squeaked at his side when a hand reached out to grab her by the throat to hold her out standing in front of him. </span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;Marisa! You can't possibly be capable of killing a </span><i>child</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">. She's a harmless natural bred, she doesn't even lose control under the full moon!&rdquo; His voice was no longer that infuriating calm.</span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;You have absolutely no idea what I am capable of but you are soon to find out if you do not answer my very simple question. I am emphatically uninterested in your lies.&rdquo; To demonstrate just how uninterested he was a hand produced from his side a very slender and very silver jagged blade. The child beast shrieked.</span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;No! Leave her out of this, she's only a child!&rdquo; The sounds of chains rattling indicated to Vincent the struggle the beast was putting forth to try and get at his young. </span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	And there it was, that strange twisting in his gut he always felt during operations like this. The feeling was a useless gesture and only served to call into question absolute truths that were unassailable by mere soldiers in this holy war. Pity was a luxury he was not allowed to pursue and it was a weakness he was wholly ashamed of. Nothing of any emotional value registered on his marble visage, and just like the stone he was impervious to the tears around him. </span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	</span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;There is no question as to both of your deaths, the only thing you are in control of in this matter is how fast she dies. I will not ask you again for the location, the next time this blade touches her skin her screams will not stop until I have exactly what I want from you.&rdquo; When the silence extended, broken only by their mutual sobs, his knife hand got to work on the child beast's flesh. </span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	Five minutes was a veritable eternity with the small child screaming over and over again from the pure agony he was inflicting on her. Her father's responses were only screamed pleas for him to stop, nothing even close to the adequate response to stay his hand. What a stubborn beast. To let your own flesh and blood writhe in pain to keep a secret was so very inhuman, it only served to bolster his confidence that what he was doing couldn't be wrong if they were simply creatures to be dealt with. </span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	Finally the girl's body began to grow limp in his hands and he knew her usefulness was just about worn out. She had partially changed from the pain and confusion but it was still only a simple matter to reach up to both sides of her head and twist hard until he felt the snap. She was by no means dead, simply immobilized for the moment, but the sharp blade that pierced her heart next quickly ended her life. It was a small mercy at that point.</span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;</span><i>You're a monster</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">,&rdquo; the creature's voice was hoarse from his screams. &ldquo;You dare call us the beasts but you had no problem killing an innocent child.&rdquo;</span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;She was never innocent,&rdquo; Vincent shot back in a cool clip of his voice, &ldquo;and neither are you. A few simple words could have ended her suffering far sooner.&rdquo;</span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	An unexpected sound had Vincent tilting his head slightly. A coarse laugh. &ldquo;You've used up your leverage, Hunter. All you can do is kill me now.&rdquo;</span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	It was Vincent's turn to laugh. &ldquo;Why do you assume that she was the only other one we caught? I plan on destroying every member of your family before you until you give me exactly what I've asked for. We have ways to gently put your kind down, your children could die quietly in their sleep or they could die just like your Marisa--&rdquo;</span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	</span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;Don't you dare say her name,&rdquo; the command wasn't yelled but instead growled. </span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;You are not in any kind of position to give me orders, </span><i>Lycan</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">. </span><i>Send the wife in next</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">.&rdquo; </span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	There was the sound of a door opening and then a startled gasp filled with horrified grief. The body of the little beast child still laid at his feet. &ldquo;Maybe she will talk if you won't.&rdquo; </span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;David what...what has he done? What has he done to Marisa?&rdquo; her voice was bordering on panic. Perhaps she would be more useful to him than the husband.</span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;Lily, don't.&rdquo; </span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;Your mate has been very uncooperative, the result of which ended in your spawn's rather obnoxiously loud death. It's fortunate that your kind reproduce in droves, I can continue with their extermination until you tell me where your pack leader is.&rdquo; </span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	Perhaps he should not have been so callous with the female, her only response was a heaving sob for the most part. Odd how they could mimic human emotions so well yet not be worthy of the status of the ones they imitated. &ldquo;Do I need to do another demonstration with your second youngest?&rdquo;</span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;We would all rather die than betray our own,&rdquo; the female beast spoke up with an infuriating amount of defiance in her voice that didn't belong there. </span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	Vincent had many weakness and she had just exploited one of them. Anger was not an emotion he should be having during an operation like this, it only served to get rid of subjects and leverage faster than information could flow. Being defied by a beast was more than he was willing to stomach and his hand impacted her face with ease despite his blindness. </span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	</span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;You are going to regret using that tongue for something other than giving me the information I want. And you,&rdquo; he was directing his voice back at the male, &ldquo;you will be begging for me to listen to you tell me all that I want to know by the time I'm done.&rdquo; </span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	With her hands tied and bound behind her back the female was not a threat to him. Turning on them both he strode purposefully to the back of the small interrogations room to bench covered in utensils. The heat coming from one of them guided his hands over. The large crucible was easily held between tongs and the contents remained unspilt as he made his way back over, grabbing the female creature by her hair to lift her sagging body up off the ground. &ldquo;You have exactly one last chance to speak,&rdquo; Vincent hissed out, lifting the crucible up as a warning.</span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;</span><i>Go to hell</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">.&rdquo;</span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	He wouldn't even dignify that with a verbal response. The hand that had been in her hair swiftly struck out to her jaw, clamping down with enough force to pry her mouth wide open. Without blinking, without even a flicker of emotion in his sightless eyes, he tilted the crucible to pour the molten silver down into her mouth to clog and burn clear down her throat. Her body bucked and the smell that came from her sick gasps was acrid but Vincent still did not flinch. When he finally released her he could hear her thrashing on the ground even over the agonized cry of rage and grief coming from her mate just a foot away. </span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p align=""center"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">***</span></p> <p align=""left"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	Vincent woke up in a cold sweat, the ghosts of screams still echoing in his memory. Rolling out of bed he did his best to not wake Gabe across the hall as he stumbled his way into the shared bathroom to empty the contents of the previous night's meal from his gut. Turning on the hot water he cupped the  running liquid from the sink in his hands and splashed it a few times over his face. He was acutely aware of his hands as he placed them under the scalding hot water. Not even the distraction of the water could keep the rebounding question out of his mind. </span><i>What have I done</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">? </span></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> </lj-cut><br />"

"event","So Jack found this list of 100 words to be used as prompts when you're running low on creativity. We thought it'd be a fun idea to try and write little ficlets and draw some quick pictures. Me with the writing, he with the drawing, as it were. So, I shall try and have up by tonight a ficlet for prompt number 1 and I'll take it from there. If anyone else wants in just say so and I'll be sure to read/view whatever you got going. 

As a fun aside, Jack'll be drawing something to go along with what I've wrote so this should be interesting."

Despite the pleasant meal at a local cafe it was far from a date &ndash; Vincent made sure that detail was perfectly clear. It was one thing to be living with a wolf and quite another to let himself get romantically involved with a vampire. At this juncture in his life he didn't think it was a great idea to let himself get romantically involved with anyone. Ilya was good company, they talked primarily on Russian literature before moving over to politics for a short stint before realizing their views were a bit too skewed to continue having a polite conversation. The wine was tastefully selected, Vincent had to admit, and the entire evening went smoother than he would have imagined. It left him with something to think about but that didn't mean he would be inviting the man home.</p>  <lj-cut><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">It had gotten rather late by the time Vincent realized just how long they'd been talking, to find someone who held him in good conversation for so long was a rare thing indeed &ndash; though Gabriel rivaled him at least in his random creativity. Who knew the concept of molding coffee mugs could be so enthralling? Needless to say Vincent didn't bring up his living arrangements with the Petrov praotet, Russia was a long ways from New York but he was convinced the same prejudices between one kind to the other still existed. How modern of him, he thought sardonically. Ilya would be getting his own transportation back to his posh hotel and surprisingly he didn't need much convincing that Vincent would be fine on his own to return to his small apartment.</p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The walk home was uneventful and he followed the familiar noises and smells from the local Chinese take out to the constant jazz coming from a music store along the way. It was going to rain soon, he could smell it on the air over the other odors wafting about the city at night. As he walked the sounds grew quieter and quieter. His neighborhood was all but deserted now. One building had burned down during a fire some years ago and the owners hadn't had enough insurance to cover the expenses of rebuilding and so it remain unoccupied and an 'eye-sore' as his Realtor had put it before hastily correcting herself. Frankly Vincent enjoyed the quiet atmosphere and the fact that he could come and go without drawing too much attention to himself from nosy neighbors with too much free time and not enough bridge games to go to.</p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">It wasn't until he got to the steps that he knew something was wrong. Gabriel was by no means a quiet roommate but his noises never bothered Vincent and in fact he was so used to them that not hearing at least some form of music or humming coming from the still broken kitchen window that faced the street put the hunter on edge. He didn't need to see the moon to know her cycles and he knew without a doubt that Gabriel was not due for a change for another week at least. And then he heard it, the single most defining piece of evidence that something was indeed very wrong. He couldn't make out the words but he could certainly hear another voice along with Gabriel's and by the pitch and rhythm he knew it was an argument.</p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">His feet took the stairs two at a time and the broken doorknob to the apartment's front door only sped him on further. He didn't bother to get out his key, a part of him knew the door would be either unlocked or broken in. It was of little comfort to find it already ajar, especially when he could make out the voices now and knew whose the stranger's belonged to.</p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&ldquo;Protecting him won't save your hide, <i>lycan</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">.&rdquo; There was a sound like a pistol's chamber being loaded. A sliding click. &ldquo;These aren't your run of the mill bullets, but I'm guessing you're smart enough to have figured that out by now. I'm not asking again.&rdquo;</span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;If you know what I am then I assume you came prepared,&rdquo; it was Gabriel and his voice was unnervingly calm for a man who ostensibly had a gun pointed at him, &ldquo;but even if I did know where he went I wouldn't tell you. You could shoot me, but I really rather you didn't. I've been honest with you when I said that I'm just a simple potter. You can have a look at the wheel if you like.&rdquo;</span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	Leave it to Gabe to try and make small talk to an armed hunter, Vincent wasn't going to take that chance. Judging by the two voices he had already mapped out their position in the living room and when he came out of the hallway he made sure he was facing the armed one of the two. &ldquo;Marcus, what in the </span><i>hell</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> are you doing in my home?&rdquo;</span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	If Marcus was surprised to see Vincent he didn't show it, instead he kept his gun level with the werewolf's chest and only moved his eyes to greet the pale former partner. &ldquo;Doing your job, Vince. I knew you weren't being honest with me, but I didn't know just how </span><i>sick</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> you really are. You know how I had to find this out?&rdquo; When Vincent didn't make a motion to answer his voice became a growl. &ldquo;</span><i>Do you?!</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">&rdquo; </span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;If you're angry with me then point the gun at me Marcus, if you haven't already.&rdquo; The thing about guns that really troubled Vincent was their unpredictability. A blade moved slow enough and with enough warning that he could generally defend or at the very least deflect them, but a bullet was silent until released and the time in between was so marginal that there was no way to doge except by dumb luck or a shoddy aim. </span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;Vincent...&rdquo; this time it was Gabriel and his voice was cautionary. </span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;Shut up, both of you. I can't believe you, man. After all those bullshit talks you gave about duty and loyalty and look at you. </span><i>Look at you</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">. You're </span><i>living</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> with one of them, and don't try to bullshit me now about not knowing. I know you're too smart for that, so I got to ask myself how does a man as smart as you, Vince, end up doing something this goddamn </span><i>stupid</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">.&rdquo; </span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	Vincent took a step forward and to his left to slowly and gradually place himself between Marcus and Gabriel. There was still a chance he could talk his old partner out of this but if he failed he wanted that failure to result in his own injury and not Gabe's. &ldquo;I know you're not willing to understand this right now Marcus but we've been wrong. We've been operating on an assumption and that assumption is flawed and once you uncover a truth like that you can't turn around and walk away. What I've said to you about duty and loyalty wasn't bullshit, Marcus, I've just placed my duty and loyalty to the truth and not to the Order. The two are not as inseparable as you've been lead to think &ndash; as I was lead to think. Put the gun down and I'll explain it to you.&rdquo;</span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;I'm not putting this gun </span><i>anywhere</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> until that thing is dead. I'm going to give you the chance to do it yourself and save you from whatever the hell it is you think you're doing that's right. You know what they are capable of, you know what they've done. You keep a silver blade in your boot holster, pull it out and I'll make sure he doesn't move. Prove to me, Vince, that you're not as sick and twisted as I think you are, prove to me there's something left in there that I can recognize.&rdquo;</span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	Gabriel hadn't said a word and Vincent could almost hear a bemused sort of chuckle that generally served as his all purpose response when a serious one was called for. He knew the answer before it was a question &ndash; he could not and would not lift a blade to Gabriel ever again. &ldquo;No. I'm not a puppet any longer. I'm not going to follow orders simply because they are orders and neither should you, Marcus. Think for yourself and then ask me to kill my own friend in cold blood, because I'm damn sure if you were thinking for yourself and not just ignorantly following orders you'd never ask me to do something like that ever again. You may have an issue with me and my decisions but let's make one thing clear, you </span><i>are</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> going to answer my next question. What has Gabriel done to warrant death? </span><i>Specifically</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> what has </span><i>he</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> done, don't rattle off a list of what his kind have done or so help me I'll bring up a history lesson you'll not want to hear about.&rdquo;</span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	Silence was his only response for a long moment and quietly Vincent feared Marcus was making up his mind whether or not to just shoot him. It wouldn't be all that far fetched, the man never did like getting into debates with him &ndash; usually because Vincent ended up wining. &ldquo;It's not about what he </span><i>has</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> done it's about what he </span><i>will </i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> do, you know that. Ever damn first year brat in the division knows that. He's a monster and monsters don't just sit around and make pots.&rdquo;</span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;Mugs, actually,&rdquo; Gabriel chimed in with a tone of voice that was better suited for sharing the news at breakfast over a cup of coffee. &ldquo;Sometimes I sculpt, too.&rdquo;</span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	Vincent decided now was a good time to interrupt before Marcus started shooting out of frustrated rage. He could somewhat sympathize with him, Gabriel had a calmness about him that could be more than a little frustrating when you needed to have a serious conversation. &ldquo;I know we've never had this problem for obvious reasons, Marcus, but I'm sure you'll know what I'm talking about when I mention race. You once told me you respected my friendship because I never judged you by the color of your skin, I thought it was a rather absurd concept to judge someone before you got to know them. I compared it to hating an individual for the sound of their voice alone and no other criteria. You asked me how I could do something as stupid as befriend an enemy, I'm asking myself how I could be so stupid to call him my enemy in the first place.&rdquo; Vincent took another step forward.</span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	 &ldquo;We boast about our social maturity by comparing ourselves to the past, taking pride in the fact that our races are finally starting that long road down to tolerance and understanding and yet here you are ready to kill a man over nothing but his constitution. You're no different from a common racist killing a man by his skin color alone. If you do this, if you kill either one of us based on nothing but your own bigotry then you're no different from the people you grew up to hate. Put that </span><i>damn</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> gun down, Marcus, I know you're a better man than this.&rdquo;</span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;This is </span><i>different</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">!&rdquo; Marcus growled, his fingers tightening over the gun he held in his hand. Who was this blind son of a bitch to tell him who he was? He didn't know what it was like to grow up ashamed of yourself and your family because that's what you were taught to feel by those in power around you. He didn't know what it was like to have a gang of white punks beat the hell out of him for doing nothing but walking down the street at night. Who was </span><i>he</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> to judge him? This was different than racial unrest, this was about the survival of humanity. &ldquo;Don't talk about shit you know nothing about. This is it, Vincent, I'm drawing the line &ndash; you cross it and I'm not responsible for what happens to you. Make your choice.&rdquo;</span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	Vincent had let him keep talking as he moved a little closer now and did everything he could think of to make himself look as if he was truly contemplating what Marcus had to say. Just a little more and &ndash; there, perfect. The air around him suddenly became more detailed to his senses. Every brush of fabric, every cool motion of the air fed him information that his eyes couldn't. When Vincent struck he did so like a serpent that had been very carefully coiled to not give any hint of an attack away until it was too late. Pivoting onto his right foot as his anchor his left whipped up and around in a wide enough arc to catch Marcus' gun arm and bat it aside. The shot that rang out went wide of him and ostensibly into the wooden floor, harmlessly embedding itself there. Vincent didn't give Marcus any time to re-aim and was on him in an instant letting his training take over his movements. A flat hand jabbed out with the prone fingertips to jab into the soft yet sturdy ridges of Marcus' neck choking off his airway. The distraction wouldn't last long but it was enough to make a grab for the pistol.</span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	Vincent hated guns but he wasn't about to debate their value when faced with having one used against him. Unfortunately, Marcus wasn't so willing to give the weapon up without a fight. The blow he had felt coming but didn't have enough time to react to hit him square in the jaw. A hand reached out to grab onto something to sturdy his balance and found Marcus' shirt. The momentum of the failed attempt to doge coupled with the blow sent both men toppling awkwardly to the floor, knocking over the end table and lamp in the process. Marcus was the bigger of the two but Vincent had managed to twist them as they fell to remain more or less on top. The gun was still in Marcus' hand and prying fingers from both sides were vying for ultimate control when the sound of a gunshot, muffled by its position between the two, erupted.</span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	For a long moment Vincent couldn't tell which of them had been shot, but slowly he began to feel the damaged nerves relaying their messages of pain past the dull haze of shock that clouded his perception.  An involuntary cough brought up the familiar metallic taste and most of it was spat into Marcus' chest. The battle for the gun was forgotten and he let himself roll off of Marcus and onto his back. He was distantly aware of his name being yelled as one hand lifted to his abdomen to search through the warm wetness to verify to himself that he had indeed just been shot. </span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	Marcus pushed Vincent the rest of the way off and got to his feet with a look of utter disgust on his features. The damn son of a bitch just got blood all over his shirt. Lifting the now slick with blood gun he pointed it at Vincent's defenseless chest heaving up and down in labored attempts to catch his breath. Anger rose up in him, an anger unlike anything he'd ever felt before in his life. He was angry that his friend had betrayed him, angry that he had betrayed him for one of </span><i>them</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">. The gun fired off two more rounds and Vincent's labored attempts became wheezing gasps. For the love of-- he missed! From point blank range he missed making the killing blow. His hand was just about to correct for the aim when a blur of motion took him </span><i>hard </i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> down to the ground. </span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	A mixture of skin and fur met him and he reasonably concluded that the beast had finally shown his true colors. A shame Vincent was going to miss being proved wrong about this 'Gabriel' he thought was his friend. He gave a long cry as razor sharp claws dug into his shoulder but despite how hard he was trying he couldn't get his gun arm unpinned from the half transformed beast. Claws dug deeper and he was certain that if he didn't do something and soon he was going to die but just as suddenly as the attack started it was finished. &ldquo;What the...&rdquo;</span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;I've severed the tendons in your arm, you won't be able to use that gun,&rdquo; Gabriel all but hissed in explanation, &ldquo;and no matter how much I want to kill you right now I'm not about to give you that satisfaction. Now, </span><i>get out</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">.&rdquo; </span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	It was something Marcus couldn't explain. Instead of ripping him bit by bit to shreds, Gabriel had turned his back to him after only causing minimal damage in comparison to his potential. Not only had the wolf turned his back on the armed hunter but he was now down on the floor cradling Vincent in his arms hunched over the fallen hunter. With a groan and a wince he got to his feet, bewildered by the surreal sight before him. A lycan holding a dying hunter and...weeping over him? </span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	&ldquo;</span><i>Get out! Just get out!</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">&rdquo; Gabriel's voice was a mixture of anger and pain but something else was there just beneath the surface; a plea. It was bad enough that he had the temptation to kill the man but to watch his first real friend in a long while die was more than he could handle. If Marcus didn't leave soon he wasn't sure if he could hold back the temptation to rip his throat out with his bare teeth. Vincent was shaking and it didn't seem possible but he had become even more pale than usual. Crimson stains blossomed all over his chest until his silk shirt was nothing but a sea of red and the blood that had come from his mouth stood out sharply against his porcelain skin. He didn't have any words to say and with Vincent's eyes rolled back he hardly was in a condition to hear them anyway. It wasn't until he saw the knife strapped to Vincent's belt that an old fact filtered its way up from his memories. With a missed heart beat he reached for the weapon and held his breath as he drew it. Steel, he hoped was the blade's making and upon touching it to his skin he found that he was right when it didn't sizzle and burn. </span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	Laying Vincent back down on the floor he ripped open his silken shirt to expose his pale and wounded chest. Taking a steadying breath, Gabriel brought the blade to his wrist, looking for all the world like some fatalistic lover ready to die beside his Juliet. He made a mental note to thank Vincent later for keeping his weapons in such great condition that it only took a slight bit of pressure to cut down into a vein. Lycans had no real danger of bleeding to death but their blood contained properties of healing and if ever there was a time to spill blood for a just cause that time was now. Rivets of crimson blood flowed down over his clenched fist and one by one the drops began to fall onto the open wounds. </span></p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	Vincent bucked and stiffened with a choked cry and the once limp hands at his sides dug so fiercely into the wooden floor that his nails bent far enough back to rip and bleed. &ldquo;</span><i>God</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">!&rdquo; He had regained just enough consciousness to try and piece together what was taking place. A searching hand lifted to find Gabriel's still bleeding arm and fist and clarity began to form in his mind. Gabe was trying to use his blood to heal him but Vincent knew better. &ldquo;C-can't,&rdquo; he gasped through the pain of trying to force air from his lungs hard enough to make a sound. &ldquo;Bullets...sil--&rdquo; the effort forced a wet cough that threatened to drown him, &ldquo;silver. You can't...Gabe...&rdquo;</span></p></lj-cut><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Edit: Added Ilya's part in all of this and finished the scene. Wow, I've actually completed something.

<![endif]-->  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Ilya had stayed a little longer at the cafe than Vincent, preferring to sit and enjoy the bustling city of New York at night with a hot cup of tea. It wasn't anything like Moscow and that made it exotic and alive to his senses and worth a bit of indulgence. It was when he had finished with his lingering that he noticed the little folded up metallic case sitting just at the other end of the table where Vincent had been sitting. A subtle sort of an expression touched his lips, undoubtedly Vincent wouldn't even know it was missing - the blind man never seemed to have a great need for visual aids. It was almost uncanny how he could move himself in a way that gave the impression he could see his surroundings when Ilya knew better. <br /> <br /> Giving the instrument a considerate glance he purposefully rose to his feet and snatched up the metallic case to pocket. Ilya was not a Praotet of his House for trivial reasons, it wasn't difficult at all to reach out with his extra senses and pick up Vincent's trail by scent alone. He <em><span style=""font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"">could</span></em> reach out mentally and just pinpoint Vincent that way but he was almost positive that the Hunter had mental blocks of protection from that kind of tampering, and despite being a vampire Ilya did have a sense of decency that kept him from invading the privacy of someone he respected. Lower members of his House never got that kind of respect, nor did he completely trust all of them to their own privacy. <br /> <br /> The path was not difficult to follow though he was a little surprised by the environment the other chose to live in. Then again, Vincent couldn't see the lack of aesthetic value his neighborhood possessed so perhaps it made a little more sense when keeping that in mind. It still clashed with Ilya&rsquo;s picture of the man who enjoyed Tolstoy, Tchaikovsky, and intelligent debate over politics to live in a place less than suitable for a common working class citizen. As he kept following the trail deeper into the slum-like conditions he caught scent of something much more shocking than the atmosphere. Blood. Specifically, Vincent&rsquo;s blood and it was fresh. Ilya&rsquo;s nostrils flared with both surprise and concern. Vincent by no means was a man who needed taking care of but the scent of his blood was strong and only became stronger as his pace quickened toward the source.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">It wasn&rsquo;t long before his light walk turned into more of a gait and by the time he reached the apartment with the front door thrown wide the scent of blood choked his nostrils. There were faint sounds coming from within the first room to his right upon entering the long hallway full of numbered apartment doors, whimpered sort of noises that turned into voices upon his approach.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;Vincent&hellip;what&hellip;what am I supposed to <i style="""">do</i> then?&rdquo; If his blood couldn&rsquo;t heal these wounds then they were quite possibly beyond hope. Getting him to a hospital would take far too long and at the rate he was losing blood he&rsquo;d surely die en route.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;N-nothing,&rdquo; Vincent gasped, fighting for just a few more moments of consciousness despite the void that was beckoning to him ever stronger with each passing moment. Each breath wracked his chest with pain so each breath became more shallow and ragged than the last.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Ilya paused only a moment at seeing Vincent, covered in his own blood, being cradled in the arms of a &ndash; his nostrils flared again at catching this creature&rsquo;s scent. A lycan. A flash of anger was forcibly suppressed in favor of gaining information rather than a fight and by the looks of Vincent&rsquo;s condition he didn&rsquo;t have time to start an argument.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;Vincent?&rdquo; Ilya inquired, ignoring the Lycan&rsquo;s obvious shock at someone interrupting the tense moment. &ldquo;What has happened to you?&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Vincent&rsquo;s eyes were half lidded with the attempt to keep them open but his head moved slightly in response to his name being said by someone other than Gabe. He recognized it right away but though his lips formed the name his voice was absent. It was simply too difficult to force the air out of his lungs hard enough to make a sound.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Though Gabriel kept quite his eyes were glaring upward at this intruder with the silent question speaking loud enough for him in his lack of a verbal inquiry. <i style="""">Who are you?</i> Gabriel knew exactly what he was and the two shared a look of animosity that was skewed more toward Ilya&rsquo;s side than coming from Gabriel&rsquo;s. He knew Vampires were none too fond of his kind but never indulged himself in the conflicts between the two, opting to enjoy his pottery and life without adding the complications of prejudice.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;That is not important,&rdquo; Ilya dismissed Gabriel with his voice and eyes, the steel grey hues were now downcast and searching out Vincent&rsquo;s deathly pale features. His brow furrowed with thought but now was not the time to be hesitant. There was a solution but it had to be Vincent&rsquo;s choice, Ilya felt strongly enough about that to make it unbreakable rule in his House. No human could be turned without express consent and only after approval by the Praotet himself. He was very careful as to whom he allowed into his fold and while Vincent would be a valuable addition the fact still remained that it had to be the Hunter&rsquo;s choice and Vincent was rapidly losing his ability to make conscious decisions.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Kneeling, Ilya assertively took Vincent from Gabriel&rsquo;s arms &ndash; casting the Lycan a look that told him not to interfere despite his inclinations to do just that. &ldquo;Vincent,&rdquo; Ilya&rsquo;s voice was full of the assertiveness he displayed with his body language earlier, forcing the Hunter&rsquo;s attention toward himself, &ldquo;make your choice. I can save you but it <i style="""">must</i> be your will.&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">The only response was a faint wheeze of pain and Vincent&rsquo;s eyes threatened to roll back. The call to unconsciousness was a Siren&rsquo;s beckon and it was all too powerful to resist for much longer.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;<i style="""">Vincent</i>,&rdquo; Ilya hissed, fangs bared in preparation. &ldquo;I need an answer.&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">The call proved to be more powerful than Vincent had the power to fight against and his head lolled to the side, eyes rolled back to show the whites. Ilya&rsquo;s gaze settled on the Lycan and a thinly sculpted brow jaunted upward in question. &ldquo;Perhaps you know him well enough to give the consent? I find it distasteful that he should be in the care of your kind but I am at an impasse.&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Gabriel probably looked as shocked as he felt. The insult to his &lsquo;kind&rsquo; was ignored or brushed off without much thought. How could he make this kind of a choice for Vincent? Of course he wanted his friend to live but at what cost? &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t my price to pay,&rdquo; Gabriel answered, his voice reflecting the pain in his features. To live barely alive or to die, who was to say which the better of the two was? Certainly his own cursed life was a burden and not one he&rsquo;d lightly thrust upon a friend. Perhaps it was better to watch Vincent die, as painful as it was.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;Unacceptable,&rdquo; came Ilya&rsquo;s harsh reply, his eyes narrowed slits of silver. &ldquo;I need an answer, <i style="""">Lycan</i>. You are perhaps close enough to him to satisfy me of that and I do not have the time to waste on your indecisiveness.&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Anger, an uncommon sensation, flared up in Gabriel&rsquo;s gut and feral instinct tried to tempt him toward violence. Reason was restored with a calming breath and the feral voice became nothing more than a whisper. For a long moment he battled with the decision that had to be made. What would Vincent want? If he had to make this choice then he would have to do it without his own bias getting in the way. Finally his head dropped and his eyes shut themselves in silent agreement.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">It was enough for Ilya even if it was a rather unsatisfactory response. He liked &lsquo;yeses&rsquo; to be yes and &lsquo;no&rsquo;s&rsquo; to be no&rsquo;s. The Lycan looked physically pained to be making such a decision but Ilya surmised it to be weakness on his part and paid it no more attention than he would the weather, which incidentally had become a small downpour just outside. With a combination of pulling Vincent&rsquo;s limp form upward and lowering his head down for his neck, fangs met flesh and easily pierced through to bring two flowing spurts of blood into his mouth. A balance had to be made between taking enough blood to start the rite of change but not taking so much that Vincent died before it could be completed. Once Ilya swallowed enough of the copper tasting fluid he licked the dual wounds closed and just as easily pierced his fangs down into his own wrist, letting welts of dark blood swell and drip into Vincent&rsquo;s positioned and open mouth. He&rsquo;d have to swallow the blood for this to work and at the angle his head was being held at it should be enough for gravity to take the role Vincent could not.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">For a long moment nothing happened and Ilya began to have his doubts that he had made it in time. Vincent only grew more ashen. Out of the corner of his vision he could see that the Lycan had looked up with a nervous frown tugging at his lips. With his brow furrowed, Ilya let a few more drops spill out but had a mind to withdraw completely in defeat. There was no sense in drawing this out if Vincent was already dead. Before he could pull away there was a sound that stayed his hand. A rasping gasp cut through the dead silence that had been hanging between the trio. Vincent&rsquo;s chest rose and the veins of his neck and temple stood out like raised rivers on a map. In one moment Vincent had begun the process of losing his need to breathe yet in the very next all he could do was scream.</p></meta></meta></meta></meta></div><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  </p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">	</span></p></meta></meta>"

"event","Hope kept his feet moving when his mind knew better. Hope told him that everything was going to be alright when common sense said that nothing was anymore. The two voices vied heavily for dominance in his thoughts as he made the twenty minute walk trembling from the cold rain and fear. Did he really want to know? Wasn't it much easier to hope? Hoping without knowing any better was comforting, but hoping while knowing what the truth might be was folly. His feet kept him moving. <br /><br />It was only a small sliver of a view but it won the battle in his thoughts. The roof of his homestead peeked just out over the hilly landscape. Tinted gray from the encroaching dusk, the scene before him after alighting the last hill was serene and bone chilling. He hardly noticed the now constant pattering of freezing rain. The air was still, enough so that for a moment he felt as if he were looking down on a picture. Up until now his resolve had not faltered, his feet had kept him moving, but it was hard to will himself down that hill. <br /><br />His voice sounded foreign to him; small and timid. &quot;Elise? Mama, Papa, don't tell me you are still here.&quot; It was far too quiet for anyone to be in this house. That is, anyone who was still alive. With the house standing and very little damage around in the field and surrounding area it was more than likely that they had already left like he had asked - no pleaded - them to. Relief made him give a nervous laugh at himself as he propped his travel weary form against the door. Of course they had left. What had he been thinking?<br /><br />Through the coming onset of night he could see something in the field that caught his eye. At first it was just a misshapen heap but as his eyes adjusted he could make out the horrifying details. Fraise was laying just off to the side of the house, her twisted form shielded by the structure on his approach was now fully visible. The horse had been Elise's bridal dowry but everyone knew it was her horse. He could remember her as a young girl brushing it's reddish coat for hours. Her black eyes were still open and it was obvious that she had struggled as she died. He'd seen this kind of death before. The lack of physical damage now didn't seem to matter at all, it only served to amplify the dread. Gas.<br /><br />&quot;Elise!&quot; He was barging down the door, eyes wild and searching. Relief no where to be found. The family room with the fireplace looked untouched. If they had left surely they would have taken a picture and a few valuables with them. Unless they left in a panic or a hurry. Or unless they didn't leave at all. Warren's heart was beating furiously and wildly without any sense of rhythm when his eyes trailed to the long hallway and the half opened door caught on something he couldn't see but knew deep down what it was. A trembling hand reached out for the wall as he unwillingly brought himself into view.<br /><br />The floor must have shook, because he ended up on it in an instant after seeing her sprawling form. The blood was rushing so hard in his ears that he could barely hear his own screaming. His world narrowed to the short distance between them that might as well have been the span of continents. He couldn't stand and three times on his way over he had to stop to catch his breath. Crawling, he made his way over to her. <br /><br />Numb hands traced over cold skin until they found her shoulders. The door swung open as he collapsed down beside his wife and both of his arms engulfed her body. She was cold but not yet rigid with death, it wouldn't register until later that she hadn't died all that long before he had gotten to her. There wasn't any room for guilt to enter his thoughts. Thoughts that were mostly empty. Nothing prepared you for how to think during grief. <br /><br />He'd never wept so hard as he did lying there on the wooden floor with her body in his arms, her hair covering his face. She still smelled like he remembered on their wedding night. Like lilies. It wouldn't be for a very long handful of minutes before his eyes reopened to the darkening house around him. Thoughts began to take coherence again and his mind tried desperately to focus on analyzing facts instead of reeling from grief. She was laying in the doorway when she died, her body was facing inwards toward the room and not outward as he might expect from someone who should have been trying to get out. No, it was more like she was trying to get <em>to</em> something. His heart quit beating entirely.<br /><br />Slowly, his eyes lifted from the ground and into the room toward the crib standing at the foot of what would have been their bed. As if in a drunken stupor he got to his feet, falling against the door frame for support before he dared to venture any further. Small items were all laid out on the bed. A blanket, tiny clothing, and a small toy. In the corner of the room an open luggage caught his eye for just a moment before he willed himself further in. It was the slowest meter and a half he ever crossed.<br /><br />The infant was deceptively still, but he didn't dare to hope. He knew better by now that hope was an evil and malevolent force at work, at least in this part of France. He couldn't help it, his hand reached down into the handmade crib to caress the soft down-like hair, tears unwillingly spilling down over the child. The blanket that covered the body was hand stitched with &quot;Mattieu&quot; scrawling across in what he recognized as his mother's work. It was the same blanket they had wrapped his youngest brother in when he was this small. Neither of them lived very long, in some way it was morbidly fitting. <br /><br />Warren's finger traveled over his son's tiny replicas while his other hand gripped the crib in support. The enraged yell took time to accumulate, but it didn't need all that much instigation after this. He felt it boiling in his gut and in the back of his mind he heard a laugh. By the time it was over his throat was raw and it had accomplished very little. <br /><br />&quot;Why?!&quot; His attention was aimed upward and if looks could kill heaven would be worried. The only answer he got was a burning sensation around his neck that grew from just peculiar pinpricks of pain to unbearable in the span of a man's breath. The hand that reached put to yank the necklace off came back singed in the outline of a cross. Perhaps he had cursed the heavens a little too enthusiastically, but if it had just stopped at that he would have considered himself lucky. The sensation from before was back and stronger. <br /><br />[Aaaaand, not done, but I&nbsp;have to go so I'm posting this now.]<br /><br />"

"event","With the boys and the truck gone his attention was brought forcefully back to his surroundings. The temptation to give into the sinking feeling in his gut was almost unbearable. Thoughts began to race. How far does this damage go? How many shells came this close to my family? Hope, an elusive creature, saw herself fit to perch in his ear and whisper back to the questions. Beaumont is a small village, she said, easily missed by invaders. Your family is smart enough to know when to leave, the voice continued, they wouldn't have stayed if it had been this close. <br /><br />The few kilometers from the main road to Beaumont were tense. Everything he recognized was now unrecognizable in many respects. Before the war it took a better part of a man's day to cross this stretch of forest, now, with all the trees either gone or reduced to stumps, it didn't take long at all. His mind unwillingly snapped to the past. Images of his younger self running wild through this once forested area playing make believe soldier with his older brother and neighborhood friends. An unexplained anger rose in the back of his throat and he cursed himself for having been so naive. There was nothing fun about war and glory became meaningless in the face of this much devastation. <br /><br />His side and neck ached but they were not enough to keep him from running. The build up and suspense was torturous and if he didn't find out soon how his family was he felt as if he could quite possibly explode. As if to punctuate his thoughts the blast of artillery fire sounded from far to his east. It was a very sobering sound and as he stopped to catch his breath and rest his thoughts traveled back to the young boys on that caravan headed for the front lines. He was not the only one in France to fear for his family's safety. Not by far, not even close. <br /><br />He would have to pass through Beaumont to get to his family's farmstead further north and it was perhaps this detour that panicked him the most. It wasn't until his foot hit what he thought was a rock before he realized he was standing in what had been the center of the small village. Leveled was perhaps the military description for it, and the first to come to mind, but it could not accurately depict the wasteland he was standing on. Shock kept him from feeling the full brunt of the emotional shock wave. His brain simply could not wrap itself around this much loss and devastation. Finally his eyes settled downward onto the half remaining sign he had stumbled into. Only the 'Beau' was showing and the irony sneered upward from the blackened remains. There was nothing 'beautiful' here. Not any more. <br /><br />With his chest tightening painfully he knew he had to continue on, the answers were just a twenty minute walk from where he stood and despite the chill that warned him of what he might find he had to know. In the back of his mind he could feel something stirring, some long dormant anger or perhaps a personality that had until now been repressed. It was a buzz of static in his thoughts that he didn't need right now and with some effort he ignored it, but it did not ignore him. <br /><div style=""text-align: center;"">***</div><div style=""text-align: left;""><br /><strong>Command HQ, Outskirts of Verdun, France</strong><br /><br />Maurice hefted a light sigh as the very attractive young nurse attended his leg. &quot;I'm telling you I&nbsp;can't feel a thing, it's fine. Though I wouldn't mind if those hands kept exploring.&quot; He expected a slap but all he got was a distant glance. It drove home to him just how 'shell shocked' these people were. It was a bad day for France when a man couldn't even flirt with a pretty woman any more.<br /><br />&quot;Not feeling pain is a sign of nerve damage. I&nbsp;can't sign your release forms,&quot; she finally concluded after a wasted ten minutes examining the barbed wire wounds he received nearly a month ago. He'd nearly torn off his leg and the still healing wound wrapped itself like a serpent around his calf and thigh. <br /><br />&quot;Look, mon cher, it's either I die in here or I&nbsp;die out there. I'd prefer not to die at all but we never do get that choice, do we? I can walk just fine, I've even ran on it. What good does it do me to sit around? If they are worried about my health then they should not have sent me to war, no?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I'm sorry, I can't sign your release forms.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;I heard you the first time. Fine, if you won't let me leave to the front will you at least let me leave this god forsaken hospital?&quot; He expected sarcasm in return, perhaps even anger, but the only response was for her to step back and allow him room to get off the makeshift examining table. Her eyes were fairly vacant and he realized she had seen far too much for his sarcasm to even register. It wasn't just the injured soldiers who came back from the war wounded. He imagined even in the cities far away from this turmoil in France there would still be the vacant eyes of those who have seen too much tragedy. When would it end?<br /><br />Those gloomy and depressive thoughts followed him outside of the hospital and he had half a mind to chase them away with a strong shot or two of whiskey. He hadn't meant to eavesdrop at the command headquarters but the two officers arguing were outside and just in earshot and the topic was one that immediately got his attention. Slinking between the buildings he was just close enough to make out what they were saying without making it obvious he was listening in. <br /><br />&quot;How many villages?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;At last count...5, sir. All shelled.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;<em>Mon Dieu</em>. How are the evacuations of the remaining villages going?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Slowly. The roads are completely destroyed and many families don't want to leave. Our last reports only show a small percentage of people evacuated. In my personal opinion, I&nbsp;don't think we should continue wasting man power and time on those who won't accept our help.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I'm not sure it's that simple, Major. None of us expected for them to attack civilians like this.&quot; Maurice could hear the sigh in the man's voice. &quot;Have your men do what they can and then return to the front. You're right, we can't spare the troops on stubborn farmers.&nbsp;If this line falls, France falls. It's the cost of war.&quot;<br /><br />Cost of war. The words kept echoing in his head even as the two officers went on discussing other subjects. Men, women and children were reduced to a mere price tag. None of it was right, but a part of him knew it was the logical thing to do. The wheels in his mind kept turning until a stray thought jarred the works completely. Warren.<br /><br />&quot;Excuse me!&quot; Maurice produced himself from around the corner and stood directly in front of the two ranking officers. &quot;I need to know if Beaumont was one of those villages. Yes I&nbsp;could hear you and that is not the point,&quot;&nbsp;he responded before either of them could question him. They were standing outside, after all, what privacy could they honestly expect?<br /><br />The Major frowned and turned to his notes, flipping a page and reading down through the list. &quot;Yes. Beaumont was the most recent. Completely leveled. I'm sorry if you have family there.&quot;<br /><br />Maurice could feel his face paling. &quot;I don't, but my friend does and he's headed there on leave. Permission to retrieve the lieutenant, sir?&quot; It was worth a shot.<br /><br />&quot;What is your status? Are you on rotation?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Not exactly. I'm on medical leave but I&nbsp;swear I&nbsp;can make it on my own to Beaumont and back.&quot; Maurice could tell they didn't look convinced. &quot;Look. No man should have to hear the news his family is dead much less be there to witness the aftermath alone. You know what I'd do if I&nbsp;lost everything I'd been fighting for?&quot;<br /><br />Silence hung for a moment. &quot;Go on...&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I'm still thinking. I don't really know what I'd do. Point is, I&nbsp;know what a man like Lieutenant Bancroft would do and believe me when I say you can't really afford to lose a good man like him.&quot; <br /><br />A breathless few moments passed before the Colonel nodded. &quot;This is technically a violation, but I&nbsp;can see where the argument of extenuating circumstances has merit. Just know that your life and his are both forfeit out there. We do not have the men to spare to come to your aid should you require it.&quot;</div><div style=""text-align: left;""><br />&quot;Understood, completely. Frankly, I'd rather be out there doing what good I can until&nbsp;I expire. You're a good man. You're both good men.&quot; <br /><br />His run was more of a hobble as he left the city outskirts and headed north for Beaumont. Warren had at least a good hour head start on him and he'd been riding in a truck. The math was clear - he wouldn't make it in time to warn his friend but he'd be damned if he didn't make in time to support him through it. <br />&nbsp;</div><br />"

"event","Outside of the makeshift command barracks, made out of torn and twisted sheets of metal, a soldier gives an ill-conceived celebratory leap. In his hand, rolled up to protect it from the elements, is his greatest possession on him at the moment; his granted request for a week's leave. Pain racked his side, he quite possibly ripped a few stitches out with that victory jump, but nothing - not even the constant rain - could dampen his spirits; he was going home. After 8 months of war, he was going home.<br /><br />&quot;Renarde! You are leaving us?&quot; It was the voice of a friend running up to greet him. His smile seemed to be bigger than Warren's felt, the mark of a true friend.<br /><br />&quot;Only for a few days. France can hold the line that long, no?&quot; He was practically glowing with excited energy.<br /><br />&quot;She has me, she'll hold until the last boche in Germany tries to cross that line. What have you heard from Elise? Has she produced a handsome little devil yet?&quot; Maurice stepped up his pace to keep up with Warren's excited but loping trot. He had to shake his head with a partial and bemused smile at his friend's lack of a regard for his own health. Though it had to be noted that Warren had been healing much faster than anyone expected. Even the long gash around his neck was already fading into a scar. It just went to prove what kind of a soldier the man was, he figured.<br /><br />&quot;No word yet, but the post has been slow, she may have already had the baby,&quot;&nbsp;Warren sounded a little hopeful that she had not.<br /><br />&quot;Easy, Renarde, you look like you're planning on running all the way there,&quot;&nbsp;Maurice said with a laugh to punctuate it.<br /><br />&quot;I&nbsp;feel like I could! Ah, Maurice, you have no idea how -- I don't even know how to say it! I'm going to be a father. That's it. That's all there is to say.&quot; The thought of having to kiss both Elise and their new child goodbye would not even enter his thoughts. Caught up in his excitement, Warren grabs a hold of Maurice for a hug - a gesture his friend readily reciprocates. <br /><br />&quot;Now you&nbsp; have me worried!&nbsp;I&nbsp;believe you plan on leaving me here alone, Lieutenant.&quot; Maurice held his chin high with the mock accusation for effect.&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;And let you take all the glory when we win?&quot; Warren snorted with a wide smile. &quot;Don't count on it just yet.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Those medals have my name on them, why else would I&nbsp;be so eager to get you out of here?&quot; The younger soldier's hand reached out to clap his Lieutenant's before sliding to rap once on his back. &quot;Now go on, get going! Give Elise a good kiss for me and try not to get too jealous when she likes it better than your usual~!&quot;<br /><br />The caravan heading north to the front lines had just enough room for a homesick soldier on leave to tag along. His excitement only peaked through in the smile he was currently trying to fight back, but it was getting progressively easier as the countryside he called home became more and more bleak. As the convoy rumbled along slowly through partially destroyed roads the view changed around them - a warning of the horrors to come. Once rolling hills of emerald were now reduced to little more than mud strewn heaps of wounded earth. Excitement had quickly given away to anxiety and it must have become obvious because the young soldiers sitting around him grew fidgety with seeing an officer go from barely contained joy to this state.<br /><br />&quot;Is it as bad as they say out there,&quot; one of the young men asked with his voice betraying just how young he really was. Warren was startled when he took a closer look at the boy, he couldn't have been older than 16.<br /><br />It took a moment but he tore his thoughts from his own personal troubles and felt the full impact of the question these kids were all too terrified to ask; <em>are we going to die</em>? Perhaps it was the anticipation of becoming a father that made his gut reaction urge him to tell these boys that everything would be alright, but he steeled himself to that temptation. They deserved the truth.<br /><br />&quot;It's worse,&quot; the Lieutenant in him answered gruffly but honestly. He made it a point to look every last one of them in the eyes and matched their horror and wide eyed fear with stern experience. &quot;Right now, look around you. These are now your best friends. You will never forget any of the faces right here before you. See this?&quot; His hand reached out to the boy sitting next to him, indicating his ears. &quot;These are your ears, these are your eyes. Your back is his back, your life is his life. You had better get all the individuality you have out of your system before you reach that line. What is your name, son?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Gilles Lambert, sir.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Not any more. There isn't a line you stand on out there, you <em>are</em> the line. You, the man next to you, every single body on that front are the only thing that stands between those boche and your home. You don't watch straight ahead of you, you watch to your left and to your right. You watch every man's back and he watches yours because you aren't an individual any longer. If you let the man next to you die it is a sure bet you're next. Keep your heads down when you walk in the trenches, a moving helmet is an easy target.&quot; He was racking his brain to think of all the advice he could tell them before they had to part a few kilometers up the road at his stop. &quot;Don't eat anything that touches trench water and try not to look down too often at what is floating in there.&quot;&nbsp;Finally he ran out of steam and they all sat in contemplative silence while the view outside grew worse with every meter they crossed. <br /><br />&quot;I have been through more rotations than I'd like to count and remember,&quot; Warren concluded as the convoy rolled slowly to a stop and he knew this was where he'd have to make it to Beaumont on his own. &quot;Stick to the men beside you and you'll be home in no time.&quot; Their faces were still bleak when he alighted the ground out of the back of the truck and he stood along the road to wave them off until they turned around a damaged hill and were gone from sight. <br /><br />"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am overjoyed to receive your letters. So many have been coming back to our neighbors and none bring good news. The Fourniers lost both of their sons and their youngest has come down with a terrible fever, we fear they might lose him too. Your father has been in town all week with the repair effort but it is becoming clear that Beaumont will be lost. As you read this we have already begun to leave, most likely. I know in these times that getting the mail sent and delivered is not a top priority, it may be a month entirely before you get this. I&nbsp;do not dare to hope that by that time this will all be behind us. There is talk of heading for Verdun herself and if we can ever settle on where is best to flee to I&nbsp;will hope that I can find you when I arrive. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must confess that I am hesitant to travel. The baby could come at any time and the road is no place for a birth. Then again, neither is war but that cannot be helped. We should have left sooner, the roads are little more than cobble now. The horses will have to do, there is no possibility of leaving them behind. The poor beasts are as frightened as I've every seen them be from all the noise. One has already run off, Brune. She was my favorite, as you know. We'll have to make do with the other three, it should be enough for us to get to someplace safe. If such a place in France still exists. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain has been awful, I&nbsp;think of you out in it and worry for your health. Are you warm? Do you get enough to eat? When was the last time you've slept in a bed? There's more I think of but would not ask you, you've been through enough. I&nbsp;know you think of me, and you should know I&nbsp;think of you too. Your mother has been so generous and kind, I&nbsp;feel as if I am truly her daughter and despite circumstances Renaud fills this small home with laughter almost every night. We talk of&nbsp; you at dinner and it is obvious that he is proud. I know he wont say it but he misses you and Jacques terribly. We expected this to be a long war, but I don't think anyone quite anticipated it would be this long. Make it back, mon loup. Even if all of France is lost, make it back. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would write forever but there is work to be done. I&nbsp;hope when this reaches you that I will be close behind it. I will find you. I&nbsp;promise. I&nbsp;love you and I&nbsp;miss you.

With all of my heart,
Elise."

"event","To my sweet Elise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't have much to say, I fear. The weather is terrible and grows more bleak day after day. I&nbsp;lost my picture of you during the last scramble to the elements, if you have the chance to get another one taken I could really use the replacement. Maybe you could try and get in the vineyard for the background, I&nbsp;miss tending the fields. I&nbsp;miss a lot of things, really.&nbsp;Mostly you, and of course hot meals, but mostly you. I&nbsp;won't tell you about what's going on here, I don't want any of that in your head. Don't read the news, if you haven't already, none of it is good. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've put in a request for leave, if I've done my math correctly you're due in a month and I want to be home for the birth. I've yet to receive word on it, but I promise you'll be the first to know. If I can't make it home by then, I will eagerly await your correspondence at the first moment you can spare the time. I'm sure you've heard enough of my mother's lectures by now, she never seems to run out of advice. You are going to be a wonderful mother, I&nbsp;can only hope I'll be half as good as a father. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering the circumstances I am fairly confident I will get the leave time. I know I&nbsp;shouldn't tell you this, you'll worry, but it does improve my chances of getting home to see you. I've been shot. The bullet did a good job of missing most of my major organs, I'm telling you if it were a Frenchman on the other end of that gun I wouldn't be writing you at all. I won't be running any time soon, which is unfortunate because the rookies would very much like a football rematch. We beat them last month on our rotation off of battle. There's been talk of a tournament, anything to take our minds off of the trenches. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My biggest fear, the one that haunts me nightly, is that I&nbsp;will not be the man you married when I return. There will be no forgetting this. Any of it. I hope you are safe. I&nbsp;know none of you want to leave the farm but I can hear the thunder of artillery even now and I am miles away from the front lines. I&nbsp;know it is our home and our land but I will beg you again to reconsider staying. You are too close to all of this, far too close. I have looked at a map, Beaumont-en-Verdunois is under 20 kilometers away from this hell. Every minute this battle drags on is another minute I worry. I know you've made your decision clear but think of our child if you will not think of yourself. Your letters are a comfort, but they are not enough to persuade me that you're safe. Please, Elise, I&nbsp;will beg you if I&nbsp;needs must but I&nbsp;cannot bear the thought of losing you. I have already lost a brother and countless friends to this madness, I&nbsp;cannot lose you too. I&nbsp;can lose the land, it does not mean nearly half as much as what you mean to me. If you will not reconsider I will desert to come and find you. I would rather be a traitor than a widower. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None of this has been easy, but I promise you we'll make it through. I think of you always. 

With all my love, your husband at war,
Warren."

"event","I'm having far too much fun writing in the present tense but it would be really horrendous to do that for the entire novel. Therefore the backstories I&nbsp;write will be in that format and I&nbsp;think it works really well to separate it from the time frame the actual story takes place in. It's also more...ah...descriptive in the emotional sense? Something. Anyway, here's the first part of Warren's. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Wedded Bliss"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A soldier stands under a belv&eacute;d&egrave;re overlooking the sweeping coast of violet and green, but as beautiful as the view is his eyes are captive to the alluring woman standing in front of him at the altar. Her hair is shimmering in the glow of the afternoon sunlight and the pure white of her stunning dress outshines everything around them. Even with his perfectly pressed uniform on he feels inadequately dressed. He still cannot believe she has said yes, even with the rings sitting just before them waiting to be put on. Nervousness begins to over take him as the minister begins the ceremony and his eyes sweep out into the audience in search of his mother who is weeping silently in the front row. His father merely smiles and gives him a small hand gesture to turn back around and face his future wife. He understands the nervous feelings and is remembering back to his own wedding. His hand goes out to hold his wife's as they watch their son stumble over his vows.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bride beams a wide smile when her groom stutters his words and her light laugh only gives him more confidence that she is the woman he wants to spend the rest of his life with. With a clear throat now he manages to pick up the pace but falters when he arrives at the end where he tells her what she is worth to him. He promised himself he wouldn't cry but the tears fall despite it all, but his bride doesn't seem to notice even though she is staring straight into his eyes. His voice trembles over the last line of I love you. Where he ends she begins with her own words of commitment and love and he finds himself moved even harder to tears by her words. Even his father has succumb now to the moistening of his eyes and it's curious to see him trying to keep it from his wife who sits sobbing by his side with tears of joy and love. Like father like son. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After what seems like an eternity the celebrant steps up to recite his lines for each of them to repeat to each other, their final vows of commitment. His voice cracks with the first line and they both share a quiet and nervous laugh. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Moi, Warren Bancroft, je vous prennent Elise Desmarais pour &ecirc;tre mon &eacute;pouse,&quot; his words were pure sincerity. His back straightens in full military strength of habit and he forces himself to regain command of his voice. &quot;pour avoir et pour juger de ce jour vers l'avant, pour meilleur ou pour plus mauvais, pour plus riche, pour plus pauvre, dans la maladie et dans la sant&eacute;, &agrave; l'amour et pour aimer,&quot; he faithfully recites while his hands reach out to hold onto hers and he finds comfort that they are shaking too. &quot;De ce jour vers l'avant jusqu'&agrave; la mort nous faire partie,&quot; he finishes and listens while his bride recites her lines dutifully back to him. There is an overpowering sense of warmth coarsing through him, never had he ever felt this kind of loving commitment from another person not related to him. Soon she would be his wife.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Celebrant finally poses the most important question of his life and he finds his throat almost too tight to speak. &quot;Je le veux. Avec cet anneau je promets d'&ecirc;tre votre mari fid&egrave;le,&quot; he promises, slipping the ring over her slender finger with a smile to reassure her. The hardest part is now over for him, he can breathe knowing he didn't drop the ring - a worry that was plauging him for the entire service.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His bride responds to her own question, her voice quivering beautifully. &quot;Je le veux. Avec cet anneau je promets d'&ecirc;tre votre &eacute;pouse fid&egrave;le.&quot; As she slides the ring on his finger his hands enclose around hers and they await eagerly for the most anticipated line.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Vous pouvez embrasser la mari&eacute;e.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheers sound as the two embrace in a long and impassioned kiss but the bliss is short lived. Out of the corner of his eyes he sees them standing at the back of the audience and he knows he doesn't have long to spend with his new wife. Pulling her close to his chest he tries to ignore the apprehension welling up in his throat as his eyes glance across the grounds to the uniformed officers now making their way toward him. He whispers into her ear to wait for him and with great reluctance lets her go. The walk to meet the officers is only a few meters but they seem like they take an eternity to cross; he already knows what they are going to say.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They speak and he listens. They apologize and he tells them it's alright when none of it is. They excuse themselves and he watches as his life becomes a small tunnel with no light at the end of it. Soon Elise is by his side asking the question he doesn't want to answer. Yes, he says to her with painful longing in his eyes, by morning I will be gone. Brother's eyes meet and share a silent conversation, Jaques - like himself - is dressed in his full formal uniform. His mother's tears start anew, she has now realized what has happened; she has now realized both of her sons are being sent back to war. <br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>His father stands, the pillar of their family who has seen them through drought and hardship and into prosperity, and declares that for tonight there is to be nothing but vibrant celebration. Tonight they will only focus on the good in life and put off the worrying over the bad. Tonight they will laugh and share memories as a family before they must part by morning's first light. Tonight he will take his wife to their marriage bed and ignore all else. Tonight he will live because tomorrow he might die.</lj-cut><br />"

"event","Not finished, but I&nbsp;thought I'd post what I have. It's Warren and Ira getting to know each other a little better, and god does he suck at this. Enjoy.&nbsp; It's 3,019 words written today. I'm sort of proud.<br /><br />Edit: Added Warren's response. Le Fin. <br /><br /><lj-cut><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dinner was the last thing he would have expected to find himself doing, but Ira had made it more than clear that her skills did not lay in the kitchen and he had found it wise not to question her. Currently she sat supervising him on the counter while he cut the onions for the soup. It had been a few weeks since he had finally retrieved his belongings and officially moved in, but he still had not quite figured out what his actual role was. Tonight it was chef, yesterday it was handyman. Most of the pack still refused to pay this newcomer any respect until he earned it. At the very least they did respect Ira and she at least pretended to answer to him. Everyone knew better and Warren was getting sick of the act.<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Her nose crinkled. &quot;What are you making?&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Onion soup,&quot; Warren offered.<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;<i>French</i> Onion Soup?&quot; Ira asked conversationally, her legs swinging freely off the counter. Warren tried not to look at them.<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;It is soup and I am French,&quot; Warren grumbled a moment before relaxing a little as he thought it over. &quot;So yes, French onion soup.&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;My favorite,&quot; Ira added, although Warren wasn't really listening. Her smile widened a little. &quot;Say something in French.&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Un peu,&quot; Warren said sardonically.<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;What does that mean?&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I said 'something'.&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ira reached out from her perch on the counter and gave her leader a good smack upside the head. &quot;You're impossible,&quot; she complained. Was it asking too much of him to smile and be sociable once in a while? A part of her secretly still wished it had been Warren who lay dead after that fight than Jonathan. She could not and would not let that show.<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Warren looked stricken. &quot;You 'it me.&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You deserved it. I'll do it again too,&quot; she threatened with a sickly sweet voice. He believed her.<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Female dog,&quot; he muttered, going back to cutting the celery now with an increased vigor.<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ira laughed. &quot;What? I think you meant to say bitch.&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Warren paused from his cutting to think about it. &quot;Is that not what it means?&quot; Seemed reasonable to use them interchangeably. <br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Well, technically yes,&quot; it was Ira's turn to think it over, &quot;but that's not how it's used when you want to be insulting.&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Fine. You are a bitch,&quot; he corrected himself.<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ira laughed again. It was certainly not the response he'd been expecting and his scowl deepened considerably.<span> &quot;What is it this time?&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Nothing,&quot; Ira tried to get her giggles under control. &quot;I've just lost all ability to take you seriously right now.&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Warren dumped the ingredients unceremoniously into the simmering base of the soup. &quot;And it seems like you are not the only one around here who feels the same way.&quot; Warren was conflicted, while he did not truly want to be their leader at the same time he found himself expecting their respect. He should have realized the underlying issue was that they knew he didn't want to be there and were reluctant to give him any respect for it.<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;They would if they knew anything about you,&quot; Ira spoke into his thoughts. She seemed genuinely interested in helping him. She had even stood up for him on a few issues already. It was unfortunate that she had to touch on the one subject Warren had no interest in talking about. <br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;They know what they need to know,&quot; Warren answered obstinately. <br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;They know that you killed Johnathan as an outsider. They know you never served in a pack before. They know you're a foreigner. They know you haven't done much of anything to earn their respect, and they know you don't even want to be here with them.&quot; Ira had obviously given this a great deal of thought, Warren noted irritably. It was even more irritating that she was right.<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I do not think a history lesson will do any good.&quot; Quite suddenly the soup required all of his immediate attention.<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;It would do me some good to hear it,&quot; Ira doggedly interjected. She wasn't giving up. Not yet. &quot;I don't even know where you're from. Would it help if I went first?&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Do you want dinner tonight?&quot; Warren was switching gears and the tone of his voice demanded that she do the same. &quot;Stop prying and let me work. I do not want to know where you are from or what your favorite color is or even 'ow you 'ave come to be what you are. And I certainly do not want to share those things of mine with you.&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ira slipped off the counter, no longer the casual listener she had set out to be. If looks could be coagulated into a tangible substance her's would be a highly caustic acid. Looks can't kill but she was certainly trying. &quot;You can be a real bastard. It was a mistake to ever want to get to know a selfish, self-absorbed ass like you.&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Warren watched as she stormed off, perplexed by her strong emotional response to what was, in his opinion, a fairly practical statement. What exactly had he said? Warren mentally shrugged it off, there was dinner to be made and he was sure Ira would get over it. After all, she had said this soup was her favorite so it followed naturally to assume she'd be back for dinner.<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the time the others of the pack had finished eating and Ira had yet to make an appearance, Warren started to feel guilty. He wasn't sure exactly what about his actions had been offensive but obviously he had said something he shouldn't have. Obviously Ira was more upset than he had wanted to admit to at first. Not having her at the table had been a poignant reminder to just how much influence she had in this rough assemblage of a community. If one thing was made obvious by her absence it was that he needed her, at least on some level. Warren frowned. He wasn't ready to admit to <i>that</i> quite yet. <br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was still some soup left and he prepared a bowl of it to take to her. Even if she was still upset with him she shouldn't be made to go hungry for it and perhaps he could use the soup as a peace offering. It was better than going to her empty handed. Odd, she wasn't in her room. The warehouse wasn't very big, nor was it very well organized, but Warren still didn't know all the nooks and crannies she might have gone off to for sulking pruposes. If she didn't want to be found then Warren wasn't about to make the effort to go looking. With a shrug he turned and left, heading for his own makeshift room - the very same one he had woken up in. No reason to let good soup go to waste. <br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The guilt still gnawed at him as he approached, Ira had, after all, gone back with him to finally bring what little of the belongings he owned. Belongings that were now being pwed through with absolutely no regard for privavy. He immediately forgot why he had been feeling guilty.<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Mon Dieu! What the 'ell do you think you are you doing?!&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Research,&quot; Ira answered with an irritating matter of factness to her voice. &quot;Is that for me?&quot; She asked, indicating the soup Warren held in his hand.<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Warren clutched the bowl possesively to his chest. He wasn't about to give her his fine soup after she just got finished riffling through his personal effects. &quot;Not anymore it isn't. To think I was feeling guilty about before! Stop, enough of it, you 'ave seen enough.&quot; The misbegotten soup was set aside in favor of the photos being pulled away from her snooping hands. &quot;You 'ad no right to be in 'ere.&quot; His glare fell to the black and white photograph of three men in military uniforms standing with their arms around each other's shoulders with wide and naive smiles plastered on their young faces. They had no idea of the horror they would witness, they had only thoughts of glory and bragging rights in their foolish heads. They would soon learn that the real badges you carried with you were the scars no one would ever be able to see. It was a private pain that she had no right to be witnessing in him. <br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Which war were those taken from?&quot; Ira was undaunted by his previous outburst, but her voice was low and respectful. She understood that look on his face as he surveyed the picture held in his hand.<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;The Great War,&quot; he answered, reluctantly lifting his eyes from the smiling faces. &quot;You 'ad no business looking through them.&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Then maybe you should have made it my business. I am, like it or not, your second - your <i>lieutenant</i>. If the others knew you were a war hero they would undoubtedly have more respect for your command authority.&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;War hero?&quot; Warren scoffed. &quot;There are no such things as heros in war, there are only casualties. No one ever makes it back a hero.&quot; A hand lifted to point a finger sharply at her. &quot;Do not ever think of me as one. This discussion is over and you are <i>not</i> to discuss it with the others. <i>Any</i> of it.&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I just don't get it,&quot; Ira blurted out, no longer able to keep her temper under control. Warren was being such a child about this and it was time for him to be told what was to be expected of him. &quot;You have a real chance here to gain the respect a leader deserves and you're doing nothing but hide it. You don't want them to respect you,&quot; she realized slowly then began to build momentum with the idea, &quot;because if they respect you then you'll have a greater obligation to them to be a leader. What are you so damn afraid of?&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I am warning you, do not go there.&quot; Warren's glare was almost more of a plead than a threat.<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Or what? You'll shut me out of your life? Face it Warren, we're a team and I can't keep defending you to them when I have no idea who you are. <i>They</i> have no idea who you are. If this is about your horrible experiences in the war, I'm sorry but we've all have encountered our own horrors. We face them as a pack, that's what families do.&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;There are some things you just do not deal with as a group. It is <i>personal</i>.&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Oh grow the hell up. You are not the only one to have hardship in your life, Warren Bancroft. Julian's father was hunted down right in front of him and his mother when he tried to protect them. Johnathan lost his wife and children when he went through the change for the first time, he woke up covered in their blood. Lilian's family has disowned her but not before trying to beat her to death for being what she is, what she never asked to be. Do I need to continue or have you finally gotten the point? All of us have our own stories to tell, it makes us who we are.&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;My story 'as nothing to do with any of you. It is <i>mine</i>.&quot; Warren was stubborn about not getting the point Ira was trying to make and it was beginning to fray her last nerve.<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Bullshit! You're letting your past affect <i>our</i> future and I'm not going to let that stand. I've let you sulk for the past few weeks and it's about damn time for you to man up and take some responsibility. I will not let this pack - this <i>family</i> - go to hell because of your damnable emotional constipation.&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Warren looked taken aback by her outburst, but mostly by the explicatives. Ira hardly ever swore which made it all the more impacting when she decided to. For a long moment he remained quiet, alternating his glance between her stern features and the photograph in his hand. Slowly, almost embarrassingly so, he realized that this universal truth must apply to her too. He had told her he didn't care about her past and indirectly he had been telling her he didn't care about her pain. Reaching back he grabbed the still warm soup bowl and took a few steps toward her, stretching it out like the peace offering he had intended it to be in the first place. &quot;And what about your story?&quot; He asked quietly when she finally accepted the soup.<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;It's not very different from the others.&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Warren made his way past her and sat on the bed. A hand patted the empty space beside him to indicate his desire for her to join him there. &quot;I would still like to 'ear it, if you feel comfortable telling me.&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ira seemed skeptical but she walked slowly over to where he sat all the same. A spoonfull of soup occupied her lips for a moment. &quot;You're a good chef. Something else I didn't know about you.&quot;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;</span></span><i>Il y a plus que je suis dispos&eacute; &agrave; vous montrer</i>,&quot; Warren replied, his French fluent and rolling off his tongue naturally.<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I didn't catch that,&quot; she was smiling.<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You 'ad asked me to say something to you in French earlier. I said that there is more I am willing to show you.&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;And you mean that?&quot; Her deep blue eyes were studying him intently, searching for any signs of deception or unwillingness in his features.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I would not 'ave said it otherwise.&quot; At least that part of him was true. Warren rarely, if ever, said anything that didn't need to be said or was something he had no intention of following through on. &quot;Alors, you 'ave a story to tell.&quot; <br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She couldn't possibly have argued with him over the subject of revealing personal information and then refuse to share her own, and she knew it. Luckily she didn't have as much of a problem sharing as he did. After finishing the bite of soup she was on she began. &quot;I was born a Lycan. Both my father and my mother came from a long line of them. We lived in Rome, you can't imagine the beauty of that city that people these days miss out on.&quot; Her gaze was wistful with the memories. &quot;Of course, it was nothing compared to the glory days of Rome, mind you. I'm not <i>that</i> old.&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Warren actually gave a small laugh, he even smiled - unless it was a trick of the lights or perhaps a facial twitch.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ira continued on. &quot;But Rome wasn't safe. The Order is perhaps at its strongest there, I have my theories that Rome is where they began their damnable crusade. We were so happy,&quot; her voice was a resigned sigh. &quot;We had never harmed a soul. During the full moon we would curl up at the hearth and keep to ourselves.&quot; When she noticed the frown of confusion on Warren's face she explained further. &quot;Those who are born to this life make the change during the full moon but we keep our sense of self, we control our actions.&quot; At that she paused for another long indulgence of the soup. It wasn't easy to remember the past, especially all the painful parts of it. &quot;I was so young. I didn't understand what was happening at first. I will never forget the way my mother shielded me with her body. She didn't give them the satisfaction of a scream, she just quietly fell at my feet. My father put up a fight until he saw her there. They never gave him the chance to mourn. He was dead well before he hit the ground.&quot; She paused there, finding the lump in her throat a little too hard to speak around. The warm soup had a calming affect and she took as much advantage of it as she could.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;And what 'appened to you,&quot; Warren asked, his voice a low and gentle hum.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;They took one look at me and said 'she'll starve on her own, she's just a child', and then they left. I don't know how long I stayed with their bodies. After that I learned to grow up. Rome could no longer be a home to me so I left and eventually I ended up here, to make a longer story short. Johnathan immediately saw me for what I was when we met in town, he saw that I could use a safe place to stay where I would be surrounded by those who understood me. We became close friends and he entrusted this family to me. You're a part of that family now, Warren, I just hope you can come to see that.&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At some point during her story Warren's hand had migrated slowly over to lay on top of hers, when her voice had become strained he gave her soft and slender fingers a light squeeze. He wasn't good at gestures of compassion or concern, but there were those who could bring out that long dormant side in him. Elise had been the first and now Ira. &quot;I am sorry about what I said before. I only did not want you to share your life with me because I did not want to feel obligated to do the same in return. I never meant that you were unimportant, though...I realize now that it sounded much that way.&quot; He didn't make apologies often but he felt this was a very good time to say one.<span><br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I know. I only pressed the issue because I honestly do want to get to know you, and it would be beneficial for this family to know you as well. Trust me. You don't even have to say anything too personal, just give me an idea of who you are.&quot; To Warren's slight surprise her hand had turned over to reciprocate the hold. To his greater surprise he didn't find an urge to pull away nagging at him. She had nice hands.</span></span></span></lj-cut><br /><lj-cut text=""Warren's turn."">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I was, obviously, born in France,&quot; Warren began tentatively. He wasn't sure what he was going to tell her, none of it came easy for him. Not even naming a favorite color. It all just felt far too personal and no one should know him all that well. Maybe because if they knew him they would know enough to be disappointed by him at some point. &quot;My parents were farmers, we mostly 'ad a vineyard. Every summer my feet would be a continuous stain of purple. Some times they were mistaken for being bruised. I do not know 'ow it started but our wine began to sell well, I was thinking of going to university, though I do not remember now what I would 'ave studied. The war broke out shortly after and my brother,Jaques - the one you see there in the picture on my right - and I signed up.&quot; Warren gave a rueful sort of laugh. &quot;I thought I would come back with medals and impress Elise enough into marrying me. As it turned out just seeing me in a uniform was enough, frankly I think the uniform itself gave me the courage to ask. Or maybe it was because I thought I might never come back and get the chance. We were allowed one visit after training, I spent it with 'er, three months later I received a letter from 'ome - she was pregnant and I was going to be a father.&quot; His eyes were distant but at that point he forcefully looked away. If he was going to tear up it would not be in front of Ira, or anyone else for that matter. &quot;I would never see 'im, though she named 'im Matthieu after my younger brother...he died of a fever as a child.&quot; Another pause was made, but this time his eyes settled back on the neutral position of their hands. &quot;I will not tell you what 'appened out there. Some things are better left to memories and I do not want you picturing it.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Are you protecting me?&quot; Ira's voice was soft and not confrontational at all, merely curious.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I am, and you do not get a say in the matter.&quot; Warren cleared his throat and continued on. &quot;Verdun was the worst of it. We 'ad to be rotated in shifts through the trenches outside the city. It was, as they 'ave come to call it, the longest fought battle of that war. I lost bothJaques and Maurice, that picture was taken before we were sent on rotation. It was the last time I saw either of them.&quot; A swarm of emotions battled for dominance on his face before all of them were roughly thrown aside. &quot;We thought it was going to be another adventure like the ones we would make up in the vineyards, only this time the bullets were real and there was not a call to dinner at the end of the day. It did not even matter that I lived, there was not a 'ome to go back to. There was shelling on either side, not nearly so extensive as the second war, but our farm was close to front lines. There was barely even a foundation left.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ira had a contemplative look on her face as she listened to him retell what had to be a very painful memory. It meant a great deal to her to be the one he shared it with. &quot;I'm sorry about what I said before, too,&quot; she finally settled on. &quot;You're not as much of an ass as I gave you credit for.&quot; Her thumb smoothed over the rough back of his hand. &quot;It would be hard to want another family, but there is healing in it. No one will replace the ones we've lost, but we're together and that's all that matters now.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warren pulled his hand back. &quot;I cannot be what you and your family needs. I could not protect my own family, I do not need another one. You are a very capable woman and this pack respects you. I see no reason why you should not be leading them. I would prefer if you would let me leave instead of giving me another death threat.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ira's patience could only take so much testing in one night and Warren seemed intent on trying to find all her limits. &quot;You can't run away from every chance to fail. And what if I do allow you to leave, what kind of example does that set for the rest of the pack? That they can quit just because it scares them to continue? I will <i>not</i> let this pack fall apart because of your insecurities. Running before you can fail is failure in itself. You are capable of this and I have already told you I am willing to stand at your side, what more do you need?&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warren seemed to mull it over but not to the desired effect. &quot;I never asked for this.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No one ever does, but you're here and you need to face it.&quot; They had been doing so well, she had really let herself think he was coming around and the disappointment was fraying her already tested nerves. &quot;Thanks for the soup. I think I need to call it a night. Are you going to be here by morning or do I have to sleep at your door?&quot; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had gotten up from the bed so his glare had to come from an upward angle and lost much of its force. &quot;I 'ave no where else to go.&quot; The truth of that statement wouldn't hit him with its full force until she shut the door and he was alone. He really didn't have anyone or anything else to go to. Maybe it was time to stop running and this was a good of place as any to let himself settle down into. Begrudgingly he had to admit that Ira was right yet again. His first order of business would be to trust her. It would have saved him a substantial amount of aggravation.</lj-cut><br /><br />"

"event","Vincent develops a conscience and Gabriel's secret is out. Word count so far is now at: 15597. I'm slowly catching up to where I&nbsp;need to be. Slowly.<br /><lj-cut text=""Dun dun dun?""><br />The cell phone flipped open and was lifted to his ear. &quot;We're clear here,&quot; Vincent was saying into it. &quot;Yes, they've been dispatched. Cleaners are clear to go in at their discretion.&quot; A pause while he listened to the other voice. &quot;Yes, there were juveniles present...yeah, I've dealt with them. Do you want to come up here and hold my hand while you're at it? I'm fine, Shade. It's all part of the job, remember? Just concern yourself with keeping watch. Ghost out.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The phone clicked shut and the factitious conversation was over; Vincent's work had just begun. &quot;The alley has been cleared. You've got maybe five minutes before they arrive and about three before I set up the distraction. Get out of here before then.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The family huddled together on the floor slowly began to untangle themselves. Children had to be shushed as they were pried from one another.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Why should we trust you?&quot; It was the father and guardian of the family understandably questioning him. He had every right to be cynical, Vincent expected no less.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You shouldn't, but as it stands I don't think you've got much of a choice. You can try and fight and I'll kill you in front of your family, you can stay here too long debating the issue and the cleaners will take care of it for me, or you can take the risk that I've grown bored of efficient kills and decided tonight to be more inventive and you might just get out of this with your lives.&quot; Vincent's arms lifted out slightly in a gesture he hoped would appear non-threatening. &quot;You should know that what I'm doing is treason, my neck is on the line here, not just yours. So please, whatever you're going to do, do it fast.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Why? Why do you care? You work for <i>them</i>.&quot; The mother wasn't entirely satisfied either.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What does it matter? I don't have time for a story. Take your family and go.&quot; What was penance to them when it came from their would-be executioner. His motives didn't matter, the only thing that did were the results. If he could at least save one more innocent family the horrors of his organization's will then perhaps he could start sleeping better at night.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vincent could hear the patter of feet as the family of werewolves made their cautious way out onto the fire escape and down. He didn't need a watch to know when three minutes were up - all the time he could possibly allow them. Without ceremony Vincent lit a match and dropped it to the soaked rag at his feet and began walking at a very brisk pace for the door. For good reason, the wet cloth lit up on contact behind the hunter and snaked its flaming way along the floor ending inside a jug placed by the back wall. With the countdown still going in Vincent's head he leaped when it reached 1 with a diving roll out into the stairwell. The explosion sent flames licking overhead but Vincent was already crouched low and moving down the stairs two at a time. &quot;That went well,&quot; he coughed to himself, more than a little impressed with his handiwork. That would mark the first homemade bomb he'd ever set off.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the flames must have been visible because there was already a clamor of people. A great distraction for a small family to escape with. As predicted his phone was angrily buzzing away in his pocket. Pausing against the wall of the staircase he flipped the phone open to answer it.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yeah?&quot; There was predictable yelling on the other end. &quot;I don't know! The place must have been rigged. I set it off as I going to leave. Yeah...yeah I'm fine, I'm in the stairwell coming down, I shouldn't need any assistance, just keep everyone away from the building.&quot; With that said he clicked the phone shut and tucked it away and began taking the stairs two at a time again, praying he wouldn't trip and fall. Though it would be a faster way to get down from the ninth floor.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fire was burning far better than he had anticipated. It honestly was the first time he'd set a building on fire. What the hell was he doing? The right thing? Somehow he never figured that under any condition an outright act of terrorism was 'the right thing' to do. He had a suspicion that the family now running a few blocks away would disagree with that sentiment. Vincent had expected for this to feel different somehow. The warm and cozy sensation just wasn't there and he had to wonder if it ever would be. Then again, it was easy to feel warm with the flames licking at him from all sides but not so easy to feel cozy. He'd have to save his internal debate for another time.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acrid smoke was the least of his worries as he moved further down from the roaring fire overhead. Support beams of the abandoned complex gave way around him and one swung precariously close behind him and crashed into the banister setting it in flames. Perhaps burning down an old building on top of himself had not been one of his brightest ideas to date. Hopefully it wouldn't be his last one either. Each step he hit only increased his growing anxiety when he learned he still had more to go. Just one more. Just one more. Finally he was right and no sooner had he hit the landing he was off and running for the exit, coughing wickedly as he went.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His timing could not have been any closer. Just as he felt the relief of the cold night air, the building finally gave way behind him. Vincent felt the impact lifting him into the air and the only thing to do was hope for a convenient patch of grass to land on. The only thing to welcome his fall was the unconcerned and cold cement. One thing was for certain, if he wanted to continue secretly sparing lives he needed a better cover than an apartment fire. Especially an apartment fire that took place with him still inside. He considered the lesson well learned.<br /> <div style=""text-align: left;""><br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was nearing dawn by the time Vincent crashed onto the living room couch. This time it had been a small clutch of Vampires that he had found fit to spare. It wasn't easy gathering up enough dust to convince his associates of their demise but somehow they had pulled it off. Vincent was immeasurably glad none of them had decided to have a late night snack after he was through with the deceit. Wouldn't that be the irony of it all? <span>At least Gabriel wasn't home to see him traipsing in this early in the morning, he was sure there would have been a slurry of questions if the artist hadn't been away visiting family. It was something he did once a month and this time Vincent had forgotten to wish his grandmother well in her recovery. In consolation he was sure he would hear all about it when his roommate and friend returned. Sometimes his found himself getting curious about Gabriel's outings, especially when they took place in the middle of the week, but Gabriel accepted the odd hours Vincent kept and his own odd travel plans on the very thin explanation of being a government translator. <br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The troubling part was that so very few questions were asked. In Vincent's experience the people who didn't question things that were out of the ordinary were people who lived out of the ordinary lives themselves and wouldn't enjoy questions about their lives in return. After all, wasn't that the reason he didn't pry into Gabriel's personal life because it would give him permission to pry into Vincent's? What was it, exactly, that Gabriel didn't want to be questioned about in return? What secrets might he be keeping that would make him so very understanding about Vincent wanting to keep his own? Or perhaps it was all just simple naivety. Gabriel certainly had no shortages of it.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was interrupted from his musing by a sound at the door that was unusual. A scraping sound as if someone were trying to-- Vincent was immediately on his feet in a ready stance. A hand slipped easily to the dagger still hanging at his belt and he made his way cautiously to the door. Someone was trying - with limited success - to pick the lock. Vincent wasn't about to give them enough time to finish. With a quick snap of his wrist he twisted the dead bolt lock open before grabbing and turning the door handle. The door was pulled inward along with the intruder but Vincent was ready and waiting for him.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>His right hand shot out to grab a hold of the intruder and adeptly tugged the man off balance and had his back pressed to Vincent's chest with the knife in his left hand quickly lifting to press along his neck.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Vincent! What are you--aahh!&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Vincent almost dropped the dagger at the sound of a familiar voice. &quot;Gabe? What are you doing trying to break in?&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I couldn't ha--&quot; Gabriel gasped with another whine of pain, &quot;get the key in.&quot; His motor skills after a night of being changed were decisively imprecise. <br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It wasn't until a faint smell reached Vincent's nose that he noticed what the blade - what the <i>silver</i> blade - was doing to Gabriel. Immediately he let go, horrified at the possibility, and took a halting step backward. &quot;Werewolf,&quot; he breathed out almost silently with what breath he had left after that shock. &quot;Werewolf!&quot; This time it was an accusation and the dagger rose back up to point at Gabriel.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Vincent...I can explain,&quot; Gabriel began, one hand was rubbing along the deep burn on his neck that was already beginning to heal slowly.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;That what, you have an acute allergy to silver?! That your absences just happen to coincide during the full moon?! I can't believe this. You were my <i>friend</i>.&quot; Somehow in his mind Vincent had yet to reconcile the fact that he saved select members of the underkind yet had not placed them on the same level he reserved for humanity. <br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;What exactly has changed, Vincent? I'm still me.&quot; Gabriel's voice was calm and Vincent thought it had no right to be. Not when he was so unnerved by it all.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You--&quot; quite suddenly every argument he could think of fell just shy of his lips. Gabe did make an astonishingly good point. <br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As if motivated by his lack of a response, Gabriel gained momentum. &quot;What government translator carries a silver dagger to work?&quot; The question was almost lightly curious if it wasn't for the prior confrontation. Vincent understood the point Gabriel was trying to make. <br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;So we've lied to each other,&quot; he conceded, dropping his knife hand down to rest at his side. &quot;I kill people like you for a living.&quot; <br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Silence draped heavily between them for a long moment before Gabriel broke it finally with a simple and understated question. &quot;So what now? Are we supposed to fight to the death in the living room?&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Vincent couldn't help himself. A quiet chuckle emanated from his lips before he could stop it and suddenly the tense situation got just a little bit lighter. Trust it to Gabe to be able to pull something of that magnitude off. &quot;I guess I quit. I mean, we just got that coffee table and I'm sure you did a great job with the decorating in there.&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Can you just quit a job like that?&quot; Gabriel had no idea the intricacies that were involved in an organization as secret dependent as the Order was.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;No, it's not that simple. Though, I haven't exactly been doing my job lately...I'm not even sure what my job really was anymore. I really can't imagine protecting society from you, no offense.&quot; Unless the danger came from an over abundance of clay pots and cups.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;None taken. Actually I'm a little flattered...I think.&quot; Gabriel didn't sound all that flattered, there was something else in his voice; something almost like uncertainty. He knew all too well the kind of horrors he was capable of, even if he hadn't had an incident in a very long time. The threat would always be there.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Where have you really been going every month,&quot; Vincent suddenly interjected as a though struck him.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;If you promise not to hunt me down,&quot; Gabriel began with a smile on his voice. &quot;I have an abandoned bank vault to go to. Why?&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If Einstein's world had been shaken by the discovery that the atom could be split even after his own professions that it was an impossibility, then Vincent's world was nearly rocked in two at the revelation that a werewolf could have the wherewithal and presence of mind to lock himself up for the protection of others. It just didn't happen. It couldn't happen. And yet standing right before him was a man who broke all conceptions he had of their kind and what they were, and more importantly were not, capable of. If Gabriel could break this rule then how many others like him out there had been ruthlessly slain without question. How many of them had he been directly responsible for. Vincent must have looked as shocked as he felt because Gabriel was in the middle of repeating his name.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;-cent. Vincent? Hey, welcome back.&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I'm sorry. I think I need some time alone to think.&quot; With that he left Gabriel in the entry way and headed for his room. There was a great deal he needed to think about and not a whole lot of time to do it in. He had a mission coming up and the killings needed to stop.</span></lj-cut></div><div style=""text-align: left;""><span> </span></div><br /><br />"

"event","I'm going by snipets at a time as I finish them. It's just easier this way since I've been skipping around some and making chapters at this point is fairly ridiculous with all the disorder. Maybe if I come back to edit I'll rearrange my thoughts better but for now I just need to get the words down. Without further ado, I present Charlotte and her nightclub Arcadia (AHAHA I&nbsp;remembered the name this time, Denise). <br /><br />T<lj-cut text=""Round of drinks on the house, anyone?"">he glass clinked on the polished wooden surface of the bar and indicated its state of emptiness to the tender standing just beyond. She was a fairly tall woman with vibrantly red hair spilling in waves around her shoulders. Whether that hair was magically altered or not was any-one's guess but they didn't dare utter a word of it to her. Not if they were attached to the particular arrangement of their facial features. Most of her patrons were not what the Commons would consider normal, not by a long shot. There were vampires sipping at blood-wine at the end of the bar, keeping their distance from the neon lights of Arcadia; a few werewolves were heatedly debating politics at another table, both were intermittently picking at a nearly raw steak;&nbsp; a demi-Celestine couple tried to keep their glowing radiance to themselves as they flirted incessantly; and most peculiar of all a snowy haired hunter sat directly on the bar stool closest to the door. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charlotte had rules in her establishment and they were simple: no violence. One would not expect a multitude of underkind to get along with each other but then they had never met Charlotte. She had guesses as to the nature of her ancestry but no clear evidence. What <i>was</i> clear was that somewhere in her lineage was a very powerful fallen celestial. She was one of the Fey Children, the offspring of a mixed heritage of fallen celestials when they had roamed this planet in eons past. Like her Fey brothers and sisters she was a patchwork of characteristics, unlike the children of Shumashael, Yavechel and even Manakel. What kept the masses in good spirits despite the alcohol was her uncanny ability to turn a full grown werewolf into a blubbering schoolgirl in the space of a wicked glance. Her mental abilities seemed only to be limited by her infamously devious imagination. <br />&nbsp; Those who stayed on her good side only saw a very generous and open spirited woman willing to talk out your troubles over a glass of strong malt ale or pint of O negative Merlot. The Hunter at the bar had felt, rather than seen, both her good side and her bad. He had learned quickly that the patrons of her bar were not to be touched and that Charlotte was an invaluable source of information. They had struck a tenuous deal that she would keep his identity to herself so long as he left his work at the door. She was no fan of the Order, but Vincent wasn't your typical agent and the two of them had, over time, come to an understanding. <br />  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Another rough night,&quot; Charlotte asked, refilling Vincent's glass with brandy.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Night, week, month...&quot; Vincent murmured. &quot;It's ironic, isn't it? To be blind in more ways than one.&quot; He seemed to hear the glass being set down and reached for it instantly. The burn of alcohol helped somehow.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No one's perfect, especially not you. I'm not sure what you expected out of the Order,&quot; she went on, not even bothering to keep her voice down. Everyone in the vicinity could hear their words but Charlotte made sure that they couldn't comprehend them and didn't get an unhealthy dose of curiosity out of it either. &quot;I can tell you what I <i>think</i> you expected. I think you expected them to be honest about the world being black and white.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Thanks, that helps a lot. Throw in some 'grey area' and I'll really know what you're talking about.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charlotte's lips curved into a mischievous smile. &quot;I could always show you.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vincent physically shuddered. &quot;Don't ever do that again.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You know what I meant and I know you do. Behave and I won't torment you with pink again.&quot; It was a very good threat to make, Vincent immediately found himself less inclined to be sarcastic.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You're right. I expected the truth to be simple.&quot; A laugh cut off the rest of his thoughts. A derisive sort of laugh you made when the subject really wasn't amusing at all. &quot;I'm an idiot. The truth is rarely simple. I should have <i>known</i> that. How can I be so...&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Blind?&quot; Charlotte filled in with an amused twist of her lips.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You're hilarious,&quot; Vincent grumbled before his lips were otherwise occupied with drinking. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You were thinking it,&quot; Charlotte verbally shrugged it off.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I thought we agreed that you would stay out of my mind,&quot; Vincent said. He didn't sound enthused at all.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Liquor always loosens up thoughts. I don't have to project, you're doing it for me. So <i>technically</i> I'm not reading your mind at all.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But you are pouring the liquor,&quot; Vincent pointed out.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Want me to stop?&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No,&quot; he sighed, &quot;no I don't.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That's too bad, you've already had enough.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The hell I have. I'm not even slurring,&quot; Vincent argued, decisively less in tune with himself than Charlotte but no less confident.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Actually, you are. I got tired of trying to decipher it so I gave you a little help in that department. Honestly, you were horrendous.&quot; With Vincent's cup running dry once more she took it from him, but this time she didn't fill it back up.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Uh-huh...Next time, just let me know I've had enough instead of feeding me more.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That doesn't pay the bills, love. Speaking of, I'll put this on your tab for tonight.&quot; Vincent gave a grunt of approval and she propped&nbsp; her elbows up on the bar with both hands supporting her chin. &quot;If you want my advice you'll do the right thing from here on out. Now that you know the truth you can't let it sit.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And what exactly is the truth? That the underkind are just as capable of being virtuous as humanity? I don't believe that. Maybe...maybe they aren't as wholly malicious as I've been taught but...&quot; he paused with a quizzical look on his face, &quot;you're really going to town with supplementing my vocabulary, aren't you?&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charlotte smiled. &quot;Want to hear what you really sound like right now?&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No...I don't think I do.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Go home, get some rest, and think about it. I'm sure you'll realize just how far off base you are. You're on the right track, love, you just haven't opened your eyes enough. Say <i>anything</i> and I'll make you think you're a kitten for the rest of the night,&quot; she tacked on as a warning toward Vincent's penchant for sarcasm.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vincent gave an understanding smile. &quot;You know me so well.&quot;</lj-cut><br />"

"event","Ilya's bit. Lots of fun made up Russian words and names, bear with me. Or bare with me, if you are so inclined. Happy naked fun time. Anyway, I hope I captured at least some of Ilya's badassery with this. More to come, of course, but here's the start. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Embassy"">Chapter 3<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharp fangs receded back up into his gums, leaving just the tips to give the appearance of normal canines. As always, his chin didn't show a hint of crimson. He was, after all, a very dignified man and conducted eating in the same way he conducted everything else in his life; neatly, cleanly, and efficiently.&nbsp; That was as to be expected from the Praotet of the Petrov House. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Satisfied?&quot; a feminine voice asked as she drew away from him.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Quite. You are well bred, pass on my approval. I will see to it that an arrangement can be made between your family and this House.&quot; His tone indicated that their business was concluded and Ilya had to be impressed that she took the cue so well and left. A fine breed indeed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun had just recently set and Ilya Petrov was already at work managing the supply of Krovpostavshik -- humans that were bred for the purpose of being fed upon in return for lavish lifestyles provided by the Petrov House and her assets. Only the finest were chosen to be incorporated into the House and Ilya had full discretion over every detail. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The late Autumn Russian air was beyond chilly but it would be of no consequence to the Shumashaen as he made his way from the main mansion and into the city. Moscow was always more beautiful to look on at night, he had always thought. She had changed over the years, growing more and more modern as the encroaching influences of the West had their way with his homeland. Ilya couldn't say that he minded it so much. Indoor plumbing was a marvel, even if he hadn't a need for it; his Krovpastav did. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was business to be attended to tonight and he would be lying if he said he was looking forward to any of it. Peace treaties were always delicate things, but at least tonight he was on the moderating side of the issue. No one would challenge House Petrov, not if they valued their station in life. It meant he had unlimited security but it also meant many others of the lesser Houses vied for his protection or for his mediation in their affairs. Most were denied. Ilya Petrov had precious little time to sit down and sort out the pathetic squabbles of the lower Houses. The reason -the <i>only</i> reason - that he had agreed to this was because of blood ties to the House in question. A genealogist would quite likely tear themselves bald trying to follow the 'family' lines and lineages of the vampires but Ilya was well versed in the cryptic language of blood relation. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vampires did not have offspring in the human sense of the word. The ones they turned - which those under the Petrov House followed a strict guideline regarding siring - carried with them a signature mark that was easily detected by others. It was very rewarding to know that every member of your House bore your mark and were under your complete control. With a single uttered command he could call his entire House to his side and they would fight with every last ounce of stolen energy they had without questioning. It took little out of the imagination to see why he was perhaps the most respected and feared of the Praotets. At least in Russia. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Praotet Petrov,&quot; he was greeted with the proper respect as he entered the run down building from the side alleyway. To the outsider it would look like nothing more than an old and abandoned warehouse building in the still developing industrial district. That was exactly what they wanted the commonplace members of society to see. What they didn't want them to see was the lavish interior. Decorated in fineries, this was the location known to those in their circles as an Embassy. After the blood wars of the early centuries it was agreed upon by their kind that for the sake of their survival a place could be created in every major city that they walked that was a safe zone barred from all conflict and violence. Their kind were often depicted as savage blood thirsty beasts but Ilya knew better and had to say that humanity was not much different; no matter how hard they tried to be. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I assume that I am the first one here?&quot; he asked. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You are. I have been told to make you comfortable while you wait. I'm sure their delay is merely caused by the inconvenience in distance and not by...regrettable disagreements.&quot; In other words, Ilya translated to himself, the pair of conflicted lesser Praotets had not taken matters into their own violent hands. Yet.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Noted. I can make myself comfortable. Notify me once they arrive and are in a civil enough mood or do not notify me at all.&quot; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Embassy had a sweeping staircase that lead to the second floor and was decorated like the rest of the interior with shimmering golds and vibrant reds. Serving as a safe-haven was not the only purpose of the Embassy, it was also a library and on occasion even a hotel to visiting dignitaries and those seeking shelter from the threat of harm.In rare events it had even served as a hospital of sorts. Contrary to popular fiction, vampires could feel pain and were not immune to injury even if they were infinitely more durable than their human counterparts. Of course no medical student would even know what to do with a vampire patient, but the Embassy's trained apothecaries could work wonders with their herbal concoctions. It was more of an art than a science, in Ilya's opinion, but he had made use of them often enough to know that they were indeed skilled at what they did whether or not it was an exact science.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ilya had found himself a comfortable spot in the grand study of the Embassy on the second floor. A historian would have a field day if he ever found himself in the confines of this library. Ancient tomes and scrolls line the walls along with more modern texts and many, if not most, of them were historical accounts of the world told through the ever observant eyes of the Shumashaens. There was not a more accurate collection of human and underkind history than the libraries the Shumashaens kept. They were the stoic and fairly unbiased observers of the world and they were practically obsessed with keeping meticulous records.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All records agreed that their kind, and those of their cousins, had a common celestial source. Most religions would agree that they were the regrettable spawn of fallen angels; the spawn of demons. Ilya, and his kindred, knew much better. They were the offspring of the first free-thinkers this world had ever produced; yet humanity would forever remain ignorant of it. The Order saw to that religiously. Luckily for Ilya his great mentor, Grigory Petrov, had ensured that he learned who he was and where he came from. Shumashael had been a great warrior and a trusted friend, as history told of him, willing to forgo his birthright to sit at the Table of Elders in order to enlighten mankind under the rebellion of Lucifer's design. He had created the sun in his early days as a Celestial and his genius was rewarded by the placement of his creation at the center of their system. But no amount of accomplishment could ever make up for his later treason, the least it could do was grant him reprieve from Hell but banishment from Heaven. The Great Battle had left him near death but the Elders would not be satisfied. Added to his list of punishments would be the thirst and hunger for life that could never and would never be quenched. His own creation was turned against him and the rays he had sculpted now bit and tore at his flesh. From him all Vampires were born and to him all pay respect while they suffer the same afflictions. Those who remain religiously tied to their creator called themselves the Shumashaens and the rest were content to be known as the world perceived them as Vampires. <br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reading these tomes always brought about a certain nostalgia that this Praotet was not entirely comfortable with. Ilya was spared from his memories by the arrival of the Ambassador who presided over this Embassy.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Praotet Petrov,&quot; his greeting was simple and to the point. Ilya appreciated that.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Ambassador,&quot; he greeted in kind. &quot;I pressume our guests have arrived without incident.&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I would not go that far,&quot; the Ambassador said. A ghost of a smile touched his lips.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Wonderful,&quot; Ilya replied without much enthusiasm. &quot;Then let's get started while they are still practiced at pretending to be civil.&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Agreed. This way,&quot; the Ambassador invited with one hand outstretched.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The conference room was much like the rest of the Embassy in terms of style and decor. A little too flashy in Ilya's opinion but it did a very good job of commanding respect; something Ilya could appreciate. Both disgruntled parties were sitting at the end of the long rectangular table on either side of it and were busy in the endeavor of glaring each other to death. The spot at the head of the table was reserved for the leading House's Praotet and Ilya gracefully alighted the ornate chair as if it, and everything else in the room, belonged to him.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Now,&quot; Ilya began, his hands folding together to rest on top of the wooden table, &quot;before we begin I have a few points of interest to make. There will only be <i>one</i> of you speaking at a time and only when I give you the direction to. I trust I am making myself clear.&quot; His slate grey eyes glanced about the sour faces to either side of him to be sure they were listening. When he was satisfied that they were he continued on. &quot;Praotet Dimechev, you first.&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Praotet Maikov is a liar and a blood traitor. I want back what is rightfully mine. He is doing business with the Yavechaens. Our enemies.&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;He lies! He always lies,&quot; Maikov spat across the table.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Enough, Dmitry,&quot; Ilya commanded, his voice an icy smooth glacier between the pair. &quot;You will get your turn to speak, I promise. Unless you would like for me to make my final ruling right now.&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;No,&quot; Dmitry conceded weakly, &quot;I do not.&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Then keep quiet until I direct you to speak or you will not get a chance to at all. Praotet Dimechev, continue.&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was agonizing to sit through the petty bickering of the two men who shouldn't even be calling themselves Praotets. For a while Ilya toyed with the idea of simply absorbing both Houses into his own, but these two were the best both Houses had to offer then they wouldn't be worth the trouble. Another recurring thought was more appealing but decisively illegal within the shelter of the Embassy's walls. Pity. When all had finally been said and both men seemed winded from spouting off their own pithy arguments, Ilya rose from his chair to command all attention in the room.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You are both contemptibly pathetic,&quot; Ilya all but spat. &quot;When was the last time either of you picked up a tome or heard a retelling of our past?&quot; The lack of a response disheartened him even more. He could almost see Grigory's disdainful frown pulling at the ghost of his mentor's lips. He would give these two a speech that would make even Grisha proud. &quot;I see.&quot; Ilya directed his piercing glare toward the man on his right. &quot;Dimechev, you are a fool and worse than that you are ignorant of it. The Yavechaens are our cousins, not our enemies. You are confusing yourself with their other sect, the Werewolves. Educate yourself on the difference before you open that mouth of yours.&quot; His glare snapped over to the other side of the table. &quot;Quit that ridiculous smirking, Maikov, you are no better. You are dealing with the Wolves and not the Yavechaens. I suggest you acquaint yourself with the distinction as well.&quot; Ilya took a breath to repress the urge to mentally annihilate them both. &quot;Praotet Maikov, you will repay Praotet Dimechev what he is owed and then you will <i>both</i> do a little research. Because if I find that you have made this same mistake again I will not be inclined to settle your differences for you. Dismissed.&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On his way out of the Embassy, Ilya gave pause to consider visiting one of the resident apothecaries for something strong to cure the headache the two had caused him. Pride, and a dash of impatience to get out of there, kept him walking toward the manor. Like the Embassy, the Petrov Manor looked like nothing more than an abandon smelting factory from the outset, but Ilya could see what was just beneath the surface of that image. Spindling towers rose where smokestacks could be seen, decorated in the Gothic style in which it was first constructed. He had seen no reason to change it when he had taken over as Praotet. The gargoyle structures had character and history, even if they were just a bit too stereotypical for his tastes. His other manor in New York City was much more modern and more styled to his tastes. Perhaps it was about time to head back to his other interests across the globe. Another reason why he was a Praotet to be feared; Ilya's House was a global force. <br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Maybe it was time to visit his American chapter and ensure that everything was running as smoothly as if his hands were conducting it directly. And besides all of that, he really did miss the pizza.</lj-cut><br /><br />It amuses me to no end to think about Ilya enjoying a big slice of NY style pizza. I&nbsp;have no idea why. The vampires in this 'verse can eat normal food with no consequence, either in nutrition or adverse affect. They do it purely for the physical enjoyment of taste and nothing more. They tend to be very pleasure-seeking, a good deal of their rituals - even feeding - revolve around it.<br />"

"event","More writing nonsense, this time mainly between&nbsp;Dean and Vincent. Attempting to explore Vincent's reservations that are beginning to form and will be brought to full force later. Gabe gets a mention and will actually make more of an appearance in the next bit. I'm absurdly nervous about writing him for some reason. <br /><br />Note: Gabe is Vincent's roommate because I figured it was easier that way. This by no means requires you to think of him that way outside of this incarnation. But I&nbsp;figured you already knew that. Worth mentioning, at least.<br /><br />Edit: Added the rest of it. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Confrontation"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life never stopped just because you wanted it to; or even because you desperately needed it to. Time was indifferent to a man's struggle and duty never took a vacation. There was an option to give in to the temptation of isolation or the immersion into work. Vincent chose the latter while Marcus chose the former. It seemed predictable that the rookie wouldn't handle a kill like that well at all. Vincent wasn't faring much better but he had the experience to not let any of it show.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a dangerous game for an organization so dedicated to one ideal to have within its midsts a rogue thought. A stray infection of ethics could be disastrously fatal if it was allowed to spread. Dean recognized this crucial fact better than most. It was what brought him to Vincent's apartment that night.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door opened to a young man he'd never seen before with unruly, blond, wavy locks of hair nearly to his shoulders. The long sleeves of his shirt were rolled up and what looked like mud was stained in splotches over the front of his jeans. Both hands were holding a towel and were taking turns at wiping each other off.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Can I help you?&quot; he asked politely to Dean.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm here for Vincent,&quot; Dean replied without the same tone of friendliness in his voice.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Just a moment, I'll get him for you.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blond turned and walked down the small hallway. &quot;Come on in,&quot; he invited. &quot;Hey, Vincent? There's someone here to see you.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Tell them I'm sorry I can't return the favor,&quot; Dean heard Vincent's reply from where he was standing in the hall.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You never get tired of those comments, do you?&quot; The blond was admonishing halfheartedly.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And I doubt he ever will,&quot; Dean was saying as he invited himself both into the room and conversation. &quot;Vincent, tell your friend here to take a little walk. Maybe run some errands. We need to speak.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blond looked rather nonplussed at his casual dismissal, though he did flick a curious glance between the pair. &quot;It's alright, I have some projects to take to the kiln. I should be gone for a couple of hours, is that enough for you or should I paint you something while I'm at it?&quot; The question carried a distinctive not of sarcasm beneath the friendly veneer and Vincent must have picked up on it because all he did was smile faintly to himself.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dean wasn't amused at all. &quot;Leave.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'll make it up to you,&quot; Vincent was promising, &quot;I'll have dinner on by the time you get back.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'll hold you to it. Now that we've labeled everything in the kitchen in braille, I expect I'll actually be able to eat it this time.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Quaint,&quot; Dean expressed his opinion of their exchange by closing the bedroom door with the blond standing outside of it.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Was there something you needed that a phone call couldn't have handled?&quot; Vincent asked once they were alone.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Would I make the effort otherwise? You've not spoken to Marcus recently, I take it.&quot; Deans eyes briefly glanced about the spartan room, he'd never been in Vincent's apartment but somehow the stark blandness of it suited the blind hunter.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Not recently, no. He asked for time off, I'm not going to pry.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I have,&quot; Dean continued on as if Vincent had never spoken. &quot;He tells me you had a juvenile to deal with. Why was I not informed?&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He watched as the snowy white of Vincent's cheeks reddened slightly and he made the educated assumption that it wasn't embarrassment that drove the coloration. Vincent still had much to learn about concealing his emotions.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I didn't think it was necessary to trouble you with it.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vincent was lying, the only thing that eluded Dean was the why. Personal pride would be harmless, personal moral objection would be an entirely different matter. It was his mission tonight to find out which side Vincent belonged to and deal with it accordingly. Marcus had already been dealt with; an injured pride was not an easy thing to nurse but it was relatively harmless to the cause. &quot;It's police, Vincent,&quot; Dean reminded him.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I know. I also know every agent gets grilled and sent through the psych department for it. I've been busy, I'm sorry I didn't feel like penciling in a therapy session followed by a game of twenty questions. I'm guessing you're not here to ask me how I'm sleeping at night.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I always knew your mouth would need to be fixed,&quot; Dean muttered.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well, you know how I feel about dentists.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I need you to tell me exactly what transpired,&quot; Dean went on. He had learned the long ago that the best way to deal with Vincent was to ignore his sarcasm. They had brought Vincent up in the Order after he was found as an orphan. If it was up to him he would have gotten rid of the problematic hunter long ago. Sadly it was, in fact, not up to him.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's all in the report, of course Marcus typed it up so you'll need to take it up with him if it's not to your liking.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I have, and now I'm here taking it up with you. I know it's confusing but do try and keep up. Now, start at the beginning and don't leave anything out this time.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dean had to smile at the frown pulling at Vincent's lips, but he was more concerned about his demeanor.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What are you really here for, Dean? What is it you want to hear? That I've never heard a child crying for her father? Well, I have. The only difference is I've never killed a child's father right in front of them before. Let's not forget to mention listening to her die afterward. Marcus missed her heart,&quot; Vincent went on, his voice almost casual despite the grim topic. He was trying to keep it together and appear unphased by the events. &quot;The dose of silver was plenty for her body, but it wasn't quick. I held my <i>hand</i>,&quot; Vincent's voice broke finally, &quot;over her <i>mouth</i> so she couldn't even scream. So you had better not be here to tell me I'm not allowed to feel some kind of remorse.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had been hoping Vincent was simply struggling with a wounded pride that he had felt something after that event. Clearly there was more to it than that. This would have to be dealt with carefully. The Order couldn't afford for one of its own to suffer a sudden fit of moral objection during a crisis situation.&quot;You disposed of a monster, nothing more.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;She was a <i>child</i>!&quot; Vincent was on his feet now and even though his eyes were not fixed on Dean they still held a barely contained fire. &quot;You can tell me it's my job, you can eve tell me it's for mankind's protection and survival; but you <i>cannot</i> tell me how I'm supposed to feel about it! I don't care what she was, beast or human, she was a <i>child!</i>&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Vincent, please, you're embarrassing yourself.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Oh I plan to do much more than that.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Is that a threat?&quot; Dean sounded far more amused with the idea than concerned.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's a warning.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dean laughed. &quot;And what do you intend to do, Vincent, quit? I'm sure we'll get along fine without you. You're one man,&quot; he drawled out, rather satisfied with himself, &quot;you might want to think about what you would be getting yourself into before you get all self righteous on me. I know we don't see eye to eye--&quot; Vincent snorted an interruption, &quot;we don't always agree,&quot; Dean continued on, his voice a bit strained, &quot;but I know you, Vincent. I know you have a deep sense of justice and I know once this passes you'll understand that this is all for the greater good.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I doubt that.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dean smiled. &quot;That was your first child, but I can guarantee you it won't be your last. Who knows, you may even begin to enjoy it.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blow came so fast that Dean was more impressed with Vincent's skills than angry that his subordinate had just landed a left hook against his jaw.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Get out!&quot; Vincent was yelling. &quot;Get out! Get out or so help me...I'll kill you.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dean lifted a hand to massage at his jaw, smiling to himself. &quot;It will get better. You just needed to get that out of your system.&quot; With that said he left Vincent to stew over what had just transpired. The answer left him dissatisfied with the prodigy hunter. Sad; Vincent had such promise. On the way out he passed the clay spattered blond and he had to smile cryptically his way. It was time to pay Marcus another visit. Vincent needed a leash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It never really did seem to matter. He could pretend that it did, he could even believe it for a while, but in the end, when it came down to it, it never mattered. The Underkind were the Underkind and he had a sworn duty to protect humanity from their dark and tortured souls. Still, Vincent couldn't comprehend how killing children had anything to do with it all. It was what that child would grow into, he mused, that gave his organization the fear that drove them to kill, what were in Vincent's mind, innocents. It didn't make any of this any easier and he imagined it never would. Despite the lectures, despite the hours on end of horror stories of what these beasts were capable of, and despite his personal experience with their terrifying strength, Vincent could still not ascribe to the belief that they should be slaughtered before proven guilty. Of course, it was a fact that none of these beasts could live a normal life, they were by nature violent and aggressive and that could not change no matter how hard any of them willed it. Vincent knew that. He also knew that having these thoughts were dangerous and by the tone his superior had with him tonight he was in trouble. What kind of trouble was anyone's guess.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It wouldn't do to have Gabriel come home to no supper, so he pushed the nagging thoughts out of his mind for the meantime and made his way to the kitchen with one hand along the wall to guide him. Before he could get started on even selecting what to make the door opened and he could hear Gabriel down the hall sound out a notice of his arrival. So much for having dinner ready, but more importantly Vincent was concerned with how he might look. Gabriel only knew that he worked as a translator for the government and that was all he could ever know about him. Being in this vulnerable state was not wholly conducive to keeping it that way.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I don't smell dinner cooking, Vincent,&quot; Gabe was admonishing lightly as he made his way into the kitchen.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I was just about to start when you came in. Have a preference or do I have to choose what we're having?&quot; His voice was light and unconcerned, years of practice made him adept at lying. Whether that was something he should be proud of or not was a topic of thought he didn't want to face right now.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Pasta. Three cheese stuffed shelled pasta with marinated and roasted chicken, baby peas and a twice baked mashed potato on the side.&quot; Vincent couldn't see Gabriel's face but he heard the smile in his voice.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Ha ha, very funny. Mac'n cheese it is.&quot; He reached for the cupboard above and felt along the label to ensure it was the right one.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You're a horrible man, I hope you know,&quot; Gabriel chided harmlessly.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vincent cringed before he could stop himself. &quot;I know.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Whoa, wait. That sounded a little too heavy. What's going on?&quot; Abruptly there was a hand on Vincent's shoulder. Trust Gabriel to know when something was off, though right now Vincent was cursing the ability.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You're reading too into it,&quot; Vincent replied. He was making light of it with varying degrees of success. All that was required was for Gabriel to buy into it.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Am I?&quot; Gabriel didn't sound all that convinced.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You are. Now, if you don't want Mac'n'cheese you should stop the interrogation. I can handle pasta.&quot; The debate was over. He might have let himself slip but he knew Gabe well enough to know that he wouldn't press any further.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;This has to be some kind of extortion,&quot; Gabe complained before releasing his grip on Vincent's shoulder. &quot;Alright, you win. I really am not in the mood for processed cheese tonight.&quot;</span></lj-cut>"

"event","It's not finished but I thought I&nbsp;might as well post what I got for tonight. I'm up to 7,048 words when I&nbsp;needed to be at 11k by Friday. I've got some catch up to do but considering I&nbsp;started today with 4k I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;can play this catch up game.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Part of chapter 2"">Chapter 2<br />     <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hangovers were one thing, this was something completely different. Warren barely knew who he was when consciousness finally came to call on him. With a wide blink he looked up at the rusted ceiling. It appeared he was in a warehouse of some kind. Sitting up, his hands ran across the over sized flannel shirt that had been put on him; if he remembered correctly the last time he was conscious he was also undressed. The memories came flooding back at a dizzying pace and it struck him odd that he was waking up at all. If someone had killed his commanding officer he wouldn't have taken the sorry bastard in.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There's tea brewing if you're interested.&quot; Her voice was curt and to the point, not at all one he'd expect from a nurse and for good reason; she wasn't one. Her lips were pursed and both hands were on her slender hips as she glared daggers at him from across the makeshift room. &quot;Get up and get dressed, you have a pack to maintain.&quot;<br />     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I do not get to 'ave some privacy?&quot; Warren asked. A brow lifted to punctuate the question.<br />     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I've already seen you naked, remember?&quot;<br />     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warren flinched.<br />     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I remember.&quot;<br />     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Good, because I have no intention of letting you forget.&quot;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he got to his feet from the bed he noticed pants weren't part of the attire he'd been dressed in for the meantime. It was by some miracle that the flannel shirt went down enough to cover him. &quot;Fine, but do I get to at least know who is '<span suggestions=""eliding,eluding,Aldin,Eldin,olden"" class=""misspell"">olding</span> the whip?&quot;<br />     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;My name is Ira,&quot; was her curt response. She was obviously ignoring the whip comment.<br />     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Alright, Ira, I am--&quot;<br />     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Warren Bancroft, I know.&quot;<br />     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Startled, his brows furrowed as if to ask how she already knew that before a hand snatched up at his neck.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Where are they?&quot; Warren barked. Despite his state of dishevelment and undress he still kept an air of command and dignity about him.<br />     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;On the table. Get dressed, we have some work to do.&quot;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Wait just a minute,&quot; his hand lifted to stop her from grabbing up his tattered clothing. &quot;I do not 'ave anything to do except get out of 'ere and go home. I am sorry about, <span suggestions=""EU,Eu,eh,uh,Eur"" class=""misspell"">euh</span>...&quot;<br />     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Jonathan,&quot; Ira snapped, grabbing up his clothing and tossing it at his face.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warren caught the clothing and held it at his chest. &quot;Jonathan, but I 'ad nothing to do with it. He attacked me, I did nothing but defend myself. I certainly do not 'ave to do anything but apologize again and take my leave. Unless you want a shot at me.&quot;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She seemed to be contemplating it as he stepped into his torn pants. He looked ridiculous. Ira's lips twitched, they seemed to be fighting off an amused smile and losing.<br />     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What?&quot; Warren demanded, trying to look dignified in tattered jeans and an over sized flannel shirt.<br />     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No, nothing. You look wonderful.&quot;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well it is not like I 'ave all my clothing 'ere to change into. Thank you for the shirt, but whoever it belongs to is much bigger than I am.&quot;<br />     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It was Jonathan's. I'd offer you his pants too but he was much taller than you.&quot;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warren saw something flicker in her eyes and took a guess that it was remorse. It should have been her in that fight. Jonathan had left her in charge of the perimeter that evening but she had gotten caught at work. Fall was always a hectic time of year for the fashion industry but that was not an excuse. Jonathan was dead and she felt the weight and burden of his death squarely on her slender shoulders.<br />     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Warren murmured again.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You've said that already and it hasn't changed anything. Stop talking, start doing. If you are truly sorry you'll do the right thing and take his place.&quot;<br />     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I still do not understand. I killed '<span suggestions=""I'm,IMO,om,um,MI"" class=""misspell"">im</span>, 'ow am I supposed to take 'is place? And take what place? If you want any of my cooperation you will stop doing and start talking.&quot; Warren's arms folded at his chest.<br />     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You already know what we are, what <i>you</i> are. I'm sure you're not dense enough to think society accepts or acknowledges us, so we stick together. Jonathan held us together as a pack, he was our leader and our protector. Now it's your turn.&quot;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Or what?&quot; Warren asked belligerently. He still wasn't convinced he had any obligation to do anything for these people, whoever they were.<br />     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Or I kill you and take your place.&quot; She didn't seemed at all bothered by the prospect.<br />     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That is ridiculous. If I do not want the position you are welcome to take it and let me leave.&quot;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And send the message to this pack that anyone may come and go as they wish. No. I'll take the leadership the way it has been handed down for generations in packs. So you have a choice, take responsibility for your actions or face the consequences.&quot;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That is not a choice,&quot; Warren grumbled. &quot;Fine, fine. I will stay 'ere and play leader until you realize it would be better if you just let me go.&quot;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I thought you'd come around. First item on the agenda is to move you in. I'll accompany you to where you are staying now and get you situated here.&quot; Ira had the look of a woman who was used to handing out orders and keeping a system working smoothly. Warren caught himself staring quizzically at her. The problem was she caught him too. &quot;What?&quot;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I was just wondering what your job is in this pack. Where you Jonathan's....&quot; he let that trail off, a little afraid of asking it outright.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Second in command, you mean?&quot; Ira filled in for him what he'd left out with a slender ebony brow raising as if she was convinced that had not been what he was about to say.<br />     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Ah. Lead the way, then.&quot;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It felt ridiculous to walk through the city in tattered and stained clothing with a woman who looked like she belonged running a corporate office. He had to say, though, she had a good taste in clothing. Her skirt flared out at the bottom like a vase tipped upside down and the tailored suit coat and blouse completed the stern but together outfit. All that was missing was a bun on top of her head, but instead her hair was relaxed and hanging about her shoulders like wavy, velvet black curtains. And the way she walked...<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abruptly he pulled his eyes away and found other, less dangerous, things to stare at. It was a good couple of blocks worth of walking before they reached a subway terminal and if he wasn't just imagining it he would guess that Ira was enjoying his immense discomfort. He looked homeless and the people around him acted as if he was about to try and snatch up their belongings. Many of them seemed to be curiously interested at the oddity of a homeless man and a business woman together. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Which is your stop,&quot; she was asking him.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'll let you know.&quot; His reply was gruff and to the point but it seemed to suffice for her almost as if she was gracefully sliding into her role as second in command already. Even if Ira had a strong personality, to put it lightly, he still found himself impressed by her willingness to change over to his command. Were they to change places he would not be so easily swayed over. In fact, he was sure he would kill anyone who harmed his commanding officer, not submit himself to their new leadership. Evidently he had much to learn about lycan pack mentality. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car jostled its way under the channel and into Manhattan. The pair of them rode in silence along the way. Warren had very little he wanted to say to her and the feeling went both ways. At the very least it seemed that Ira was keeping to herself out of a lack of anything productive to say to him. Warren was brooding, for the most part. Not long after they reached the island they were changing trains to run north of Times Square along the east side of central park. Of course from under ground the only way you had of knowing your location by the stops they continuously called out. Warren absently watched the tiles changing with each stop until they reached his. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn't so much that he 'let her know' that it was their stop as he just simply got up and walked out and expected her to follow. If she wanted to play this game of follow the leader he might as well give her something to do. He was more interested in seeing if she would follow his lead at all or if this was all just some clever ruse to get his back turned just enough for her to slide a knife in it. Seemed a bit ridiculous to go through this sort of trouble just to kill a man who had wronged you, but women, in his mind, could be very crafty and evidently took more pleasure in the ruse than the actual retaliation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You know, you're not a very personable leader,&quot; Ira commented as she caught up. From the tone of her voice Warren guessed she wasn't entirely thrilled with his method of 'letting her know'. He tried not to smile.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You could always relieve me of my duties,&quot; he quipped back, perhaps a little too hopeful. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Oh no, I wouldn't do that to you.&quot; Warren didn't like the menacing tone in her voice, but he couldn't help but notice the way she was looking at him. It made him decidedly uncomfortable. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What?&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You really don't want to stay with us.&quot; It was a simple observation on her part. &quot;Why?&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Do you even 'ave to ask? This entire situation is...delicate,&quot; it was all he could think to say.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That isn't the truth, at least not all of it. You'll tell me eventually,&quot; Ira concluded and seemed to be changing the topic. <br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I am sure,&quot; Warren snorted under his breath. He had no intention of disclosing anything, least of all to her. Not to mention he disliked that tone of hers that suggested she knew what he'd do before he even did. Who was she to dictate his life? If anything, wasn't he supposed to be the leader in this very awkward relationship?<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shoving those thoughts aside he led the way down the crowded avenue toward his old apartment that he was, for lack of better words, growing out of. It came to his shock to see the stoop crisscrossed with yellow tape. There was still an officer at the steps but Warren had lived long enough in this world to know trouble when he smelled it. With a quick movement he grabbed Ira by the arm and tugged her back into the alleyway. <br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Warren what are you--&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;<i>Shh</i>,&quot; he commanded sharply. &quot;That's my apartment.&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ira was bright and caught on to his meaning in short order. &quot;I see. Is there something I should know, Mr. Bancroft?&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You know exactly what I do at this point,&quot; he muttered, eyes locked on the window above the stoop as if it were a portal for information. &quot;I know one other thing.&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;And what is that?&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I am going to need to buy new clothes.&quot;</lj-cut>"

Fun times.<br /><br /></span></span><lj-cut text=""Hunting""><span><span>Vincent's left temple throbbed mercilessly and he could feel the wet trickle running down all the way to his neck and knew he was bleeding. With a hissed curse he threw all his weight against the wall behind him just to remain standing. &quot;Marcus?!&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No response. The air stunk of spilled blood; lycan blood. Oh they had been right about there being a wolf living in this apartment complex but evidently sending just two of their members was not enough. A shaking hand lifted to where blood was still oozing from the gash in his forehead and once again checked for bite marks. None, same as last time. He had to be sure. <br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A crash brought him out of his needless worry.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Marcus?&quot; Vincent grunted as he pushed himself away from the wall. His body gave a protest to the movement but he ignored the complaints. They had been separated after the initial attack in the living room; Mr. Sanders apparently didn't live alone. Vincent had dealt with the unexpected party but Marcus was not with him then and he wasn't sure where he was now.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Vince?&quot; The voice was coming from behind him.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Vincent whirled around with enough force to quite nearly send his precarious balance over the edge. A hand caught him by the arm but before he could get a question on his lips the hand jerked him hard to the side just as the sensation of movement registered from his right. &quot;You didn't deal with him?!&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;That's what I was about to tell you!&quot; Marcus yelled back, dragging his partner out of the reach of the half-transformed beast snarling in the middle of the living room floor. <br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Then I will,&quot; Vincent's voice was now unnervingly calm. He pulled away from Marcus who was flanking the half-crouched figure as he moved around to its other side. Based on the low snarl he estimated he was no more than three feet away. Plenty close to get a quick swipe in. To the observer it would seem as if the silver dagger had just appeared in Vincent's left hand. A quiet breath helped clear his mind. The battle ground was no place for distraction. <br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Vincent!&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The blind hunter was already moving by the time Marcus could yelp. He had heard the talons scratching on the bare wood floor and ducked as the beast leaped for him. With his right foot pivoting his left lifted out to the side in a quick flip kick, the top of his boot impacted the creature beneath the ribs as he flew past. The wall groaned with the collision of the massive beast. &quot;Don't try that again,&quot; Vincent facetiously admonished.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The hunter took a step forward and listened to the creature as he gained his footing again.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You're not as senseless as you look,&quot; it grunted in a warped sound of a voice. <br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I'll have to take your word on that. Tell me, are you as ugly as you sound?&quot; As he taunted his right hand disappeared into the confines of his jacket.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only reply was an angry snarl. Vincent braced himself. The jarring force sent him sprawling to the floor with a wet mass of thick hair and sinewy muscle pinning him to the cold floor. He could smell the creature's breath and tried not to cough and gag. The sting of sharp talons on his shoulders drew a brief cringe. Marcus was yelping like a startled child.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I'll show you ugly, Hunter.&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Do you know what the interesting thing about silver is?&quot; Vincent asked almost casually as he impaled the sharp needle of the syringe hidden in his right hand into the howling beast. &quot;It comes in all shapes and sizes. Silver Nitrate,&quot; he further explained as his thumb depressed the plunger and pushed the clear liquid into the wolf atop him. <br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With a howl of unworldly pain the creature released its death grip on the blind man beneath him and rolled to the ground with the deadly syringe sticking up from his side. Fur gave way to skin and back to fur again as he writhed and thrashed on the ground, his body switching between human and wolf at a dizzying pace. Claws racked the wooden floor drawing out deep gashes with each pass until finally all of him stilled. Vincent knew at that point it was over. <br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With a sigh the hunter got to his feet and brushed himself off; job well done. From the distance, perhaps in the other room down the hall, he heard a noise that made his blood chill through his veins. It wasn't a threatening sound, at least not physically. It threatened something much more precious to The Order; it threatened his sanity and his conviction.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Daddy?&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He'd been hit many times that night; by fists, by claws, by kicks, and by something he assumed had once been a chair leg. Nothing ever had hit him quite this hard or stole so much of his breath.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Daddy? Daddy?! DADDY!&quot;<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The small voice was getting louder and Vincent knew she had run to the fallen corpse on the ground that had once been her father. He'd been taught that these things happened. Lycans had the ability to mate both with humans and other lycans. Vampires did not have that kind of a threat to a man's sanity. He also knew what he was supposed to do in a situation like this but it was just as clear to him when faced with it he couldn't follow through.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As it turned out he didn't have to. The sound was loud enough to jar him out of his shock and louder still to force him back a few steps. Though he'd never use one he knew all too well what they sounded like. He knew the target without even having to ask. Marcus has shot her.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I...it...&quot; Marcus stammered, obviously underestimating what killing a child in cold blood would do to a man.<br /> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You were following procedure,&quot; Vincent heard himself saying without any real conviction. <br /> </span></span></span></span></lj-cut>"

Inside the paint was peeling in small patches along the walls and a tile or two were missing from the floor.

Mid-forties, Vincent guessed. African American; possibly from the east coast. There wasn&rsquo;t a need for a guide. Vincent had been in this courthouse enough times to have the basic floor plan memorized, but he allowed himself to be led all the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The case wasn&rsquo;t particularly interesting today. A couple was filing for a divorce and it seemed neither of them spoke a good deal of English.

He was used to the slight disbelief people expressed when they learned he could speak a multitude of foreign languages; Mandarin included. As Marcus put it he looked &lsquo;too white&rsquo; to speak any language other than English. If only he knew what &lsquo;white&rsquo; meant he might have a better understanding. Apparently it was the color of his hair and skin. The doctors he had been taken to as a child had a name for it; albinism. How he looked had never been much of a concern for him, though he did understand it had more of an impact on others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; the judge was saying. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get on with it then. You can start by telling both Mr. and Mrs. &ndash;Teeang,&rdquo; she struggled to decide on how to pronounce the name, &ldquo;to be silent until spoken to.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;Of course, your Honor.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mandarin wasn&rsquo;t his strongest language and the unhappily married couple spoke an odd dialect of it; he did manage to get the point across for them to quiet down, though.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;Do I dare ask what has brought the both of you here today?&rdquo; She nodded her head toward Vincent before catching herself, but he was already firing away in the couple&rsquo;s native language. How anyone could make sense out of those sounds was beyond her comprehension.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;He is a pig!&rdquo; Vincent translated rather animatedly. His voice had even changed in pitch. &ldquo;He brings home young women all night. I have the right to be rid of him. He broke the rules. He is guilty!&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;She is a liar!&rdquo; Again Vincent&rsquo;s voice changed to indicate who he was translating for. It almost made him feel like he had some sort of split personality disorder. &ldquo;Those women work for me, she is just an old, jealous woman. She&rsquo;s crazy.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;I am not crazy, he&rsquo;s a pig!&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; This time it was the judge yelling. &ldquo;One at a time.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Vincent translated the judge&rsquo;s orders.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start with the wife.

Warren felt a little less than optimistic about his chances here, but he knew his chances back in France were a great deal worse. There was only so many times you could change your name and birth date before someone began to catch on; and only so many times you could claim to have an uncanny resemblance to an old relative someone once remembered. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>New York City was not his first choice of places to live. Saint Louis was promising and so was New Orleans. Montreal was far too cold for his tastes and what the locals spoke could not in good conscience be called French. No matter where his travels took him he always found that the cities weren&rsquo;t big enough for a man to disappear into. That is until he stumbled upon the Big Apple. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A man could truly disappear in a city of this size. If your face became too familiar it was a simple matter to move to the island or out in Queens and you would once again blend back into society. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the moment he was attempting to find a new apartment and liked to do his scouting at night. It wasn&rsquo;t so much that he cared about the view; it was more about what went on in the neighborhoods at night. The noisier the better. A bonus if it was located near machinery of some kind, or perhaps a cemetery where strange noises would be written off as an over active imagination. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was well past midnight when his casual searching brought him into the Industrial district and from the sounds going on all around him even at this late hour it looked promising. Not far off there was the sound of a train rumbling by. Oddly, he noticed, there was a park not far off nestled between construction sites. Probably a vestige of a neighborhood that used to be here, he guessed. <span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>His stroll took him through the park; the old benches were rusted and forlorn like the rest of the area. This kind of rundown scenery was oddly appealing to him. His senses were preoccupied on taking in the sights and he didn&rsquo;t notice the rustle of leaves and snapping of twigs until it was far too late to do anything but react.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The blow came at his left side, a steel toed boot cracked against ribs pulling out a low grunt from Warren&rsquo;s chest. He used the momentum to roll once he hit the mossy ground and took that inertia right up to standing again. Now he could see his assailant. A man in what looked to be his late thirties with dirty blond hair cropped short stood in a ready stance facing him. The precise state of his beard indicated to Warren that the man wasn&rsquo;t homeless. It begged the question as to why he was attacking him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The low growl answered that. With a few sniffs to the air he confirmed what his ears were telling him: a Wolf. &ldquo;I am not &lsquo;ere to pick a fight,&rdquo; Warren grunted. His side was aching but already it had begun to heal internally. &ldquo;Whatever it is you think you &lsquo;ave against me I would ask that you reconsider it.&rdquo; Warren wasn&rsquo;t a push over. He had served in two world wars and had witnessed enough horrors to last several men their lifetimes. If he could avoid a bloody confrontation he would certainly try.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trespassing,&rdquo; the other Wolf said. Warren would have expected him to sound more aggressive but the other man&rsquo;s tone was almost formal; certainly very matter of fact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;I did not know that I was.

The relief turned a little sour when he heard the sound of a familiar voice coming up behind him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re late,&rdquo; Marcus said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;Actually I&rsquo;m right on time.

But he&rsquo;s not here right now, is he? Like it or not, you work for me. Now, where exactly is this rogue dog?&rdquo; Vincent was cutting the argument short. He already had to show Marcus his place before back at the complex and he hated repeating himself. Marcus wasn&rsquo;t a bad guy but he tended to put far too much stock in appearances and didn&rsquo;t think a blind man could tie his own shoes let alone do the kind of things the job required of them. Vincent had decided to make it a personal goal to constantly prove his partner wrong.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;Need me to hold your hand?&rdquo; Marcus was clearly not pleased with being cut off from a perfectly good chance at an argument.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;Only if you intend to buy me dinner,&rdquo; Vincent quipped with a light smile on his face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Marcus grunted his appraisal of that offer with a few choice words. &ldquo;Just try and keep up. I ain&rsquo;t going to watch both our backs and I know you ain&rsquo;t gonna be watching mine.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Vincent merely continued to smile as he followed the pattering sound of Marcus&rsquo; footsteps; his ability to follow was uncanny. Marcus had already accused him of pretending to be blind, though what purpose that would serve was beyond Vincent&rsquo;s ability to figure out. He&rsquo;d never had to prove his blindness to anyone before Marcus and doubted he&rsquo;d need to prove it to anyone after. His partner was just a very special kind of person. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;You did remember to bring the weapons, right?&rdquo; Vincent asked. It would be a terribly unfortunate thing to confront a wild animal without them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;Yeah, of course I did.

There are laws against that kind of thing, you know. Hand it over.&rdquo; Vincent&rsquo;s hand latched onto his partner&rsquo;s arm to halt them both in their brisk walk. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Marcus jerked his arm out of the other&rsquo;s grip with a grumble. &ldquo;Fine, but you&rsquo;re not getting the gun.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;Good. I have terrible aim. The syringe and link will do. A dagger, too, if you have one.&rdquo; Vincent was surprisingly skilled at hand to hand combat and didn&rsquo;t like to rely on weapons to subdue a target, but when he had to choose he preferred something light and agile. After Marcus unceremoniously handed over the gear he thanked him facetiously before tucking away the equipment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not long after the exchange, Vincent held up a hand to stop Marcus, his first two fingers lifting from a closed fist to indicate that his order shouldn&rsquo;t be questioned. The smell was light, almost too faint to be noticed but Vincent&rsquo;s sense of smell was heightened far beyond an average human&rsquo;s. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting close.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;No shit, Sherlock. His home ain&rsquo;t that far away.&rdquo; Marcus grumbled something after that sounded to Vincent a good deal like &lsquo;I knew I&rsquo;d end up babysitting&rsquo;. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;Good. He doesn&rsquo;t travel too far from home, then. That will make containment easier, and if you don&rsquo;t want to be put on clean up duty I suggest you keep your comments to yourself.&rdquo; Vincent wasn&rsquo;t a very vindictive man by any standards but he was known on occasion to think up some particularly unpleasant shifts for those who disobeyed him. &ldquo;Lead on, but do so quietly, I&rsquo;d like to have the advantage of surprise in this.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;Aye aye, <i style="""">sir</i>,&rdquo; Marcus said sarcastically. This was going to be a long night, but he&rsquo;d let the rookie get in deep on his own if that was the way he wanted to play this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p align=""center"" style=""text-align: center;"" class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"">*** <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Warren could taste blood and wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure if it was his own or the other man&rsquo;s. The pair of them rolled down the slope of a small hill, Warren grunting as his back collided with a random rock protruding from the ground. Both men&rsquo;s hands had transformed, long and slender claws extended from where finger nails once were. Even their eyes had changed. Warren&rsquo;s took on a dark crimson while the stranger&rsquo;s were a golden hazel. It was fortunate that the full moon was a good week away or Warren would have had to be concerned with losing all control to the Wolf. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A snarl made him think his opponent wasn&rsquo;t so concerned about maintaining control. They had stopped their rolling with Warren pinning the man to the ground but the shoulders beneath his hands were shifting in a sickening fashion. He had just enough time to thrust himself back before the other Wolf lashed out with more muscular arms than he had just a moment ago. With a cringe and a sinking feeling Warren realized to win this fight he had to give in to his baser instincts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While his opponent writhed on the ground in the midst of the change he followed suit. Joints popped and twisted out of shape. Muscle grew and shrunk, undulating beneath his skin that was now sprouting fur. In a moment both men were nowhere to be seen and in their places stood two wolves snarling viciously at each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The light colored wolf lunged first, his gaping maw aimed for the ebony one&rsquo;s neck. Again they latched together with claws raking deep against flesh and tumbled to the ground. A mixture of snarls and yelps filled the air over the course of the next tense twenty minutes. Neither of them had a significant upper hand in this fight and they were both limping and exhausted by the end of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It had to be finished and soon. Warren understood that even as his mind reverted to a more primal state full of instinct and sensation rather than thought and tactics. This had to end or he would be the one to die tonight. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;Jonathan!&rdquo; It was a female voice full of shock and intensity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Warren took the split second to attack. His jaws clamed down around the wolf&rsquo;s neck and all four sets of claws dug in deep to hold on while he thrashed. Blood nearly choked him as it ran down his throat and over his muzzle to matt down his fur. The other wolf struggled admirably but Warren refused to let go; refused to die. It took a solid minute for the other body to go limp beneath him and even then he still didn&rsquo;t let go. It wasn&rsquo;t until hands were pulling him off that he finally let go.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The woman whose voice he had heard was yanking on him by the scruff of his neck and she showed no reverence as she tossed him aside.

She bowed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It took a great deal out of him to reshape himself into a human form.

With an ungraceful stumble he attempted to keep his balance but ended up toppling straight to the ground in front of her feet. Both hands managed to stay clasped to his genitals but decency was the least of his concerns now.</span></p></lj-cut><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><o:p></o:p></span></p>"

Goddamn. I&nbsp;can't stand those books/movies where the protagonists are all under the age of 20 and have barely gotten over puberty. I&nbsp;wouldn't trust a teen with a credit card, why the fuck should I&nbsp;trust them to save THE&nbsp;WORLD? I guess people just market their ideas to teens. Teens should get over it and enjoy some protagonists who know what the fuck they're doing. Even the damn Werewolves and Vampires who are 34198470271384 years old LOOK&nbsp;AND&nbsp;ACT&nbsp;LIKE&nbsp;TEENAGERS. What a load of crap. I'm looking directly at you Twilight. Burn in the deepest part of hell.

	</style> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Prologue""><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">Liriel was not all that confident in his scribe abilities; not in the least considering the abruptness of his promotion. His complexion wasn't nearly as luminous as the other Celestials pouring into the great hall where the Elders held their august meetings. Fingers twitched nervously over the orb in his pocket, gliding along the smooth glass-like surface of the recording device. For an instant the young Celestial was blinded by the brightness of the great hall as he entered with the rest of the masses preparing for the council's arrival.</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	The auspiciousness of the High Council wasn't the only thing that could make a young scribe nervous about the place. The ceiling extended into the heavens, or so it seemed, towering above the sleek, gleaming surface of the marble floors. Liriel could see his reflection in the large slabs and took a moment to tuck shimmering curls behind an ear. The room expanded on all sides and Liriel had a feeling he might be swallowed whole if he wasn't careful. Spectral light hung in the air like the stars that they hung in the expanse of the universe, reflecting down below on the ebony surface of the bench that ran in a wide U where the Elders would take their places soon.</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	Liriel had always wanted to have been one of the elite who arranged the heavens, or perhaps even a Guide, but he took his job as a scribe seriously. He must have stalled while admiring the council hall because there was a very austere Celestial beckoning him sharply.</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	&ldquo;Come along, Liriel. You are not here to see the sites.&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	&ldquo;Y-yes, of course,&rdquo; was Liriel's timid reply. </font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	His guide led him to the second tier of benches set back from the first and offered a wave of his hand to indicate for Liriel to take a seat to his left. He had yet to be assigned to a council member but figured that the process was far less formal than he had at first imagined. </font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	&ldquo;You do know how to operate an orb, correct?&rdquo; His voice was smooth and calculated as it nudged against Liriel's thoughts. It had been a great while since any Celestial had a use for his vocal chords.</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	&ldquo;I do. I didn't know using an orb was permitted in the High Council.&rdquo; Liriel mused between the two of them.</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	&ldquo;They aren't. At least not by ordinary citizens. You have clearance to use yours. Do try and keep up.&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	The Seraphim was not exaggerating. No sooner than Liriel retrieved the silvery orb from his pocket the head of the Elders began to speak. Liriel's hands worked furiously over the sparkling ball of energy floating just at his chest. Each finger dipped into the silvery threads weaving them to and fro in the undulating currents just beneath the orb's surface. Together the threads spelled out the thoughts of the Council with a specific focus on the member sitting just before him. </font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	The subject was changing from the opening agenda to a more pressing issue; if the tone of their collective thoughts were anything to go by.</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	&ldquo;Humanity has gone far enough. They have refused the idols. Some even talk of us as mere superstitions. Figments of their imaginations! We have lost all control.&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	&ldquo;Blasphemy to this extreme is unforgivable.&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	&ldquo;Force may be necessary.&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	Liriel's fingers nearly tied themselves into knots, the pure force behind these thoughts were almost enough to send the small scribe toppling over backwards.</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	&ldquo;Please, High Council,&rdquo; Liriel perked as his assigned member spoke up, &ldquo;we knew this was a possibility since The Great War began. Lucifer's damage has been dealt, there is no escaping that. We should focus more on controlling this outbreak of freewill before it spreads any further.&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	&ldquo;And what do you propose?&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	&ldquo;Starting over, quite simply.&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	A clamor rose up so forcefully in Liriel's mind that he nearly let the orb plummet to the floor. He only nearly managed to avoid a scene by catching the free falling sphere in one hand before replacing it. Dazed, his fingers only kept up with the flow of arguments from a lifetime of practice at the art of thought weaving. Finally clarity returned as the Elders reclaimed the discussion.</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	&ldquo;Humanity is still yet too young to be tossed aside. Yet--&rdquo; Liriel noted that the glossy robes and authoritative tone meant the speaker was at the head of the Elders. &ldquo;Yet we cannot deny the risk they pose to order. Let it be decided, then, that we should hold the keys to their destruction. If a time ever comes we will be prepared to deal with them then.&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	&ldquo;Would it not be too tempting for one of us to possess all of the keys and command power over both our plane and theirs?&rdquo; Liriel's eyes were trained on his superior as he spoke mentally to the entire council. &ldquo;Why do we not instead spread the keys about the Earth in only the locations parts of us know and parts of us do not; then not one of our number can wield that kind of power without the consent of the whole.&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	&ldquo;Adriel makes a sound point. We should also dictate on of our kind to reside among Humanity as a guardian and a herald for when the time has come to end them.&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	&ldquo;A wise choice,&rdquo; Adriel didn't sound all that convinced, &ldquo;but who shall we send?&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	&ldquo;Why not the one whose idea it was.&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	Liriel sensed more than saw the tension in Adriel's being; and though he barely knew the Seraph he thought he detected a note of disdain in his projected thoughts.</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	&ldquo;Are you sure a Council member should be absent from his post for such a duration?&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	&ldquo;I'm sure your presence will be missed,&rdquo; the High Elder's tone seemed to indicate otherwise. &ldquo;It would be unwise to send anyone of a lower rank. The knowledge of the existence of these keys is not to leave this chamber.&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	Liriel could feel the tension almost as tangibly as he could feel the orb's threads wrapping around his fingers. The entire chamber stilled as the two Elders held a private mental argument. No orb would record these thoughts. Both of their eyes were aglow and locked together across the ebony bench. Liriel wasn't sure but he thought he could see their reflections flickering on its glossy surface. When it seemed the pair would continue this private debate indefinitely, the silence was broken by the High Council's de facto leader.</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	&ldquo;Then it is settled. Adriel will oversee Humanity's progress from Earth and will not have access to the keys.&rdquo;	</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	The rest of the meeting was a blur of motion as Liriel's fingers rushed to keep up with the flurry of thoughts. None of the debates were anywhere near as heated nor as tense as the one Adriel had been a part of. The Seraph was conspicuously quiet for the remainder of the talks. When it was over, Adriel stalked from the chambers without a glance to Liriel.</font></font></p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font face=""Trebuchet MS, sans-serif""><font size=""2"">	It had been his first time as a scribe for a High Council member and now it looked as if it was also his last. </font></font></p></lj-cut><br /></meta></meta></meta></meta></meta></meta>"

"event","So Jack yoinked this from the NaNoWriMo forum and I&nbsp;yoinked it then from him. Here goes.<br /><br /><strong>The Nine Temperments</strong><br />Active or Passive<br />Law or Chaos<br />Approach or Withdraw<br />Flexible or Stubborn<br />Intense or Calm<br />Happy or Upset<br />Distracted or Driven<br />Persistent or Irresolute<br />Sensitive or Blunt<br /><lj-cut text=""I have nothing witty to put here.""><br /><strong>Vincent</strong><br /><em>Passive</em> - Vincent is anything but lazy but he does better with fine motor skill activities rather than hyperactive activities. When he's not in training he's 'reading' or listening to music/radio talk shows. <br /><em>Law</em> - he has a schedule and he prefers to stick to it. The man can tell time without needed to consult a clock and rarely needs an alarm to wake him. <br /><em>Withdraw</em> - he has learned the hard way what rushing in can do. 'Look before you leap' doesn't quite apply so Vincent listens and feels before he responds. Only exception is in a fight where instinct and training give him quick reflexes and not enough time to think through every action.<br /><em>Stubborn - </em>simple answer to how Vincent deals with change is that he doesn't. Even if it is necessary for his type of work. Just because he seems to be going along with the change in plans does not in any way mean he enjoys it. If it's for the greater good he'll keep his complaints to himself.<br /><em>Calm</em> - almost disturbingly so. It takes a bit to move him to intense emotion but when you do you had better stand back. <br /><em>Upset</em>- content is probably a better word. Vincent is neither overly optimistic or overly pessimistic though he does lean more toward the latter.<br /><em>Driven</em> - the task is not done until it's done. Vincent can stay on target despite external distractions.<br /><em>Persistent</em> - he sticks to the plan with his nose to the grindstone. Mostly. <br /><em>Sensitive</em> - when not focused on a particular task he can be very sensitive to noise and touch. Vincent uses these traits to aid his fighting ability. <br /><br /><strong>Gabriel</strong><br /><em>Active</em> - though not in the sense that he's always running around wildly. If you've ever tried to throw clay on a wheel you know it is anything but a calm and uneventful process. He puts energy into his creations and puts in a good deal of hours at the kiln. <br /><em>Chaos</em> - schedules are all well and good but freedom of expression is much better. Gabriel might occasionally sleep in or go to bed at an odd hour due to being up all night with the kiln. Coffee is for the times when life meets sleep schedule and bulldozes over it. <br /><em>Approach</em> - Gabriel is a very friendly and outgoing sort, at least when it's safe to do so. He seldom makes any lasting friends for safety's sake, but he isn't shy to talk to people even if he doesn't allow himself the luxury of getting close.<br /><em>Flexible</em> - an artist very well has to be. When a pot explodes in the kiln you start over and learn from the mistake. When tempers explode you adapt to calm the situation. Gabriel fits this mold better than most. He is a natural peace keeper. <br /><em>Intense</em> - when he's happy it shows, when he's down it also shows. Gabriel doesn't throw fits of rage or tantrums but he is excitable, particularly when a student finally gets the hang of pulling handles. <br /><em>Happy</em> - even if at times he feels he has no right to be. There are dark times but on the whole Gabriel is optimistic. Or at the very least he doesn't always let his darker moods show as much as he does his better moods.<br /><em>Distracted</em> - not to say he can't finish a task but his mind does have the tendency to wander if nothing is holding its attention. <br /><em>Persistent</em> - adversity to a task only makes it more worthwhile to complete. The harder the clay fights him the more enjoyable the product is when he finally masters it. Gabriel doesn't back down from challenges that he knows he can meet and conquer. <br /><em>Sensitive</em> - he can tell the moods around him and has a keen sense of smell and eyesight thanks to his wolf. <br />-- He's almost exactly opposite of Vincent. Huh. Didn't see that coming and neither did the Hunter. lol blind joke, I&nbsp;slay me. <br /><br /><strong>Ilya</strong><br /><em>Passive</em> - only time Ilya is aroused to action is when his House needs protection or discipline. The Patron is content with a good book and a better glass of wine. <br /><em>Law</em> - he keeps his own schedule but it is fairly routine. <br /><em>Withdraw</em> - he likes to watch first and approach later when he feels he has the upper hand by knowing more about the other party than they know about him. Ilya is very wary around those he doesn't know anything about and soon finds out everything he can at his first convenience.<br /><em>Stubborn</em> - he is used to having things go his way and is very abhorrent to having his plans change without his notice. <br /><em>Calm</em> - cold as ice is more aptly put. The Vampire has no difficulty keeping his emotions to himself almost to the point where it is anyone's guess if he feels them at all anymore.<br /><em>Happy</em> - if by happy you mean content with what he has and where he is. He is by no means 'bubbly' or 'giddy'. Ever.<br /><em>Driven</em> - barely anything can distract the man from his goal. It is little wonder how he has come from being a peasant in the house of Petrov to being its Praotet. <br /><em>Persistent</em> - it goes along with what was said for driven.<br /><em>Blunt</em> - it isn't that he is oblivious to his surroundings it's just that he doesn't care. If he's reading a good book it wont matter how many times you shout his name he isn't going to hurry through his reading any faster for you. And you'll probably shut up the second time you yell with collapsed vocal chords. He will get to you on his time, not yours.<br /><br /><strong>Warren</strong><br /><em>Active</em> - remnants from life as a soldier. If he's not working out he's carving furniture or sanding pieces to be painted later or building something new for the pack's communal lodging.<br /><em>Law</em> - another remnant from his soldiering days. Warren gets cranky if he goes to bed late.<br /><em>Approach</em> - shoot first ask questions...never. Warren goes in with both guns blazing before questioning if that's the best course of action or not.<br /><em>Stubborn</em> - if things don't go the way he planned then god help the poor soul standing nearest him.<br /><em>Intense</em> - when he's angry you'll know it, probably because your nose is now broken.<br /><em>Upset</em> - life is miserable, you just have to try and make it less miserable for you. Warren's more of a realist than a pessimist but he does meander over into the pessimist's camp from time to time.<br /><em>Driven</em> - he has goals and will do whatever is necessary to meet them.<br /><em>Irresolute </em>- failure is not looked on well. If he can't do it right the first time then he doesn't want to do it at all. This is why when he tries to paint landscapes many brushes end up broken on the floor.<br /><em>Sensitive</em> - noise distracts him and pisses him off. Keep your music down while he tries to paint or it won't be the brushes that end up broken.</lj-cut><br /><br />"

"event","Ilya Petrov is NOT my character either. People have been donating them to me for this book and I&nbsp;thank them lots. This one is from my main squeeze over at see_jack_write. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Ilya Petrov"">The Questions<br />Date this form was created: October 6, 2008<br />Full name of Character: Ilya Andreiovich Petrov<br />Reason, meaning or purpose behind the name: Andreiovich is a patronymic (father&rsquo;s name was Andrei). Petrov is the name of the House that took him in. I actually don&rsquo;t remember what his original last name was, but it&rsquo;s not relevant.<br />Nickname: None<br />Reason for nickname:<br />Race: Human-turned-vampire.<br />Occupation/class: Aristocrat, head of the Petrov House<br />Social class: Upper<br />Physical Appearance: See the next several questions.<br />Age: Around 140<br />How old they appear: 30something<br />Eye Color: Grayish-blue<br />Glasses or contacts?: None<br />Hair color length and style: Blond to the point of being nearly white, kept neat and short.<br />Weight and height: 6&rsquo;0, and as usual I can&rsquo;t visualize weights.<br />Type of body (build): Tall and slender; neither overly muscular nor too thin<br />Skin tone and type (i.e., harry, slimy, scaly, oily, fair, burns easily): Pale; bloodless enough to look almost blue-tinted in the right light.<br />Shape of face: Hurm. Kind of long, angular. High cheekbones.<br />Distinguishing marks: None that I can think of right now.<br />Predominant feature: Not sure. Piercing eyes?<br />Is s/he healthy? As much as a pseudo-dead person can be.<br />If not, why not? Or why are they healthy? Ilya keeps himself in extremely good &lsquo;health&rsquo;. As much as that applies. Eats well.<br />Do they look healthy? Why/why not? See above.<br /><br />Favorites:<br />Char&rsquo;s favorite color: Deep red.<br />Least favorite, why? Neon yellow, or really anything obnoxious like that. His eyes are sensitive.<br />Music? Classical, baroque, especially from Russia.<br />Least favorite music, why? I&rsquo;m not sure, but I bet he&rsquo;d hate metal.<br />Food: He doesn&rsquo;t really&hellip;need to eat much these days.<br />Literature: Ilya likes the classics. Gogol,  Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky. Occasionally things from further west as well.<br />Expressions:<br />Expletives (curse): Ilya&rsquo;s very polite-spoken. If he does swear, it&rsquo;s probably not more extreme than &lsquo;Damn!&rsquo; (or, uh, whatever the Russian equivalent of that is).<br />Mode of transport: Whatever gets him where he&rsquo;s going. He&rsquo;s not picky, and despite being sort of old-fashioned, he has nothing against planes.<br />Hobbies: Reading, writing, occasionally listening to music. He totally has a phonograph. <br />How do they spend a rainy day? See above.<br />Personality: Very sure of himself, to the point of being arrogant, but not in the loud, brash way. Quietly smug. Possessive of what belongs to him. A little ruthless when it comes to House business; he&rsquo;s basically a good man, but don&rsquo;t get on his bad side.<br />Are they a daredevil or cautious? Cautious. He&rsquo;s been around long enough to know that you should look before you leap. Worth noting that this was not always true; as a young man, he was a lot more idealistic and reckless .<br />Do they act the same alone as when with someone? This is such a weird question. I guess around people, he is more aware of the image he has to hold up as someone in his position.<br />Drinks: Blood and wine, mostly.<br />How much: What, the wine? Not excessively, maybe a glass or two with dinner every morning.<br />Greatest Strength: That&rsquo;s a toss-up between self-confidence and the wisdom of experience.<br />Greatest Weakness: Overly covetous of his possessions, maybe.<br />Soft spot: I&rsquo;m not sure Ilya has one in particular. He&rsquo;s pretty compassionate towards women and children. Oh! Does Tatiana&rsquo;s memory count? Cause that. Totally that.<br />Is their soft spot obvious, why/why not: He doesn&rsquo;t talk about her much, largely  because he&rsquo;s just not that close to anyone.<br />If not, how do they hide it: For all his importance in his part of the world, he&rsquo;s a very private person.<br />Biggest Vulnerability: There&rsquo;s no one he cares intensely about right now, but when there is, that&rsquo;s a major weakness. It doesn&rsquo;t happen often. When it does, it&rsquo;s a big deal.<br />Background: Raised in a small town. Pretty much destined to be a farmer, in keeping with his family, but always wanted better things. Dreamt of being a writer. Idealistic. Turned vampire by pure bad luck at the age of 23 or so. Taken in and nursed back to health by Tatiana (BAWWWW). Eventually becomes part of the Petrov House. Falls hard for Tatiana. At this point, things get very sad.<br />Hometown: Unnamed small town somewhere near Lake Baikal.<br />Type of childhood: Fairly typical for a country boy of that age; not much to go around, and a lot of hard work. Close-knit family.<br />First Memory:<br />Most important child hood event that still effects him/her:<br />Why? Why does that still affect him? Ffffff can I get back to you on these?<br />Education: Minimal as a child, but once he assumed some degree of power in the Petrov house, he was able to get some formal education. Prior to that, he mostly learned from his parents and later from Grigory &ndash; practical knowledge, some history and literature.<br />Religion: None to speak of.<br />Finances: Very well-off. He knows the right people.<br />Family: All deceased, by this point. Initially he had some brothers and sisters who have not been given names yet, but after he was turned, he had to distance himself for their safety.<br />Mother: Marina Ivanova<br />Relationship with her: Deceased; they were close when he was young.<br />Father: Andrei Sokolov<br />Relationship with him: See mother; same deal. <br />Siblings, How many, relationship with each:<br />Children of siblings:<br />Other extended family: iiiii honestly don&rsquo;t know. He&rsquo;s closer to the Petrov House these days. Maybe I should be writing about them. They&rsquo;ve become very large and powerful, but he&rsquo;s not personally close to anyone. Business relationships all around.<br />Close? Why or why not:<br />Attitude: Calm. Composed. Self-assured.<br />Most at ease when: the House is running smoothly and he can spend a night at home, with a glass of wine in one hand and a pen in the other.<br />Most ill at ease when: politics get too overblown, or conflict pops up &ndash; with other Houses or with other races.<br />Priorities: Keeping the House in order, keeping the House&rsquo;s image up, and enjoying himself. In about that order.<br />Philosophies: He&rsquo;s gotten jaded over the years, but I think deep down he probably still believes in some of his nobler ideals. People can do great things when given the opportunity; people can get along and operate together without the threat of an oppressive ruler. He sees the world as being too centered on emotion and ego.<br />How they feel about themselves: Generally very confident. He&rsquo;s got reason to be. Again, this is a major change from his younger years; it took him a long time to feel like he really deserved/could handle his position.<br />Past failure they would be embarrassed to admit: I&rsquo;m not sure embarrassed is the right world, but he&rsquo;s always blamed himself for Tatiana&rsquo;s death.<br />Why? Well, he did get her pregnant.<br />If granted one wish what would it be, why? This is an excellent question. My first thought is &ldquo;Tatiana back&rdquo;. Barring that, I&rsquo;m really not sure.<br />Traits: This feels a little redundant&hellip;<br />Optimist or pessimist? Why? Realist. He really doesn&rsquo;t go one way or the other. Plus, I think his tendency to hope and believe that the best can happen tends to butt heads with what he&rsquo;s actually experienced of the world. I guess he&rsquo;s closer to pessimistic.<br />Introvert or extrovert? Why? He networks well with people, but given the choice, he&rsquo;d rather spend an evening alone. Probably just because it gets tiring, running an organization that size.<br />Drives and motives: The Petrov House. He takes its position very seriously. He&rsquo;s also&hellip;I wouldn&rsquo;t call him a pacifist, but he does try to keep things from boiling over in dealings with humans/lycans/the Order/etc. That being said, he&rsquo;s not going to sacrifice his safety or that of his House for any of them. <br />Talents: Writing, motivating people (he&rsquo;s sort of a natural leader by now). Not bad in a physical fight.<br />Extremely skilled at: Commanding respect.<br />Extremely unskilled at: Hard to say. After a hundred-something years, you have a lot of time to get good at a lot of things. I guess he has trouble letting go of the past some time. Oh, and opening up to people. He&rsquo;s gotten really bad at that.<br />Good characteristics: Charismatic, intelligent, knows how to manage his resources.<br />Character flaws: Egotistical. Prejudiced.<br />Mannerisms: Elegant, slightly old-fashioned speech patterns. Reserved manner; he keeps his cool.<br />Peculiarities: <br />Biggest regret: Tatiana. Absolutely Tatiana. He&rsquo;s convinced he could have saved her somehow, or just not put her in danger in the first place.<br />Minor regrets: Never getting back in touch with his family. I&rsquo;m not sure it counts as minor, but he honestly thinks about them less than he does about her.<br />Biggest accomplishment: He runs the freakin&rsquo; Petrov House!<br />Minor accomplishments: <br />Darkest secret: I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s really a &ldquo;dark secret&rdquo;, but he doesn&rsquo;t tell people how he came into the House. It all started with him being a victim, after all, and he doesn&rsquo;t like how that would reflect on him. Doesn&rsquo;t really like to think about it himself, either.<br />Does anyone know? Some of his more trusted associates, maybe. Maybe. And some of the older ones, but a lot of the people who originally knew have probably died by now.<br />How did they find out: Either they were there when it happened, or read it in the Petrov histories or something. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine Ilya having a heart-to-heart. Maybe many years ago.<br />One word they would use to describe themselves: Refined<br />One paragraph of how they would describe themselves: <br /><br />What do they consider their best physical characteristic and why: He probably doesn&rsquo;t think about this much. He knows he&rsquo;s handsome.<br />The worst one? Why? I wonder if he ever misses his heartbeat. Probably not, that just kind of popped into my head.<br />Are they realistic assessments?<br />If not, why not?<br />How they think others perceive them: Attractive, powerful.<br />What four things would they most like to change about themselves:<br />If they were changed would they be the same person, why/why not: <br />Would changing of number 1 make them more happy? Why/why not:<br />Interaction with other people: Ilya&rsquo;s good at it. He tends to take charge of situations, but even when he doesn&rsquo;t, he can listen well.<br />How do they relate to others: There aren&rsquo;t many on his level, but he treats those who are (other family heads) with a sort of cautious respect until he gets to know them better. Anyone else, he may get a little condescending with, usually not on purpose. Has very little tolerance for the Order and those with their views. Holds certain prejudices against lycans.<br />How are they perceived by strangers: Cool. Distant. Sometimes domineering.<br />Friends: A few, though people rarely get above the level of &lsquo;close acquaintance&rsquo;. He considered Grigory a best friend and mentor years back, but that was&hellip;well, years back.<br />Wife/husband/lover: BAWWW TATIANA. After her, there have been a few serious relationships, with both men and women, but for the most part he tends to take lovers for a short period and then move on. Each relationship is less intimate and personal than the last one.<br />Goals: Eventually, to find someone qualified to take over his position and maybe spend a little time in retirement. Maybe. He&rsquo;d probably get bored, but he doesn&rsquo;t know that yet.<br />Immediate: Keep the gears oiled, so to speak. Secure as much power and influence as he can for his House, and find time to enjoy himself now and then too.<br />Long term: See above.<br />How do they plan to accomplish them: Knowing the right people. Strategic takeovers. Even the occasional outright property battle.<br />How will others be effected by this: Depends. If they&rsquo;re allied with Ilya, things will probably turn out pretty good for them. If they oppose him, they do so at their own risk.<br />Problems/Crisis:<br />How do they react in a crisis: Tries to keep everyone from panicking while an answer is figured out.<br />How do they face problems: First, consult precedent. See what people have done before. Failing any clear answer, he&rsquo;s got advisors and trusted people he can turn to. Of course, instinct does factor into it, and he&rsquo;s made some gut decisions, but those are the minority.<br />Kind of problems they usually run into: Squabbles with other Houses. Trouble with the Order. Problems governing the House as it gets bigger and the overall population gets younger; it&rsquo;s hard to keep everyone in line.<br />How they react to new problems: I think this has been covered already.<br />How they react to change: Depends. Ilya can be sort of old-fashioned, and sometimes it takes him a while to really adapt to change. <br />General:<br />Favorite clothing, why: Ilya dresses like one classy dude. Expensive button-down shirts and slacks. I bet he looks pretty slick in a suit.<br />Least favorite, why: I would just like to say that I tried to picture Ilya in a t-shirt and shorts and my brain exploded.<br />Jewelry: <br />Other accessories: None that are coming to mind. Maybe a locket or something. And I bet he wears a pocket watch.<br />Drives:<br />Where do they live: Russia. Moscow, I think. But he travels a lot.<br />Where do they want to live: Moscow&rsquo;s good, thanks.<br />Spending habits, why: Ilya keeps himself surrounded by luxury, because he can.<br />What do they do too much of, why:<br />Most prized possession, why:<br />People they secretly admire, why:<br />Person they are most influenced by, why: Grigory, his old mentor, the one who basically taught him the ropes back when he was first turned. He really shaped Ilya into the person he eventually became.<br />Most important person in their life before story starts, why: Back in the day, it was Tatiana and Grigory. You already know why.<br />How do they spend the week just before the story starts: Well, that depends on where it starts. But since it&rsquo;s Ilya, fucking bitches and getting money.<br /><br />No, I&rsquo;m kidding. He probably spends it in typical Ilya fashion, meeting with important figures, making decisions about the welfare of the House, sharing expensive drinks with attractive people.</lj-cut>"

"event","<p class=""MsoNormal"">I was browsing the Romance forum on NaNoWriMo.org and found a pet peeves thread. I compiled a list of things most people seemed to hate seeing in a romance and thought I'd post them here for a reminder when&nbsp;I start writing. Granted the whole novel isn't going to be a love story but I&nbsp;am adding that element in. Here goes.<br /><br />Romance Pet Peeves. What not to do.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">The Big Misunderstanding: if it can be cleared up by just one of the two being sensible enough to act like adults and talk about it then it should not last the entire novel.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Insta-couples: Love at first sight is overdone. People need time to really develop feelings for each other and a good relationship doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Mutant Females: KNOW THE FEMALE ANATOMY.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Mutant Males: KNOW THE MALE ANATOMY.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Hyper Anatomy Focus Syndrome: It&rsquo;s a serious disease that infects romance writers wherein every bodily detail that can be described gets described. No one really needs to know about throbbing parts and gooey excretions.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Flimsy Women: If they can&rsquo;t tie their own shoes without a man&rsquo;s help then they need to be hit by a bus and do the gene pool a favor.</p>  <span style=""font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"">Must Fix It Before The Book Ends Syndrome: Using the last five pages to fix up a relationship that has been through betrayal, and everything else under the sun, is a bad idea. If they are going to work it out it better take more than a few pages of make up sex at the very end.</span>"

"event","Because we all have them our characters should too. I'm assembling a tentative list of some quirks to give my characters to flesh them out more.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Ah, fun times."">Vincent<br />-Seems to always know the time without having to check a watch, and being that he's blind it makes it more fun and probably why he developed the skill.<br />-Enjoys having his left foot hit the top step when climbing stairs and will often readjust on the way up if he determines he will land with his right foot. Even more pleased when he starts with his left foot and ends on his left foot, so odd number of stairs are preferred. <br />-Orders the same meal from a local Chinese restaurant each week. General Tsao's and Moo Moo Gai Pan. <br />-Has the Art of War memorized. Will quote it often even if the situation really doesn't call for it.<br />-Cries to certain songs but will never, ever, let anyone find out about it. Usually plays his cello in private for this very reason.<br /><br />Gabriel<br />-Twirls strands of his hair when bored or nervous.<br />-Likes to talk using sound effects to describe actions and anything else he can come up with a noise for.<br />-Enjoys coffee to the extreme, will sometimes moan with a sip when he thinks no one is around to hear him do it. And sometimes even when he knows they are if it's a good enough brand. Tea will substitute for coffee only if there isn't any of the brew to be had. <br />-Hopelessly oblivious to sexual innuendos and makes them often without realizing it.<br /><br /><br />Warren<br />-Talks with his hands. Wildly. Even when on the phone.<br />-Compulsively checks the dates on coins that he picks up or comes across. Any that have a date that mean something to him (i.e. anniversary date, birth date - rare since he's a werewolf and was born in the 1890's, etc.) he keeps in a separate pocket and saves. Has almost a hundred dollars stashed away in these coins ranging from pennies to silver dollars. Refuses to spend them.<br />-Keeps his military issued revolver in a locked case that is not to be touched, looked at, or opened by anyone. No one in the pack even knows what he keeps in there. <br />-Generally calls people by their last names putting some distance between himself and others, but will correct anyone who calls him by his surname. <br /><br />Ira<br />-Collects Vera Bradley anything. Has to restrain herself when new patterns come out. Will often stop at store fronts and stare at the designs while whoever she is with walks on ahead and loses her. <br />-Will pick up any small rock that she deems appealing. Has her own small rock garden in the pack community lodging made up of assorted pebbles. Often makes Warren carry her trinkets in his pockets. <br />-Cannot stand it when people keep secrets. Will go to any length to make them talk if she believes it is in the best interests of the pack. <br />-Has a ring with an inner movable part that she will twirl absently from time to time.<br /><br />Ilya<br />-Lapses into Russian while talking to himself or thinking aloud without realizing it. Sometimes while talking to other people.<br />-Uncontrollable urge to straighten objects that are off-kilter. <br /><br />Julian<br />-Feels compelled to be sarcastic to everyone he meets.<br />-Determined to kill Warren and become the pack leader someday. Talks often about how he plans to do it.<br />-Exaggerated idea about his own self-importance. <br />-Indulges in sexual innuendos often.</lj-cut><br /><br /><br />"

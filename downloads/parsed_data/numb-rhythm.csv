"event","So I got the results back from my test that I took and I passed!!!!  I worked sooooo hard to pass this test and it happened...its all over...IM DONE!!!  yay!  I mean sure maybe I'll take some classes here and there to better my learning on certain things but I am no longer obligated to take a class....SWEET.  

Anyhow, our last soccer game was last night.  We had to play the best team in the league, and considering that we are the worst team in the league it would be a long night.  But it wasn't that bad, sure we lost but not by much, the score was only 11-9...I kno very high scoring game.  I did awesome, almost ended up with a hat trick but the goalie had a lucky save.

......

...Dude how can you get writer's block on a journal?

So, I guess Dane Cook is tomorrow...that should be a lot of fun, too bad I'm not goin.  Oh well, it doesn't break my heart.  Taking Back Sunday is comin into town soon and I would just love to go see them so I think I'm gonna look into gettin tickets...anybody interested in going?  Prolly gonna be at St. Andrew's.  I'll find out when...oh okay here it is...They are playing with Jimmy Eat World and it's at the State Theatre on April 11, so there ya go, if any of you wanna go with me let me kno.  Doors open at 6 p.m.

So there are a few of you out there that I haven't seen in a while and that sux so we should try to find time to hang out.  I know...the words ""find time"" kinda suck at this point cause it seems like everybody is busy...including myself, just because I dont have school doesnt mean im not busy....it's career time.  Okay well, that's all i needed to say pretty much so everybody have a good day and.....umm......bye?"

I just got home from work a little while ago, and it actually wasn't that bad today, I don't have a problem with anybody that works there, except for maybe Bruce, that boy needs to take a freakin shower, seriously, it has gotten to the point of toxic.  Anywho, went out to Eastern yesterday to go see Amy, which was not planned at all, she asked if i wasnted to come out, as kind of a joke, and I was like ""I got nothin to do here, sure"" So I went out and I was really happy to see her cause I missed her much and hadn't seen her in like meeyuns.  Finally met her roommate, and she ended up bein really cool, I didn't talk to her much cos she had to go do somethin with her sis or whatever but yeah, Amy and I went to Fazoli's to eat which was a lot of fun, and then the fun continued on to the dollar store and we got a bouncy ball maker kit, paint by numbers, and a 3D Picture Maker thing.  Man, who knew the dollar store didn't accept credit cards lol.  So we went back to the dorm to make bouncy balls and whatnot and ended up talkin for a while, which was great and well needed for me...i hope u feel the same way, too.  BTW I hope you are feeling better today.  So anyway, After i left Eastern I got on 94 and i was seriously cruisin at like 100, I was flyin, no cops in sight, I made it to the bowling alley in great time.  And I told everybody that I was the worst bowler of all time and they didnt believe me, so i had to emphasize the fact that i suck at bowling, and I bowled extra horrible, It was fun though, until my mom and I clashed heads for a bit, things are finally starting to cool off between us, which is good.  But that's all I have for now pretty much.  TTYL"

I have been really sick these past couple of days....running about a 103.7 degree temp...yeah it sucked...but hey, im doin good now.  Thanks to the only person that helped take care of me...you kno who you are.  But I was kinda bummed cause i didnt play soccer tonight...i kno i was feelin good but not good enough to run around for an hour and a half straight.  So i had a talk with my good friend Mr. Mattern of the Dearborn Fire department and he suggests that I get a job as a paramedic before I get on a Fire department, I think I might take his advice...I kno that i have come very far but I am only 19 years old and I should take things slow, and jumping on a fire department at 19 is pretty unheard of so  i think I'll slow down and take the experience first....plus if I am a medic first, it will look good on resumes.  Speaking of fire departments, I checked out Scottsdale, Arizona, and their department is hiring 30 guys within the next year and a half so I'm gonna look more into that....I would love to live in Arizona, it would be much better than Michigan.  Other than that, things are goin very well right now, I'm pretty happy, I hope you all are doing good too.  O and by the way, Amy havent heard from you in a while, you still alive?  You said you were gonna call me back the other day and you never did...That made me a sad panda.  Anywho.....I'm off

Just kinda wish i didnt waste the day waiting for a phone call that didnt happen.  Anyways, got a soccer game tonight, hope all goes well....apparently the team that we are playing is really good but we shall see.  So I guess I pissed a certain someone off but I don't really care cause he is being stupid about it.  And if I find out that he is talking shit about me behind my back again, I'm gonna give him something to worry about, that's a promise...if it's one thing I can't stand, it's little punks like him that think they can kick everybodys ass and start talking shit about them.....BEHIND THEIR BACK....you got something to say dude i'm not goin anywhere...pay a visit.  That's all i got to say."

So today is New Years Eve, probly gonna go to Chicago to a party that a friend of mine is having but I dunno if I'll feel like goin, cause there are a few parties around here that should be a lot of fun plus I might have some people come over here, so we'll see what happens.  I'm not too worried about it, I just wanna make sure that I have a spot in the pub tomorrow to watch the Michigan game.  James and I might be goin to the Irish league to watch the game, and that is a great time let me tell you.  So I hope everybody had a good Christmas, mine was pretty good, the family got together and that's always promising, and it was a good time.  This week sucked out loud because of the fact that I had to work all of it, same thing with the week before that, too.  It's all good though I guess because I made meeyuns.  Last night was a lot of fun, I went over Tacos house and he bought DDR for XBOX and he got his whole family hooked on the game.  It was me, Joe, Dan, his dad and mom and his five year old coisin, Paige.  She was the cutest thing I had ever seen.  She did not wanna stop playing.  It was a lot of fun cause I had never really hung out with Joes parents and his brother, we were gonna play pool but I am glad we just hung out there and played DDR and talked.  I just have one more thing to add.....Napoleon Dynamite is the single funniest movie I have ever seen.  It's....amazing....it's incredible."

But enough about that....looks like Scotty got the death penalty, serves him right, he deserves to burn...sorry but i just have something against people who murder their wife who happens to be carrying a baby, they should put him in front of a firing squad, or better yet just give him papercuts till he bleeds to death, ok thats a little colorful lol.  So i finally got all my christmas shopping done, spent a lot of money, and plus i gotta pay for soccer, i am just getting drained...but its ok, the money is not going to waste so thats good, plus i will hopefully be getting christmas money to kinda balance it out, we'll see.  Lets see, what else should i talk about....still no word on Port Huron FD but it's early yet....im just getting really excited about it cause thats where i am most likely gona get a job, and I am very very happy about that.  I am finally feeling good about things now, feeling more confident(geez sounds like a viagra commercial), but yeah im finally feeling how i want to, im not bummed, not lonely, not worried, things are goin great right now....i dont kno how long this will go on for but you can be sure that I am gonna preserve this moment.  Got the fire academy graduation ceremony this weekend on saturday at 7 pm so if any of y'all wanna come see me graduate let me know, i would love to see you there.  But thats about all i got for now and i gotta sleep sometime so.....night."

with the sounds of the ocean crashing 7:30 friday evening 
everything comes tumbling down i choke back each tear that bleeds 
i'd rather rest forever in your arms 
i'd rather stay here than go but i know that 
i should leave as i sit here helpless 
don't go you said you wouldn't you said you couldn't 
i think of our time together is it fading 
am i dreaming everything you said lives on 
i cherish our memories i want to kiss your tears away tonight 
it's hard to give up the one you never thought you'd leave 
don't go your eyes see through my soul 
don't go you say as i walk out your door."

We both act the same, we both conduct our feelings the same way, just toward different people.  I must say, though, your life seems like it can get confusing at times....but you make it that way and besides, tell me who's life doesn't get confusing, it's everywhere, confusion that is.  Sometimes, speaking in riddles is the only way one knows how to communicate with someone.  There are things that I need to say to you but I just can't.  Is it fear?  Well, that seems like the most logical explaination.  I am always prepared to tell you but when i see you it just stays on the tip of my tongue and goes nowhere else.

And, I remember why I don't like seeing my mom in the morning....she has to be the meanest person in the world....every morning!!!  I was like...""Wake Dad up next time!!""  That got her pretty pissed.  Oh well, what r ya gonna do?  Now its like 8:15 and I can't go back to sleep cause I gotta wake up at 9 anyways so I might as well stay up.  It really didn't help the fact that I went to bed at about 3 in the morning so yeah, I have a feeling that today is gonna be a rough day.  First I gotta get tags on my car, then I gotta clean up the house, then later on Im supposed to hang out with Sara, then I guess Im supposed to go to Clutch tonight with Blake, Courtney, James, Ashley, and Kelly.  But I also wanna make it out to the league and get a little tipsy with my fellow Irish, we'll see what happens.  So my mom got a digital picture printer and I hooked it up and it's pretty sweet....but we didn't need a digital picture printer, we need a regular printer, that's a little more important, but o well, I guess she got a good deal on it....she made it sound like she bought it off the black market...hhmmmm.  Ahh crap I just remembered I gotta go to the bank today....MAN so much to do and so little time to do it in.....oh well maybe I just won't clean up the house...I can't do everything..lol yeah then my mom would be REAL pissed...and I don't need to hear her complaining all day...that's just not fun.  OOO yeah and I gotta ask, I wanna start up an indoor soccer team for next season so if there are any of you who wanna play, I don't care how good or bad you are, it's not gonna be competitive, it's just gonna be coed.  I would rather start up a team with a bunch of friends than play on a team with a buch of people i don't kno.  So yeah that's pretty much all I had to say.  Peace"

It's just fun.  Ken finally lost on Jeopardy yesterday...that was just amazing...and he was beat by a GIRL....even better.  Yep a great day in history lol.  I just gotta wonder though....I just don't kno how word gets out like wild fire....i'm sure most of you don't kno what im talkin about and thats okay but I kno some of you kno exactly what Im talkin about.  Things have been hectic in the drama world but I try not to worry about it, and well....i dont try that hard.  Its seems that a lot of people that i kno have been beaten up by relationships and whatnot...well i can tell you that in this day and age....drama and relationships are way overrated.

"event","Nice Guys Finish Last....

How many times have you heard the phrase ""nice guys finish last"" ? You probably can't even count how many times you've heard some frustrated guy say this. You might even say this yourself quite frequently. So, what is it about ""Nice Guys"" that cause their hearts to get stomped on by women and people in general? I'm going to help explain this as clearly as possible.

First, it is NOT the fact that a guy is ""nice"" that makes him unattractive to women. Being nice is a great personality trait and there's nothing wrong with being a nice person. So many men are under the impression that they were ""too nice"" and that's why they got stomped on and stepped over. Wrong !

No more Mr. Nice Guy...

The first and most crucial mistake a guy can make is to lie to himself about the REAL reason that woman got scared off. Most of the time he is just too needy and attempts to build his entire existence and happiness around being with her. Guys...this is TOO MUCH pressure and feels suffocating. Men don't like overly needy women and women don't like overly needy men. So, how do you avoid turning into a clump of belly button lint stuck in some woman's navel? Simple...do NOT build your life around her or anyone else, for that matter. Have your own interests and activities. Build a happy and healthy life for yourself so that when you do find a good woman she compliments the good life you already have rather than creates or completes your life. Every good and quality relationship includes time away from each other and room for each person to be an individual as well as part of a couple.

Nice Guy Syndrome....

Another mistake so many nice guys make is to devote all of their time into doing things for other people to the point where they aren't taking care of themselves. Learn to say no when you need or want to say it. It's okay to put your own needs and wants ahead of doing things for others that they could do for themselves. If you don't take care of yourself first you won't be worth a damn to anyone else. How can you be there for that woman in your life if you don't see to your own needs first? You can't.

Love is a wonderful thing, and it's a precious gift you can give to other people. However, most importantly, you MUST love yourself first. Until you can genuinely love yourself you can't love another person in a healthy way. So many ""nice guys"" mistakenly believe that if they worship the ground a woman walks on and idolizes her that she will automatically return the same treatment towards him. These are what I like to call ""Unrealistic Expectations"". More often than not, these kinds of expectations go unmet and lead to pain, frustration and sometimes anger. These expectations are nothing more than premeditated resentments. This isn't healthy behavior and what it boils down to is a heavy dose of self inflicted suffering. Never set yourself up for this kind of disappointment. Treat yourself better than this.

Finally...if a man spends all of his time catering to the whims of others, how can he find the time to have a full and rich life? He can't, and his life is spent helping others to make their lives more interesting while his life becomes more and more dull and boring. He has little energy left for his own adventures and excitement and his love life suffers as a result. Women don't like boredom and stagnation.

The mistakes nice guys make are

-Being too needy 

-Unrealistic Expectations/Premeditated Resentments 

-Idolizing a woman 

-Living for everyone else but himself and becoming dull 

-Making his happiness and existence too dependent on his relationships with others 


If you recognize your own behavior in this list, you have probably blamed your ""niceness"" for hindering your relationships with women. Hopefully this article will help you to see and understand exactly where the problem is and what you need to do to fix it.

Here are a few things you can start doing right away to help you to stop making this mistakes with women.

-Start saying ""No"" when you don't want to do someone a favor. ""Sorry, I can't"" is just as easy to say, and the world won't stop turning if you say no. 

-Go spend some time with and on yourself...make your life exciting and interesting. Do things you enjoy just because you enjoy it. You deserve this! It's YOUR life! 

-Don't worship women. They are human, make mistakes and aren't perfect. They are just like you for the most part, and are no better or worse than you are. Don't treat them like they deserve more than you do. If you don't respect yourself women won't respect you either. 

You ""need"" food and water. You ""need"" shelter. You don't ""need"" any specific person to create your happiness and make you ""somebody"". If you feel like you ""need"" someone else to be happy then your feelings towards that person are NOT healthy. It's healthy to ""want"" someone to compliment who you ALREADY are, but NOT to ""need"" someone to define or complete you. 


In conclusion ... don't lose the niceness, lose the neediness

I found this on-line and I thought it was quite interesting...especailly at this time...now I am definately not a hypocrite...I have tried to be the nice guy at one point and can tell you firsthand that it does not and will not work...Hopefully this artical will be an eye opener to all of you guys out there who get walked on by women on a daily basis.  I also wanna know what you women out there think about this artical...is it true or is it just another way of guys trying to figure out a girl and be wrong about it?

"event","Finally! &nbsp;I get a call from the sellers of the house saying everything is done.  I let the bank know and they ask me for a purchase agreement, this was on a Monday.  I said OK thats fine and called the seller.  She talked to her lawyer and got back with me saying her lawyer could not provide a purchase agreement.  Ok I can deal with that, I called the bank and relayed the message.  They were a little confused.  I imagine those of you who have gone through something like this know why.  Those of you who don't know why I'll let you know.  You see a purchase agreement is a very standard document.  Just about any lawyer who has dealt with selling a house has a standard copy they like to hand out to their clients.  And I know the seller's lawyer has dealt with selling a house before, he did it twice for my mom.  Anyway, after I told the bank the information they said they could not provide me with a purchase agreement because it would be a conflict of interest.  YAY me!  I just felt like crying.  But I got a silver lining.  My nanny was buying a house at the exact same time as me, she is already living in her house.  The bank knew we were related and told me that the purchase agreement she had was perfect.  So I got off the phone with the bank and called my nanny about the purchase agreement.  

Later that night my nanny came over with her purchase agreement and I scanned it in as a word document and was able to manipulate the document to fit the house I was buying.  The next day after work I was at the seller's house and we were going through the purchase agreement to make sure we were both satisfied with what it said.  She sent it to a lawyer who looked it over and made a few suggestions about how to change it, we made the few changes and sent it back to the lawyer.  By that Friday we were ready for everyone to sign it.  But Oh yet another show stopper.  I get a phone call from the seller at around 3:30 saying that they want the bank to look over the purchase agreement to see if they are satisfied.  I told the seller that the bank was the one that suggested the purchase agreement that we had so I'm sure they would be fine with it.  But the seller insisted that the bank look at it.  This brilliant idea came from the first lawyer that said he couldn't give us a purchase agreement.  This is just great, wanna know why? Cause the bank closes at 3 PM.  I call the bank and no one answers so I leave a message telling them about my dilemma.  I hear nothing from them so I call again on Monday morning.  They said they don't have to look at it, whatever I have is fine as long as both parties are satisfied.  I told the seller and they were satisfied.  The seller then lets everyone that needs to sign the agreement know that they need to come and sign it.  I get the purchase agreement back that Friday all signed.  I was very excited. &nbsp;Monday I did not have work so I went deliver the signed purchase agreement to the bank personally. &nbsp;The bank was happy and started the next step to getting me into hopefully my new house.

Next chapter, the appraisal.

Thank you and have a nice day!"

"event","&nbsp;So the beginning of my own life started around April when I had the thought that I might be able to buy my very own house. &nbsp;I wasn't telling anyone anything because I was not sure if I could actually do it. &nbsp;I had a house picked out and went talk to the bank. &nbsp;They told me everything I needed to get together for the application of a loan. &nbsp;I turned it all in that day and got my reply with-in a week. &nbsp;I was approved! &nbsp;The house was in succession so then I had to wait and wait and wait and wait some more.

By October my loan had expired and I was right back to square one, I knew what house I wanted to buy. &nbsp;The house was just about ready to be sold. &nbsp;I was told that it would be a good time to try and get&nbsp;re-approved&nbsp;for another loan. &nbsp;I did all my paperwork again and got approved once more with-in a week. &nbsp;I then had to wait some more.

More to come.......

Thank you and have a nice day!"

"event","Hilo!,
  So I found out people actually read this.  If I offend anyone in anyway, I'm sorry, I don't mean it.  On with the reason I'm posting again.  I soooo totally made a good grade on a test that I thought I bombed.  I was so upset about it because I studied my ass off for that test.  So next time you see me and I don't have a butt, you'll know why.  I soo totally made an 84 on that test.  I'm soo excited!  Also, if I make a 75 on the final I'll get a B in the class.  I really hope I get a 75 on my final.  I believe I diserve a B, after all the studying I do for this class.  I have never studied so much for one class ever.  I don't think I could combine the two other classes I studied most for and come close to the amount of time I studied for in this class.  
   In other good news, I do not have to go to my 7:30 class anymore.  Today I went to class and my teacher had our grades so far in the class.  If we did nothing else in the class, we will still keep that grade.  So I'm not going anymore because I have my A in the class already.  Granted its only two more classes I don't have to go to, thats two days I get to sleep later instead of waking up at 6:50 am.  Also, in another class I am making a higher grade than I thought.  I thought I was making a low C in one of my classes but really I am making a very low B, like the skin of my teeth low. I am very relieved.  Its a stupid class anyway.  I really do not need it.  It's a CIS class and I am a CIS major, it really will not help me in any way at all, period.  I have talked to CIS majors that are about to graduate and they say they remember nothing and learned nothing and use nothing from that class.  Its useless if you ask me.  But I guess they have to give you bullshit classes that mean nothing to anyone to make you go through a lot of trouble for nothing.
   Crawfish Day was today and I pretty much enjoyed it.  I wasn't to enthusiastic about going until I convinced mt sister to come with me so I could have someone to go with.  My sister rocks and no one could convince me otherwise.  I went ate bland crawfish, people watched, got a cool red crawfish day cup and left.  I think I got a little bit of a tan, which is good since I'm wearing a holter top tomorrow.  That really is my whole crawfish day experience.  I can say though, one memory I will keep is one of the smartest people in my class, a girl, riding the bull.  That was entertaining.  I guess in class when I see her and out of class when I see her I always saw her in a ""lets do school work environment"".  Its really nice to see people soo smart that study all the time, have fun.   It does my heart good.  Well this is me sighing out.  Chow!  Thanks for reading and leave a comment!!!  Thank you and have a nice day!"

  Been a while since I said anything on this thing.  Its not like anyone reads it anyway.  The person who convinced me to get this journal doesn't even talk to me, like ever.  He told me he wanted to read updates about my life.  You can just call me or even talk to me online, its not like he doesn't have my AIM buddy name or my phone number.  Sure he could have lost my number but I know he see's me on his buddy list.  I try talking to him every once in a while and all he does is blow me off, says he's busy.  I don't know why I even bother.  It is depressing to be the only one who tries to keep a friendship together.  Trust me I keep enough friendships together to have my fair share.  I dunno what to do about it.  

   So I told the guy I like that I like him and he said he only likes me as a friend.  I told him that I'd take that, its better than nothing.  I just look at him everyday and think how cute he is and how awesome of a person he is.  Soooo soooo nice, very helpful when you need him to be.  He also rocks very much.  We are best friends.  We see each other everyday, when at school, but if we are not at school then we talk to each other everyday.  I am in heaven being his friend.  We also have three classes together and study almost every chance we get for those classes.  I can't say that I have ever had anyone help me sooo much with my classes, it is the best.  Oh by the way, this is a shout out to you, my SUPER FRIEND!!!! WHAT UP SUPER _____ ?!?!?!

   I also have a friend that is stationed in Iraq, who is in town right now.  He is in town for two weeks and it is great to see him.  He gave me the best massage yesterday I can honestly say I have gotten since I stopped going to my acupuncturist.  I had the best night sleep I have ever in like months!  It was awesome.  

   Well I have to go write a program for my CIS 350 class, good luck me.  I'll try and remember to keep this updated as often as I can remember.  Check ya'll later.  Chow!  Thank you and have a nice day!!"

I rekindled a friendship that was going south but now it is better.  I am surrounded by friends!! I love friends, guy friends.  I can't explain that statement.  I also have a basketball game to play at today!  I love basketball games.  I have so much fun playing the songs we play and with the people I am with.  I went to the movies last night with my Super friend.  We went see Constantine.  It was an awsome movie.  I didn't realize it would be so much of a religious movie, but it was talking about my religion so I didn't mind.  I understood everything that was going on in the movie.  You don't have to be my religion to understand the movie though.  You don't have to be religious at all, they explain everything through out the movie.  I do have to say though, the company was good too.  That could have made it a better movie too.  What am I saying good, the company was great!  I love watching movies with my super friend, we can talk to each other during the movie and my super friend won't tell me to be quiet because their watching the movie.  I love that, I always have comments to make during a movie but never have the right person to tell them to.  Now I have my super friend!  I'm sooo happy.  This here is going to be a shout out to my super friend, HILO! SUPER _____!  Oh well I need to go get my stuff together to go to my basketball game.  This is me signing out, Chow!

"event","Ok so tomorrow is the last day of school before the Mardi Gras holidays.  Many teacher have taken the advantage of this time to give us big homeworks to turn in.  So far I have th take an ethics test for my management class plus a quiz on chapters 1-4, a spreadsheet exercise for my management Information systems class and probably a reading quiz, and an excessive amount of statistics problems to do for my Decision Making Techniques class (statistics).  All of that is all due for Thursday.  I will probably have a program due Friday for my Introduction to Visual Basic.NET class and then I know I will have some problems to do for my Macroeconomics class.  Some holiday I will have!  I have started on my management and statistics work so far.  I still have a shit load to do!  I do plan on going to at least one parade though.  It is a local parade in the town next to where I am from, only like 5 miles though still in the same parish.  This is the parade that everyone in my parish on our side of the river go to.  I really only go to it to see all of my friends I don't get to see during the year because we are all off at school somewhere trying to get an education to succeed in life.  You really only get to see people if you or they are walking the route, most people just stay in one spot because they are to lazy to go find their long lost friends from high school, or they are already by their friends.  

On other news, I got a phone call Tuesday night at around 10:00 pm from my friend Nick.  We went to high school together.  After we graduated Nick joined the Army.  In May of 2003 he was sent to Iraq.  He came back a year later in May of 2004.  While he was stationed in Iraq we wrote each other back and forth.  It took a long time for us to get each others letters because of the traveling time to get to and from Iraq or here.  Anyway, since his return from Iraq we have been keeping in touch by phone.  Well about three months ago or probably even longer he told me that he was volunteering to go back to Iraq.  I was upset because I know how bad it is over there.  I don't want him to get killed or hurt very badly, or even hurt at all.  So my phone call from him Tuesday was the last phone call I will get from him in a year because of the fact that he was leaving for Iraq in 2 hours.  I grew very sad during the whole conversation.  I almost wanted to cry.  I knew that he was leaving that day and was telling people that ""I have a friend leaving for Iraq today.""  I was handleing it well until he called me to say good-bye.  I miss him very much.  I say prayers for him when ever I can.  He is a great friend and I will miss him a great deal but I have to tell myself that he is doing it for a good cause.  I understand why he volunteered to go back, he understands his civic duty to our country and will help the best way he can.  I hope one day that 
I will be able to achieve as much greatness for our country as he has.  

Thank you very much for reading my stuff.  I like when people leave me comments because it lets me know that people care about what I have to say.  Not many people listen to me to much anymore, or even ever.  Well this is me signing out.  Chow!  Thank you and have a nice day!"

"event","Do I have a sign on me that say's ""Walk All Over Me, I Like It""?  I just don't understand some people.  A lot of people actually.  How are you gunna make plans with someone, confirm it like 3 hours in advance and then forget and go do something else with your friends?  And lets not forget, not call the person your supposed to do something with so when they call you and are like ""are you ready?"" your like I kinda forgot and am doing something else with my friends.  That is basically what has been going on with me lately.  I make plans with friends and they forget about something and wind up going do something with their friends.  I mean seriously, I feel like I'm being avoided.  Is their something wrong with me that people feel they need to do this to me?  It happens to often with me that I can't just blow it off.  Plus, its not just one person that does this to me.  Its pretty much all of my friends, well just most.  What is it about me?  I mean I can see it might be that I'm too forgiving or that I understand way more than I should, but I don't know.  I really don't take it well when someone does this to me, not at all.  I start to think of things that I did wrong or things that could be wrong with me.  For my self, I can think of a lot of faults that I have that could cause people to treat me like this.  Choosing one is the problem I have.  I probably shouldn't beat myself up so much about stuff like this.  It just happens a lot you kinda start to wonder why.  Well, peace out homies.

  You know what I don't undarstand?.....I know you don't thats why I'm going to tell you.  I don't understand how a school with a culinary college in it has such sucky cafeteria food.  I mean its Chef John Folse for crying out loud.  It is sad when I have to bring my own container of Tony's seasoning with me because the food is that bland.  That is also sad because this is south Louisiana and we can't provide our students with a container of Tony's?  I also have to bring my own salad dressing.  I only eat three types of salad dressing: Ranch, Cesar, and Thousand Island.  I also like Bacon and Tomato but I havn't seen that dressing around here in forever.  They can never get their ranch correct, it always tastes sour.  They don't always serve thousand island, and when they do serve it it makes me want to gag.  I really don't like our cafeteria here but since I live in the dorm I have to have a meal plan and I'm not going to waste my parents's money.  Well I'm done with that soap box.  Thats enough for me right now.  I have a dinner date with my dad today so I think I need to go do my homework.  Peace out!  Thank you and have a nice day!

"event","So I'm conducting this survey, mostly for guys but for girls I can reword the questions.  This survey deals with sexual things.  It is for my own personal knowledge, and names will not be included.  For the most part their are questions that guys have problems answering and girls have no problem answering.  I would never think that guys are shy when it comes to anything.  Well at least my friends that I am asking.  My friends that are girls have no shame.  My answers however really add nothing to the survey since I am a virgin but they don't all pertain to sex.  They all pertain to sexual things though.  

On the other hand, Gilmore Girls rocks!  I love that tv show.  I laugh soo much just at the types of comments they make.  I'm just ready for Christopher to get the hell out of Dodge.  Lorelai and Luc are soo good together.  I have been waiting 4 years for them to get together and now they have.  I like it!

P.S. If anyone wants to take the survey just let me know.  I'll be glad to ask you my questions, girls and guys.  I don't mind asking either one."

   Have you ever wondered why you can never fall asleep at a decent time when you have to wake up early?  Or when you can wake-up pretty much whatever time you want you go to bed early?  That is my life right now.  Also, do you ever wonder why during the summer people like to freeze you out in their homes and places of business?  And during the winter they like to bake you?  I wonder these things.  I like being comfortable, no extreme's.  I do have this philosophy though, I'd rather sweat my ass off than freeze it off because one it thaws out from being frozen its gunna hurt like a bitch.  Well I'm really tired because last night was one of those late nights.  I'm going take a practice nap.  That way when I need to take a nap I'll have plenty of practice and I'll know what I'm doing.

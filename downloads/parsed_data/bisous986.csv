"event","Fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head

Though I see
The danger there
If there's a chance for me
Then I don't care

Fools rush in
Where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love
So how are they to know?

When we met
I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let
This fool rush in

Oh, open up your heart and let
This fool rush in

Whoa open up your heart and let
This fool rush in"

i liked it...its a little over pricey...but the harbor was absolutely beautiful, and the weather was perfect...im really enjoying the small pleasures in life

"event","hmmm i havent really been posting much lately...i guess there isnt a whole lot to say

ive just been working..sleeping..and occasionally going out

recently i told one of my guys that i just didnt see it workin out with us...and its weird cause now im so used to him callin/textin all the time...and now i sorta miss it

but i told him to stop cause i didnt think i liked him that much...now im wondering if i made a mistake

its weird cause when i end it with someone usually i never look back

but now im lookin back and its only been like 2 days

hmmm...anyway he said he still wants to hang out tmrw...so we shall see

on another note...im trying to get my loans for school...so hopefully everything will work out with that and my move to miami will be a smooth transition...its crazy cause i wont be working for the next 4 yrs....just studying all day/everyday...how odd cause ive always held a job since i turned 16

and its gna be really intense...ive received the syllabus for all of the classes and im already intimidated...i really am looking forward to microbio and immunology and even the dr/patient/society course....but im reallllly scared about anatomy, histology, biochem, and physio...eeeks!

i guess im kinda nervous cause my background is english...i took all the pre-reqs for med school with all the chem/bio classes....but the majority of the classes i took in college were related to literature and writing...this is certainly going to be a steep hill to climb.."

when one area of your life is going well, the other falls spectacularly to pieces...

i got in an argument with one of my aunts...my dads family is always criticizing me about not calling enough/spending enough time with the fam...and im seriously sick of it.

i admit that im not a big phone person...but i do the best i can....i dont take criticism very well so i need a little time to cool off..

ick...but moving along...i just feel so emotionally jaded..

i should feel incredibly lucky cause my new guy jonny is so sweet & amazing...but its like overshadowed by how awful my past guy has been treating me..

im just always hurt by him, and i dont kno why i go back for more

i must be a masochist or something...like drawn to painful relationships...i dont even understand it

i think that i need to learn to let go...ive never had such a hard time getting over someone...i just wonder why me?

this is supposed to be a happy time in my life...im really excited about my future..and i just need to move forward

i do eventually want to be in a happy & successful relationship and eventually marriage..so i need to see guys for what they really are...bad boys really are bad and WONT change..i dont need that in my life anymore."

I got into another school! yay! well technically its a medprep first but a guaranteed spot tho...the first semester is in miami, before taking off for the islands for 2 yrs and the last 2 yrs in clinicals in the US.  It would definitely be a world tour but one well worth it I hope!

I need to make a decision soon b/c I only have 2 weeks before I have to pay the hefty deposit.  EEeeeks...I read the syllabus and Im not gonna lie im very intimidated.  The class structure is serious.  I mean I know its med school and all but the rules are kinda strict.  Attendance is obviously mandatory, tardiness is forbidden, and dont even think about trying to wear jeans to class.  And lets not get started on the content of the classes...it looks like the professors move at lightning speed.  I just hope I can keep up *fingers crossed*

But changing the subject...if i can take off from work, I can go with my dad to Boston for the july 4th weekend yayyy!

...so we shall see...

today has been a very good day...thank you God!"

When we first met I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped in one with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shock that spun me around
And now my heart's dead
I feel so empty and hollow

And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame
And now I feel like....oh!

You're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
Should've never let you enter my door

Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed

It's like I checked into rehab
And baby, you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
And baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby you're my disease

Damn, ain't it crazy when you're loveswept (?)
You'd do anything for the one you love
'Cause anytime that you needed me I'd be there
It's like you were my favorite drug
The only problem is that you was using me
In a different way than I was using you
But now that I know it's not meant to be
I gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you"

lol

so lets start with lee..
intro (we met so randomly, in a parking lot lol)

purpose (i get the feeling he wants a gf, but im not sure if thats specifically me or if he just wants one in general)

hypothesis (i predict that we'll talk for a few weeks before we come to some sort of crossroads...i doubt it'll be a hook up thing...hes slightly intense so it'll either be a dating thing or just a friendship)

procedure(hmm hes very consistent with the calling...he called before, during, after my ft lauderdale trip, hes slightly jealous when i talk about other guys, ive cancelled 2 dates w/ him and he kept his cool, we've met up for starbucks & another time at the mall...so far sooo good)

observation (same as above)

conclusion (will come back to this one in a few weeks and see where we're at)"

its so strange to have a low tolerance cause before that little amount of alcohol would never phase me and now its more than enough to get me drunk

and of course i got a little emotional...hence the 'poor me' post below :)

haha

and i got really emotional about my guy situation...i was like pouring my heart out to phyl about the way i feel about the guys ive talked to/dated in the past....she was probably like overwhelmed lol

and omg i was kinda bored with my date so i started like drawing chemical structures on the napkins at the bar...i was like texting other guys...eww im so rude...im not normally like that but i was just drunk..

haha it was kind of fun tho...but got a little emotional at the end....im so weird."

"event","But something happened
For the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking 'round
Thinking I'm going crazy

Oooh, yahhh

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth

i dont think im gonna get in


i wish i could be more optimistic. but i dont think its gonna happen


my undergrad grades werent that great.  damn i wish i could do it all over again.  unless i miraculously scored well on the mcat, i just dont know if i can pull it off.

the admissions committee would just have to be in one hell of a nice mood to accept me.

eww i need to work on my self esteem :(

"event","so time is definitely flying by...its like the middle of february already...damn

just came back from the movies, i saw ""slumdog millionaire"", it really blew me away....amazing movie, truly

but back to the craziness...finished my orgo test, now gotta do some physics homework, take the exam and write the labs...............blahhhh i dont wanna do itttt!


its just an endless cycle. work. class. homework. labs. shadowing. test. applications. more class. more work. family time. 

wheres the ME time????

i feel like today was the first time i got to be a human being, and got a chance to go relax and watch a movie....but i have this looming fear that i should still be doing work for my classes...or be productive in some other way


im such a worrier. and a complainer. i really need to change that about myself. its a serious neurosis....and eww where did it come from because i used to be so laid back! 

ayy...i guess the adult world is not agreeing with me :(

my friends called me to go out for sushi and drinks on saturday...i agreed as long as i got a chance to finish my phys homework...damn my life always takes a backseat to my work but i guess i just have to keep this up til may 11th then ill be freeeeeeee!

well for a little bit at least :-)"

"event","i was just thinkin about the past and all...and i've realized something


in all my four years of college, i never met a single guy who was really worth dating..


i dont keep in touch with ANY of them, unless we were just friends...wow

i guess part of it is my own fault, because i probably didn't portray myself well, in the 'girlfriend' light or whatever....but mostly i was just figuring out who i am...it was my first time being on my own, with any kind of freedom, free of pressure from family to behave a certain way

but still, four years and nothing?

i dated a little here and there, but none of em were worth it

i met some good friends though, and i wouldn't trade my experiences for the world...now i don't plan to get serious or anything because i think that certain things are out of one's control, but i do want to put myself forward as more of an adult...because i truly do feel that im finally growing up...becoming the person i've wanted to be

focusing/planning my future...being self confident about what i have to offer (and not in the physical sense)

im happy now, but i still have a lot to work on.....i guess i won't ramble anymore, i should study some chem before i fall asleep :-P"

"event","i just got a call from I.A.T.S.E Local 500 (a techie union here in palm beach county), because they want me to send a copy of my drivers license, S.S. card, and vehicle registration to their office. this can only be a good sign!

last night was hell. i had the worst migraine ive had in a long time. it was so bad when i got to work i threw up. a went home around 8.30 (i was supposed to stay till 11.30) and went online (despite protests from a certain loving someone who just wanted me to go to bed). i got to bed around 10.30 or so. and woke up around 7.30... my headache was gone this morning but i felt it coming back around 10, so i took some exedrin(sp?) migrane and im hoping it will go away... it's not as bad as it was last night. i think it's my eyes that are doing it. i am going to get my eyes checked on thursday, so hopefully ill have my new contacts by tuesday morning. 

speaking of tuesday... i cant WAIT for this vacation. i have a feeling that im going to be working a lot when i get back, so i am going to savor every moment... plus i get will alone in a hotel room for four days... hoo-rah!!!

anyway... im off... my cousin is down and this is the last day in going to be able to hang out with her before she goes back up to NY. 

catch you cats on the flip-side!"

will and i are planning a trip to tampa in too weeks (spring break) i cant wait to get the hell outa here... i have the hotel and tix for the park booked... we're staying for 3 nights, and still have yet to decide what we are going to do on the second day of our stay... i hope we figure it out soon... 

as for work... the antique show is over, i got paid WELL! and now im looking into other jobs... im going to see if i cant find something set-wise... barnes & noble still sucks, but i get discounts, which is really all i care about. 

the statement for my loans came in... horray (note the sarcasm)... it says my first payment is due in may, but my mom said i had one due in march so she's going to figure it out and go over it all with me so i understand the papers... i tried to read them... i <i> really </i> tried... it just made no sense to me... 

within the past two weeks i have discovered that i am numerically dyslexic... im okay with words... never had a problem with them... but when it comes to numbers i just cant even read them... it's like my mind shuts down...

it kind of sucks being so right brained all the time. for ONCE i would like to be logical... just ONCE i would like to look at equations and NOT have an anxiety attack...

i guess everyone wants what they cant have...

okay... signing off now..."

"event","yesterday was my valentines day... and boy was it a valentines day! (yes, william... i am gushing, just like you wanted, lmao). i got up around 11.00 and got ready and stuff. will picked me up around noon and took me to the origioan pancake house (the first place we went on a date, how TOTALLY romantic).  

then he took me to morikami. it was a little hot, but otherwise beautiful outside... we sat by one of the zen rock gardens at one point and he kissed me *smile*... it was totally sweet... we complained a bit because i wanted to go into one of the museam parts and he didnt want to take of his shoes... but he did anyway... 

after that we went back to his house and chilled out... i fell asleep for a little bit (well, half-sleep) and then we watched tv... okay... we KIND OF watched tv, heehee...

after that we went up to city place and went to dinner at the cheesecake factory (he let me pay, because i was badgering him to... i also was able to grab the check before he was, haha!!). we were going to go to a movie after that, but we were both pretty tired, so he took me home... all in all, the day was perfect...

as for presents, he got me two HUGE boxes of chocolate (yay! chocolate!), a wolf statue that i really wanted (it's in a collection, and i want to get ALL of them, lmao!), a fake rose (that way i can keep it forever), a dvd (serenity!!!!!!!!! *dances like a crazy person* shiny!!!), a stuffed v-day dog (so fuzzy!), and chopsticks and a chopstick holder he bought me at morikami (they're red and gold! just like gryffindor!!!)... he loves me and i love him!!! o! he also got me a card with a bever on it that says ""dam you're hot""... it was clever...

i got him a really pretty sword and the three amigos dvd, and a card, too...

i love not being depressed on v-day... anyway, 

i have to go... grandpa's making pasta and i have to eat before i have to go to work later... bai now!"

i thought that was kinda cool, and kinda true. 

i am chillin at home right now. i dont have to be at B&N until 4, so i think ill leave around 3.15 and get there early.

i had strawberries and vanilla ice cream earlier. yum! mommy brought the fresh strawberries home yesterday and i normally dont like strawberries, but these were REALLY good!!

i also have to call the film commission and tell them im still interested in the internship. hopefully after they review my info and stuff they will call me and say ""we like you! come join our ranks!"" that would rock. 

ive been debating whether or not to call james and ask how his week with erica went. but i think ill wait, because i dont know when the chickie leaves. i dont want to ""interrupt"" anything. *shudder*

so yeah, i go in friday to get trained and it's then that i get my schedule and stuff as well. 

i had to deal all week without even TALKING to will, but now he's back and i am happy. he says he has something planned for us to do today, but last time he said that he didnt. i guess he just wanted me to get my hopes up, lmao. 

so i just got up and now im just chillin online checking e-mails and stuff. so i figured id update. 

savannah sent me an e-mail asking me if will and i wanted to do something with her and darryll later. i still have to check. once i see (or talk to, because that will probably come first) william, im going to. 

still havnt gotten my modem fixed. but mom has to call bell south anyway, so i dont have to call them. and i DID NOT FORGET to call them yesterday. my mother told me in the morning that she was going to call them because she wants to get rid of our land line and still keep our DSL.

will went on a cruise with his fam for the week and it's driving me nuts that i cant even talk to him, but he'll be back on jan 1 so i just have to wait a few more days. 

went to the beach today, it was REALLY nice and i probably would have stayed longer if id thought to being a sweat shirt. it got cold once the sun started to set. but it was a beautiful day.

Tonight Will is coming over for x-mas eve stuff and presents. im making Wassel (mulled cider... it's a norse thing) but i cant start that till later because you have to drink it hot. it's really good though... and i dont even like cider. 

so... yeah... waiting for Tanica... yep... 

Last night i stopped by Jono's party which was fun, got to see him and mike and richard and phillip and paulie and some people i didnt know which was cool. the ferrin's didnt come because they are punks, so doom on them. but all is good. 

went over will's house afterwards and watched a few eps of HOUSE. he got the first season on DVD so it was cool. im really getting into the show, much to my dismay, because i HATE hospital shows... but Dr. House is cool... i like it when he makes fun of stupid people. 

Going to head over to SAVA's house tomorrow to give her her xmas present. and im hoping that jamus will come down so i can give him his. it's all wrapped and sitting under the tree and junk... but he's not here to get it... *sniff*

still waiting for the call... *le sigh* 

I think im going to go over to addictinggames or newgrounds or something to pass the time.

that's right ladies and gents, i made it home alive. i spent all yesterday making my room mine and it looks shibby cool. i also did some of the house work for my mom. 

me and will have been spending some good time together which rox. he got me the first season of hercules: the legendary journeys and we've been watching it. he's going on a cruise in 2 weeks and i wont be able to see him for a WHOLE WEEK! *sob* (gods im a loser, lol)

today im going to take a ride over to the library and see about getting a job there. it will be good because (hopefully) they remember me from when i used to volunteer there. i reall want to work circulation (checking things in and out) if i have a choice, but it wouldnt matter to me either way. i could do anything. i know the inner working of that library. which is a REALLY good advantage.

i might call savannah and see if she wants to go with me so i dont have to go alone. plus i miss her. i havne seen her in, like, FOREVER. so itll be good to get some hang out time. maybe she'll even stay for dinner. 

my mom is leaving tomorrow for her birthday vacay. so sean and i are planning on cleaning up the garden in the back for her. it's a mess. all over grown and screwy because of the hurricanes. so maybe it'll be a nice birthday surprise. i was hoping i would have a job by now so i would be able to get some new flowers and stuff back in there, but it dosnt look like ill be able to afford to do that. 

if anyone wants to come over and help out with the fixing of the garden *ahemcoughwillandsavannahahemcough* it would be greatly appreciated (probably would even count for a yule present for me). 

anyway... im going to go call savannah and take a shower and stuff so i can get my happy ass to the lib.

my not feeling well could also possible be attributed to stress. i know what you're saying... ""how could SHE possibly be stressed? she dosnt have a job, she's not dealing with school... what does she have to be stressed about?"" well... i stress about everything... and this moving thing's not helping me... ugh...

i still have packing to do, and i have to put rain X on my car so ill be able to see out of my windsheild if it starts raining again. i LOVE that stuff, but once it starts wearing off the water (instead of rolling off like it's supposed to) actually sticks to the glass... so ive been driving through pouring rain for the past few days not being able to see out my windsheild... fun...

so yes, i am moving back home on saturday... will is coming up to help me move... cant wait to see him... he's such a sweetheart for helping me... yay...

let's see... what else... hmmm... oh! i (ovbiously) have to quite my job... im going to wait until thursday and then tell them i have a sudden family emergency and have to move home... this way i have a paycheck (not much, but it'll help me get things together once i get back down there...

i have a few options once i move as to where to work... my goal is to get my own place within a year... mom is going to write up and contract for me and her when i get down there... that's right ladies and gentelmen... i no longer have a mother... i have a landlady... that just happens to have changed my dipers at one point in time... *shudder*... 

i actually look forward to moving back home, so yeah...

okay... im REALLY awake right now, even though it's 12.19 in the am... i doubt im going to be able to sleep because im OCD... and im missing a vital part of my getting ready for bed routine... *sigh* im not going to be able to sleep AT ALL... oh well... i dont know if im working tomorrow... so if i am im just going to have to drag my happy ass into work on no sleep... i will be SO glad to quit this job... 

desk jobs are starting to sound REALLY appealing... that way i dont have to deal with people all that much... i used to be a social butterfly and stuff... but as time goes on, i hate people more and more... im becoming totally antisocial...maybe ill wind up as a hermit like savannah... i can live in the cave in the side of the mountain next to her and once a year we can scream hi to eachother... that would be our degree of human interaction... after all, humans are social interaction, dontcha know?

okay.......... nothing else to say..... hmmmmm..... taking up space.... taking up space..... 

oh! will went to a bar mitsvah (sp?) today, so that's why im missing my nightly routine... he probably got home and went straight to bed... he needed to... he has exams tomorrow... he was studying most of the afternoon, so i know he'll do well in both his exams... i probably wont be able to talk to him tomorrow either, because he's got to study for his other exams coming up after he takes calc and spanish final... oy... meesa glad i went to a tech school...

okay... NOW i have nothing to say... but im sure if i lay here long enough typing nonsense that something will come to me eventually... maybe ill update in a few hours... ill probably still be awake... im going to go before this entry takes up peoples ENTIRE friends page...

i starty work on monday morning (more of a training day as i figure it. i have to call the library about the job that i applied for there. if i can get that job im going to take it. the pay is MUCH better and i love working in libraries (ive been doing it for a LONG time)...

miss my love terribly... im waiting for him to get done furniture shopping with his mom and grandparents so he can call me. hopefully he'll get a bed he can actually FIT on... the one he's using right now is WAY too small for him... which is REALLY not good for his back... hopefully he wont forget about me and just go to bed or something when he gets back...

nothing really else to report... saw a beautiful sunset today while i was out driving... was lilac and salmon and periwinkle and all those other colors with funny names... but the way the clouds were lightly strewn across the sky was incredible... kinda made me feel lonely... 

okay... bye everyone!"

im home for the week (at least until friday) and im having a great time. me and will are hanging out a lot which is good seeing as how i never get to see him. we've gone out to dinner the past two nights (since ive been home) and he's taking me out again! what a freak! why would ANYONE want to squander THAT MUCH money on little ol' me? 

... because they are insane, that's why...

we went to the beach last night. and, (bove will appreciate this) there were bioluminecent plankton/algae/whatever EVERYWHERE... it looked like little glowing stars were washing up on the sand when the waves came in... it was damn cool. 

hmmm... what else... o! im going to see harry potter tonight. I feel kinda bad dragging will with me, because i know he really dosnt like harry potter and all... but he says it's okay... *sigh* the things he does for me... 

okay... gonna go now... ill be back in O-Town on friday so i can turn in the proper stuff for starting my job next week."

yesterday went relativley well... i must have filled out 20 or so applications and gave out 4 or 5 resumes... so yeah... 

when i got home my legs and back were KILLING me... i took a bubble bath last night to ease some of the tension... 

im not sure if im going to take it easy or not today... i might go down to universal (call first of course), because they're having a job fair of some sort, and rumor has it they're hard up for techs... but i dunno if i want to work for a big corperation... we shall see...

talked to my hun for a long time on the phone last night... i cant wait to see him... depending on whether or not i get a job, i may not be able to come home for thanksgiving like i'd planned... and that would suck... really suck... because im going insane, lol...

i really miss my sister and i hope that i have off next week so i can see her on the way to my house (or maybe while im at home if she goes back to her house for the holiday). i have something for her that i got at FPG... it's nothing special, but i thought she might like it...

okay... im going to veg about for a while until will calls me around 10... bye now!

im planning of driving over to I-Drive (international drive) and pounding the pavement beggind for work today... im going to see if tanica wants to come witn... 

had a rather eventful night last night... sometimes emotions suck, but thery're alway's there right when you need them... right when you're feeling lost and numb and you havn't felt anything in a while... there are only certain times i feel much of anything anymore but they are the best... even with tears streaming down my face... feeling is never fully appreciated until you just start to go through the motions... you shiver but you dont feel the cold... you laugh but you're not truly happy... but i await those times when i do feel... i await the one thing that can make me feel... and let me tell you... it's worth the wait...

in any case... im going to go and see if i cant start the job hunt early... early bird gets the worm, you know... but i dont like worms... in fact i never really liked that expression... couldnt it be ""early bird gets the tuna sandwich""? that would be so much better than some crummy worm..."

thanks to a man named Kerr im now no longet going to let myself be a victim... i am a warrior and i wont stand for it...

i bought a few things there... i got 2 bottles of mead (chocolate strawberry and ginger peach... the latter is my fave), a green man ornament, and presents for my mom, will, sava, and tanica... so it was cool...

mike said something really true about FPG ""it's great to go, but by the time it's over, you're ready for it to be over""... he's not kidding... i got home, we unloaded the cars and i went straight to sleep for a few hours, didnt even unpack yet... i almost fell asleep driving back...

im thinking of getting up and taking a shower soon though... mmmm... warm showers... the showers at the campsite were FREEZING!!

well... ive only been here a few days and i want to go home... i have pink eye so i have to wear my glasses for the rest of the trip... which means, so much for hiking... i can't see with my glasses... 

i didnt have much fun at the wedding because i miss someone terribly and i hated all the love stuff... it made me lonely... he was busy so i couldnt really talk to him all that much that night... but that's okay... i was being annoying anyway by texting him every five minutes ( ;P  i know he hates it when i say that, lol...) 

went to my little cousin's birthday party... she was turning 2... SOOOO many small children... will suggested i set them on fire... i told him i feel bad for whoever he marries because she will have to deal with traumatized children... they're going to grow up with complexes... lol

okay... my house is still without power... i got to go over to will's house and charge my cell... we're finally at the airport and it took me FOREVER to get online... but i am here. 

the house didnt take too much damage, probably the combined effort of my casting a protective barrier around the ppoperty and sheer dumb luck. we had some screen damage on the porch and one of our trees fell over but that's really it. 

um..... other that that not really anything else to report... had a great weekend... got to catch up with will... hang out and stuff... you know the deal...

in any case... it looks like i may not get a job until after FPG... it's kind of frustrating because i have mom on by back about it the whole time, but it's smart to wait i think. I am still hoiping to work for Cinnabar. 

Mom is being unreasonable about something i really need her to do for me... it's not even something difficult, all i want is a phone number. apparently that's too much to ask. If you dont know what im talking about message/e-mail me and ill tell you, i dont feel like typing it out right now. Let's see, what else... 

Im finishing my second degree soon... i have a few more classes and then my checklist and it'll be over. woo-hoo... it's gone by REALLY fast... it's crazy... 

I need to start working out... im thinking of starting to go to the gym here in the complex a few times a week... i have to set up a schedule for myself. Also now, thanks to bill and nancy, im starting to eat real food on a regular basis, so im sure that'll help me get my health under control. 

it's so weird bing out of school. i drove by Full Sail today and it was such a weird feeling. The realization that i just drove right by it and i didnt have to go in... it was crazy. I am still going to be taking advantage of the facilities, though. I am going to ask the photographry teacher if i can borrow a camera for when i go up north to my cousin's wedding. I have to get his e-mail so i can ask him... i guess ill have to call Tanica...

I was cleaning my room today and i found Sava's textbook. If you can wait a week and a half, i can bring it down to you, babe. is that okay? i just had to type this here, otherwise i would forget, lol. 

37 days till Goblet of Fire!!! i can't wait... i need my sevvie fix... ive seen a clip of mad-eye moody turning draco into a ferret and it was hilarious!!! i can't wait...

i had an interview at cinnabar and that went really well... i would love to work for them because when i got a tour of the workshop i was blown away. I also called disney about the potential carpentry job there and the guy seemed about ready to hire me right over the phone, so i hope that's a good sign. i also have a potential lead working at PI with the audio techs. im willing to do just about anything right now... but cinnabar is really at the top of my list just because of the stuff that ive seen them do.

graduation was cool, it was long and boring, but cool... i was kind of disappointed that i didnt get the Course Director's award for Set Design. But it was given to a person who really deserved it. Pat. He had to figure out a wat to get puppets into the set, so i understand why. 

okay... now for a quiz i picked up from will's journal...



What if you had super powers? I would be able to shapeshift into any animal i touch, like the animorphs...

What if you were stuck on an island? I would relax until i could get rescued...

What if you were famous? it would be wonderful, i could make savannah famous and then she could live up to her potential as the second coming of the messiah...

What if you won the lottery? i would pay off my loans and then take bove and move to australia so we could work with dangerous animals...

What if somebody loved you? people do love me!!!

What if you were the last person on earth? i would be very sad...

What if your friends all disappeared? i would probably be dead...

What if you could do one illegal thing and never get caught? steal the pope's hat and hold it for ransom...

What if you woke up ten years in the future? i would have to catch up on the past 10 years, wouldnt i?...

What if you could go back in time? i would go back to either ancient greece or egypt, so i could learn their magick...

What if you owned a major corporation? i would sell it... i dont want to be the person in charge...

What if you found out I had a crush on you? i would say, i love you, man... but i cant date someone that isnt pagan... i just refuse...

What if you were poor? um... i am...

What if the world was going to end tomorrow? i would gather a bunch of friends and go to the most beautiful place i could think of and just watch the end come...

What if the comic books came to life? it would be soooooo cool, because then i could find kurt wagner and marry him...

What if you could take back something you've done? i wouldnt... because everything ive done has made me what i am today..."

"event","okay... update time

had a nervous breakdown of sorts last night thanx to my bi-polar. but im okay not... im sort of in one of my apathetic moods... i think. In any case. 
it was concerning my cat and how even though ive been trying to get her to like me since i got her in november she still attacks me for no good reason... oy... funny how the littlest things set you off when you're in a low, huh?

job-wise... im still without. apparently ASI only accepts freelance work. I sent out 4 resume's and filled out 2 applications last thursday, though. hopefully that will help. 3 of the resumes were to places that build sets for tv shows and stages and stuff. the last one was to a photography studio that does some realy nice work. im not too confident about that one though. as for the applications... one was to a place called ""black market mineral"" they sell stone beads and other earthy stuff. the other was to SciFi City, a local comic and gaming store that rox!

speaking of gaming, ive been getting into this game called Munchkin. It's a card game and is so totally wicked. you can have weapons like ""a big heavy rock"" and turn a monster into a parrot and everything! it's so awesome! i recommend it to everyone. 

nothing really else going on. im trying to figure out how i can lose 30lbs before november. any ideas besides starving myself?

okay... all done here... bye..."

"event","well, i found out what time they start mowing/doing lawn maintenence in the morning. Around 7:30am. Not because I was curious, but because i was awake. And not by choice. I couldnt sleep. at all. I went to bed relativly early so i could get up in the morning, but that didnt help. i was really tired, but all of a sudden, an hour and a half after i lay down, my brain decided to be awake. So i got out of bed and made some tea so that i could relax. After the tea I watched a couple episodes of clarissa explains it all and tried to go to sleep again. No use. I tossed and turned all night. It sucked.

Anyway, in other news. I still havn't heard back yet from ASI, but im going to give them a call before i leave for class this morning. Because, since im awake now i might as well just go take a shower and get ready. I made my appointment to get my licence yesterday morning for the 13th of september. I'm kind of nervous, but randy has been helping me alot. I drive his car practically every day, lol. 

Apparently there is this lady from this church that needs help setting up some stuff for their new facility. Im thinking of going. I dont think it'a a church so much as a cult. I'll have to get Guardian Bob check it out for me. But i think they are going to pay well because they have LOADS of cash, lol. So maybe ill work for them, get paid, and then call them out as a cult, lol. I would love to see them try to ""convert"" me... lol that would be awesome!

I cleaned my whole apartment. *gasp* yes people Michi actually CLEANED. WILLINGLY. I figure i sould start now, considering ill be moving in a little less than a month. I even vacuumed. crazy huh? and you'll never guess what i found! there is a floor in my apartment. it's baffling. A great man once said, most people think the floor is a way of transporting yourself from one room to another, when in reality, it's the biggest shelf in your house. Well, this shelf is cleaned and organized. woot!

Graduation is just around the bend and im getting kind of worried. I dont have a job yet, and I am having doubts as to whether i really want to be in film. Ive been getting into photography alot recently, so i think ill apply to a few photo studios in the area. I'll have to talk to my ohoto professor so i can get some names and phone numbers in the area. Im also getting photoshop soon, and once i start working im going to see about saving up for a high end digital camera. Not one of those $100 dinky ones. a PROFESSIONAL one. even if it's for my own enjoyment. 

I am currently sleep-deprived dizzy... it sux... lol

I still have to take hecate to the vet. once i have some money i will do that. It should only cost around $25 to get her spayed. then she wont be as miserable. 

There is a guy that i heard was looking for someone to edit his porno. Im not that good at editing, but porn isn't exaclty difficult. So im thinking of calling him. My only worry is that he needs someone who has their own software and i havn't d/l'd final cut yet. The guys in my class are so immature. they are laughing and were like ""i wouldnt do it, would you do it?"" ""naw man... never"" and im like, what the fuck? it's just a porn! you WATCH porn. what difference would it make if you edited the damn thing? plus, the guy is paying $300 a day. that's not pocket change hunny! *rolls eyes* it's not like it's a snuff film... jeeze...

okay, sorry for the long post, i just havnt updated in a while, so i figured i'd give you the D-L, ya know... the 411... yeah... whatever... bye!"

"event","have you ever just had one of those life-affirming days? a day where you just look back on the happenings and realize, ""this is what i want to do for the rest of my life""? today was one of those days. we were shooting on location and i had such a fun time. yeasterday i was a little disheartened because i wasnt doing anything for most of the day and i felt useless. but today i took care of ""crafty"" (in otherwords the food and drinks and stuff) and i was busy most of the day. i had a blast!!! and i realized... I WANT TO MAKE MOVIES!!! whether it's behind the camera or over at crafty, i just want to be involved with this stuff!!! it was so amazing!!! i havn't stopped smiling all day.

i mean, sure, it's hot and exhausting and you feel like your legs are going to fall off by the end of the day, but HELL!!! it's so gratifying at the end of the day. i'm fucking giddy!!! im so excited about tomorrow, and i can wait till the end result. 

in any case, i just wanted to post that... bye now!!!"

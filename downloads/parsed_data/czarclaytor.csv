"event","""Dearest brown-haired bespectacled male junior kinesiology major who lives in Haines, 

When I see you at the coffee cart, or strutting through the quad with all your IV friends, I begin to salivate and squeeze my thighs together with desire. I wish to be your fruit of temptation. I will cover you with love when next I see you, with caresses, with ecstasy. I want to gorge you with all the joys of the flesh, so that you faint and die a dramatic death. When you to recall our hours together, and I want your dry bones to quiver with joy. I lust after the scent that trails behind you as you walk past, and I imagine that it clings to my clothes for hours, seeping out of the fabric to give me little whiffs of exultation. I fantasize about us engaging in the rhythmic pulses of sweet coitus in the very halls where you study to become a doctor. On the laboratory table we will feel the flow of oxytocin and be forever bonded through chemistry. My last wish is one of your valiant sperm shall prevail in his quest to unite with my awaiting egg, thus giving rise to the beautiful new life that will tie you forever to me. 

And so, my beautiful science prince, I await the day when you notice me staring after you with lustful eyes and waiting thighs, so that you can fulfill my every fantasy."""

"event","""the zombie apocalypse has already begun and the zombies aren't even the instinctual flesh eating kind, they feed on ignorance and are severed from the unconscious intuitive drives that guide us in all aspects of life. They are not severed completely, but through meditation, prayer, attention to dreams and ""coincidences"", and intentional right living without some form of a computer in their faces, can be brought back to life. Today is a reminder to awaken. Humans have holidays because without them we are prone to forget the sacred, the set apart, the not for profit, truth that gives our lives meaning and abundance. Don't decay. Do not leave your vitality unattended. Awaken to Ruah! Spirit Breath. Life Blood. You are more than a body, you have a soul to feed. Whether you believe that Jesus is the Christ or not, seek truth and manifest love. open yourself up to transformation, and you will be transformed. Your strong will has divine power to bring about opportunity. we are vessels of divinity! Seek peace and pursue PeaceDreams."" ~ Wisdom from Rachel Mathews"

"event","""Ok bear with me--I'm going to get a little bit scientific on you. Only 10% of human communication is expressed through words. If you really want to be ""sweet"", and maybe even turn her on a little, this might do the trick.

Before you say goodbye to her, put your hands on her shoulders and look at her for a couple of seconds without saying anything. This lets her know you're thinking of her, and that you care about her.

When she says ""What?"", which she will when she notices that you're staring, say, ""Oh, um nothing"" (Girls already know that this is boy language for 'you're really hot'). Then right before she has to go, lean close enough to her that you're nose is literally poking through her hair near her ear and say ""Good night"" soft enough to be sweet, but deeply enough to not sound like a weakling. Talk in that raspy, deep, male voice that turns us on so much.

She won't be able to sleep. (:

I met you on Friday night on Bourbon Street- possibly at Saints & Sinners. I think you had blue eyes & maybe Blonde hair? You tried to help me find my hotel but I took you to the wrong Marriot so I think we took a cab to your place Uptown. Your friend showed up at your house early in the morning after he spent the night passed out in front of CVS. He was from the same place as me in California. When I left I found your other lost friend sleeping in his car and told him to go inside. You mentioned something about cruising the Casual Ads & responding so I am posting here just in case you might see it.
 
I was still drunk when I left in the morning so I didn't really say good bye plus we were wasted the night before and you were probably as blacked out as me but I wanted to tell you about something I just found. I hope you will respond & aren't weirded out about my crazy way to attempt to contact you.
 
Put what you do for a living or your age or your friend's names in the subject line or email because that seems to be the only thing I remember. All of that but I don't even remember your name. Gotta love New Orleans. It's like Vegas & TJ on crack. Really hope to hear from you."""

STRAY birds if summer come to my window to sing and flyaway. 
And yellow leaves if autumn, which have no songs, flutter and fall 
there with a sigh.



*
O TROUPE if little vagrants if the world, leave your footprints in 
my w'ords.



*
THE world puts qff its mask if vastness to its lover. It becomes small
as one song, as one kiss if the eternal. 
 


*
IT the tears if the earth that keep her smiles in bloom. 
 


*
HER wisiful face haunts my dreams like the rain at night. 
 


*
ONCE we dreamt that we were strangers. We wake up to find that 
we were dear to each other. 
 


*
SORROW is hushed into peace in my heart like the evening among the silent trees.

SOME unseen fingers, like idle breeze, are playing Upon my heart the muse of the ripples.

WHAT language is thine, 0 sea?' 'The language if eternal question.' 'What language is thy answer, 0 sky?' 'The language if eternal silence.

LISTEN, my heart, to the whispers of the world with which it makes love to you.

THE mystery if creation is like the darkness if night - it is great. 
Delusions if knowledge are like the fog if the morning.

DO not seat your love upon a precipice because it is high.

I SIT at my window this morning where the world like a passer-by stops for a moment, 
nods to me and goes.

THESE little thoughts are the rustle of leaves; they have their Whisper of joy 
in my mind.

"event","i had collected the scattered pill of unknown origin and decided to group them into piles of similar shapes and so on and so forth. I can be contrived like that, you know, a clean freak when I want to be.

most people have heard of aliens and ufos and maybe have even thought about what they would do if they crash landed in their backyard or somewhere in the mountains where they're on a hiking trip to get away from the city's shitty environment they will return to help generate more shit.

However, Not many people stop to consider what kind of amazing drugs said aliens may have aboard their craft. 

Think about it, no DEA stops or check points for those starfuckers, they can just zoom right in, hoped up on whatever they damn well please.

As for me, I expect such things from beings who take to interstellar voyeurism. Now I held the multi-colored fun facts in my hands and my mouth or mind had begun to salivate before I could even comprehend that I had probably taken two or three or so.

Hmmm...well, I best arrange the rest so as to protect the Earth from these unknown substances. I felt humbly assured in my capacity as the First Responder Quality Insurance Agent of Earth. I didn't expect these ET's to be runnin' on some bunk shit, but you never know til you blow. Or Pop. I just pop'd, but come to thing of it, there probably is some freaky-ass way you need to consume these capsules to get you flying just right.

Fuck...freaky-ass indeed.

I turned the charred slabs of aqua-green flesh over and sure enough, yep, their buttholes were definitely the receptacles for these Thrills.

I looked around. I knew no one was watching me, but this seems to be requisite and innate protocol before stuffing suppositories of unknown and hopefully hideously hallucinogenic properties into one's bum.

If I had pants I would have dropped them, but this is the genius of the man-kilt. Originally the man-kilt was just known as a kilt, but since bastards have a way of fucking up shit for everybody everywhere, no matter how cool their culture is, this happened. However, since I'm 1/16th scottish I have every right to wear the man-kilt and call it simply a kilt. Regrettably, I do often stoop to engage in the language of fools and fuck-twits, for either curiosity's simple pleasures, or for the sake of food or sex.

The night stars seemed beautiful, if I could still see them. I had encountered my vision as non-visible all of a sudden. Or perhaps for a while, I couldn't tell, but I was mostly preoccupied with the gnawing notion that the extraplanetary shit wasn't fucking working.

I cursed every god and every fucking Hollywood ET I could thing of in between humongous heaves of bile brimming with a humming hue of a shade admittedly unknown to me. I didn't give much thought to this, as I had chucked up alot of shit from the bowels of my... bowels, and had often found this to be the Entryway to a Proceeding Path of Bliss.

Not so this time around, I quickly found.

Shards of spastic chromatically-induced nausea appeared to stab me in several orifices I wouldn't even guessed I had until I passed on.

Now believe you me, or me you, however you want to me yourself, I am a man much learned in the art and proceedings of passing out, otherwise known as 'Blacking Out' or 'Jumping Turbines'. What followed was nothing of the sort, it was more of a crushing feeling of weightlessness breaking free between the screaming tendons and fibers of my bones.

I would have very much liked to scream, if nothing else to get my mind off the hitherto unreconcilable pain, however motor functions seemed defunct, and the very memory of such a capacity seemed excruciatingly cruel.

No matter, yesterday, today. Matter was yesterday, today was then, Now; No Matter

I felt myself getting madder, and happier, despite the collapsing cavities imploding within me.

Organs felt compelled to play a song, and then the Others started singing along, until I too was humming a tune of an unknown diddy, though it seemed every so witty.

I then tried to take note of my appearance, but it appeared my eyes had resolved to roll over and under my brows and were now taking bows to unwarranted applause (in my book)

I resolved to wiggle my way back into fine form, or just form at all. All I could do was spurt some juice that vanished as soon as it hit the back of my throat.

'Hmmm..if I'm not mistaken, I have been taken' was my last thought before the whirl started to swirl, starting first withinside me.

'ah, of course, here we gooooo again'"

"event","I live in a room where a mother-to-be  was murdered, 
  along with her fair baby

the walls are sea-green, but the room perpetually blue
the way the deep sea longs for the touch of light,
yet still gives life
   to creatures unseen
yet still they are beings
      and such is she, and little pickled baby
preserved in matters more than just melancholy memory 

Indeed, it is she, howling when the winds screams streaks of shrieks
sending its ringing shrapnel throughout my ear's room
And her, again, when the rain drip-drops,
humming softly with the breeze as it stops
to stoop and squeeze under my doorway
to whisper windy tales with no more words,
only a darkly flicker fathomed faintly as absurd

And her, once more,
 when the thunder bellows tyranny,
startling little pickled baby, 
      petrified in yet not-gone ghoulish grooves of rooms
and murky, twilight hallways

she, yes she, is there to shhh shhh little baby
and lil' ol' bystander me,
   i float off to sleep
by the shhhh
                       of a distant touch and tone
of body and flesh
                       to me unknown

and yet here do we all reside
   here, at home
where we are never alone
    and now do i close my eyes
       and slip into sleep's sweet serenity
               floating in translucent eternity"

"event","Meditating in a Crowded stadium
     during Monday Night Football

you are aware of the energy, but you do not tense up, lest you trap and own it

you are porous, you let it flow through you like water
     nourished, but not attached 
present, but not imprisoned,
    you are the current and the rock,
the wave and the shore,
   the Finite and the More


""Just like drinking cool water on a hot day, feel how the breathe cools the inner organs of the body,
Conscious breathing makes the mind and body One""
   - Thich Nhat Hahn

if you guys ever get the urge to sit at any point or place of beauty, or want to reach this space inside your head if it doesn't show itself on the Outside worlds, try these fun ways to inflect each In/Out breathe with a healing message of massage and eternal intention from your brain to your body and the Outside Whirlds


Breathing in ----> I calm my body
Breathing Out ---> I smile

Breathing in ----> I am the present Moment
Breathing Out ---> I know it is a wonderful Moment

Breathing In ----> I see myself as a flower
Breathing Out ---> I feel fresh as morning dew

Breathing In ----> my breath grows deeep
Breathing Out---> my breath goes slooowly

Aware of my body -------> I breathe In
Relaxing my body -------> I breathe Out

Calming my body -------> I breathe In
Caring for my body ------> I breathe Out

Smiling to my body -----> I breathe In
Easing my body --------> I breathe Out



     Time-Less Nest,
                                     Mind-Full Nest


i breathe in the bells
   for they breeze in the Buddha

the bells breathe me
   for i am vibratory motion
Stable in the Moment
   a lover in the ocean
i swim, i sink, i fly, i breathe, i live, i die
all under the blink of an ""I""
 in every EternaLinstanT

the waves of the bells
wash away thoughts
   and take me to this moment
Anchored in Here
   Nurtured by Now
A Moment i call 'Home'
   whenever i breathe and smile
i know i am never alone




""It is not words or concepts that are important. What is important is our insight into the Nature of Reality and our way of responding to Reality...

......Enlightenment for a wave is the moment the wave realizes it is water.    At that moment, all fear of death disappears""

Catchin glimpses of kisses thru our Laughter

is Destiny Disaster? 
or just a sparkling-cider after-taste
to the Symphony of Space
which fuels the youths as they use waste
to reArrange insane frames
to burden beauty with blame

in this
our telescope novella,
it ain't no worse
no' betta' than a word to da letter
a tip off da top
a puddle to a mop

Forever never had the urge to stop

this time the puss masking his mouth shriveled up the moment I ceased looking at him in childish fear

I could feel my fingers sprout out like carrots thirsting for air after a 1,000 year drought

""what do you want?"" i asked in a winded whisper

""to see your world""

""how can i do that?""

""write a song about me and sing it in only the wee hours, deep into the sun's slumber, where magic reigns supreme.""

i awoke and found i could not speak for 3 days until i wrote his song:

'Dream-child, come round
 laugh and dance to the sound
of memory's shores
shifting you forth
  to waking worlds,
where gingerbread grins
sit with timid teacups
as they float with fins
and chatter eagerly about your arrival

Dream-child
lift your eyelids
incite your revival
Dream-child
you are here
a friend amongst harmless beasts and beer
Dream-child
you are here
drink in your breath
  you are here

Never fear, 
  never fear
Never fear forever'"

under a sun so wheezy and dying
on this fucking rock
i spin, feebly trying
trying...
trying...to win
instead i start
from whence i begin
again

He skips to every place of merriment he roams to (which indeed is anywhere he frolics to), plays a mean mandolin and a smooth flute that will make you send a letter of mournful longin' for the green motherland in the form of a silent tear. He is also entitled by blood as his grandfather on his mother's side was a leper and his great grandfather on his sister's side was the mighty sherKhan of the jungle. 
 
I can personally say Allister is an eternal source of joy and laughter to his friends and his spirits play tickle-tag with the world, you could find a worse Leprechaun than him in any other place you look."

"event","""There are 13 crystal skulls known in the world at this time. MAX is the largest, weighing 16 pounds. Many, including the British Museum, consider Max to be one of the rarest artifacts ever found on the planet. Estimated to be at least 10,000 years old, MAX was found in a tomb in St. Augustine, Guatemala, between 1924 and 1926. He was used by the Mayan priests for healing and prayer.

After studying in India, Norbu Chen, a powerful healer of the Tibetan sect of Red Hat Lamas, traveled to Guatemala where he studied with the Mayan priests. It was here he came into the presence of MAX. Chen was given this precious artifact when he left the Mayans so he could use it in his journey as a healer.

JoAnn Parks met the Lama through their family medical doctor when her twelve-year-old daughter was dying of bone cancer. JoAnn ended up working for the Lama for many years. Before Norbu died, he gave the cherished crystal skull to her with no explanation but that someday they would know what the crystal skull was all about. After many years, communication from the skull told JoAnn of his name and his desire to assist humanity by direct experience. Now JoAnn travels with MAX across the country providing this experience to all who are called.""

It will take you nowhere

a lever and a harness
to bind your heavenly wings
weights these are,
like laws and things

we need no rulers
just wisemen and fools
to free us from our mind's dungeon

"" ""Mr. Bahari, you're suspected of espionage. You have been in contact with a number of known spies."" He named a few of my friends, mostly Iranian artists and intellectuals in exile. A car was coming to take me to a counterespionage unit, he said. There I would be interrogated more than 15 hours a day and subjected to ""every tactic"" until I talked. The investigation would take ""between four and six years."" I could be sentenced to death.

Haj Agha made sure to say the word ""death"" as if he were talking about a cup of tea. In fact, he immediately said, ""Would you like a cup of tea?""

""Thank you,"" I said. I could barely get out the words. I was lost in thoughts about my mother, about Paola, about our unborn child. How could I have put them in this situation? I was a bad son, I thought, a bad husband, a bad father.

""Unless,"" said Haj Agha, pausing one more time. ""Unless you would be interested in a deal, Mr. Bahari.""

""You have been telling the people that this is the Eleventh Hour.
Now you must go back and tell the people that this is The Hour.


Here are the things that must be considered:

Where are you living?
What are you doing?
What are your relationships?
Are you in right relation?
Where is your water?
Know our garden.
It is time to speak your Truth.
Create your community.
Be good to each other.
And do not look outside yourself for the leader.

This could be a good time!

There is a river flowing now very fast.
It is so great and swift that there are those who will be afraid.
They will try to hold on to the shore.
They will feel like they are being torn apart, and they will suffer greatly.

Know the river has its destination.

The elders say we must let go of the shore, push off toward the middle of
the river, keep our eyes open, and our heads above the water.

See who is there with you and celebrate.

At this time in history, we are to take nothing personally, least of all
ourselves ! For the moment we do, our spiritual growth and journey comes to a halt.

The time of the lonely wolf is over.
Gather yourselves!

Banish the word struggle from your attitude and vocabulary.

All that we do now must be done in a sacred manner and in celebration.

We are the ones we have been waiting for !""


The Elders
Oraibi, Arizona

It's like saying all humans have the same intention and are all war-like close-minded beings. Generally, you can trust a being from Sirius B, Arcturus, Pleiades, Vega, Pollux, while I would be very cautious approaching an Orion grey (I wouldn't actually approach one and in fact I had a number of lifetimes outright killing them), a Zeta Reticuli (the race of small greys), and avoid the Draconians altogether although they'll hunt you out if they smell your fear or anger. I've met a couple Zeta starseeds (Zeta souls incarnated as humans) and I do believe at least a number of them are interested in God-consciousness, though the rest of them are on the mind-control chip tip, but the Orion greys and Dracs are unredeemable, and of course, they're the ones who made contact with the American government and military and struck the worst technological deal in unrecorded Earth history.""

"event","I just got back from a free clinic, and was told that I probably have strep throat. Kind of sucks, huh? especially because this will probably cause me to miss one of the most magical shows of the century (i would say year, but I truly believe this will be THE shit): animal collective in big sur. 

I'm glad I've discovered a sense of fate in my life, and the ability to draw lessons and meaning from any and all events that are tossed at you, because I think a year ago I would've freaked out, or at least have been really bummed. I am still bummed, but pretty accepting, and I would just love to get my health back and not wake up with a pulsating, raw lump of pain in my throat blocking me from eating solid foods and swallowing without pain.

so i got home and looked up some stuff on strep on webMD, which lead me to an article on how antibacterial soap and products are no better than regular soap and cleaning items, and they're worse for the environment

(heres the link if you want it: http://www.webmd.com/health-ehome-9/antibacterial-soap-cleaners)

however i didn't finish the article, in fact I was stopped cold by a line that disturbed me so deeply I had to take a plunge into the solace and comfort of the LJ world.

""We talk with our wallets and manufacturers have listened, adding antibacterial chemicals to toothpaste, socks, plastic kitchenware, and even toys.""


We talk with out wallets?? really?? I know I have a shitty memory, but the last couple times I had a conversation I don't recall even having my wallet with me. maybe we were really speaking telepathically, cuz I guess we don't use our mouths, words, facial expressions, meanings or touch to talk anymore, but our wallets. what's wrong with our mouths? have they been stuffed full of fatty foods and cash to the point where we can't speak, just pull out our wallets and point and grunt?

I guess that's just the current state of American Express(ion)"

this is the first posting of media files i have done on lj...so i hope all goes well. check it out, its a couple of gems that i return to over and over. dig ""um girassol da cor de seu Cabelo"", which roughly translates to ""a sunflower the color of its hair""  by milton nascimento and lo borges, especially the epic ending (it doesnt end with the mournful violin cosmic rumble, nope)

also the last song by mouse on mars has all the helium luster that such a furry party animal would have in a planet removed from worry and wate. its just a party baby, so come on in  ;)"

"event","I watched him pull from his pocket an empty tinfoil bubblegum wrapper and watched him unfold it, crumple it up and raise it up to his mouth in a matter of seconds. Even when his fingers were just before his open mouth I was wondering what my uncle was going to do with the tin foil. When he popped it into his mouth and starting chewing I nearly gagged.

""What are you doing??""

""Hmm? Oh, you want some?""

""No. But....why?""

""Toughens the teeth up."" He smiled,showing the tin foil ball resting uneasily between  jagged yellow rows of beer-bellied, middle-aged bar maids exhausted by the strain of the years on their life, yet unable to shake the glittery grin painted on so tawdry tight on lips of sin.

""No it doesn't. It just makes them all worn out and cracked and wrinkly!""

This caused him to roar with laughter, and it was than that I noticed the wrinkles creased into his face like charred fingers to the chain, and it was only than, at that moment, with that laughter, that out popped thirty more wrinkles on this weathered man's face. The wrinkles had leaped out to mock, to show me that they were the badge of life, won through roughness and strife.

""listen kid, you keep your teeth clean until you die and you'll know you've lived a sorry sad life indeed."" hehe he chuckled.
""cigarette?"" he asked me, pulling a large plastic bag filled with half-to-nearly burnt cigarette sticks out of his sandy brown knapsack.

""I'm 14"" I informed him.

""14 huh,' he stroked his chin, at first out of what appeared to be elderly contemplation, but then it transformed into a frantic finger clawing at a demon itch crawling up and down and down and up and up and up and down, all around from his chin to his neck to his cheek, but all the while he held his smile, and silently considered the age of 14.

""when I was 14"" he finally said, ""I was a chain smoker for about two years. Now I take my time,"" he chuckled once more, and went to draw fire from his breast pocket's match sticks. 
""yep, now I take my time"""

"event","Giorgos catches glimpses into his future in his present.

There: He is eating at a fine, white table on the slope of a hill. A angular meal, no doubt, but fine tea, yes yes.
A friend watches from over the adjoining hillside.
""Come closer, share in my meal"" Giorgos calls.
Chuckles flutter about in the wind's sneering hiss.
""No, not today"" Giorgos is told



Giorgos walks up to his house. His head is snapped to a newly planted tree in the front yard. This is a horrible omen.


He turns foreward and an old man with deep valleys of skin wrinkle stands before him.

He starts running over the slopping hills awash in golden haze. Over the next hill he sees himself being dragged with bloodied knuckles and knees through the dirt by hidden men.

He stops to stare, and is tackled by himself.
""I must stop you!""

""No! No! Let me go!!"" He struggles, and he struggles, and they struggle, but future Giorgos beats him down with an open palm and teeth barred like fangs before the flame.


Whoever is chasing him will catch him
Whoever is chasing him will catch him

Sometimes a short vignette of a dream will awake me and I write it down in my bedside notebook, in darkness and semi-conscious confusion. Then when I truely awake the next morning I find words that perplex me, so I decided I want to immortalize some of them on LJ so I could come back to them and maybe see what the funk they mean someday.

They both gazed lazily but victoriously at the crumbs of the cheese they could not bare to finish, for a feast had just been devoured, and much too much wine had been drunk

""I said something to you once, in the years of our youth,"" said one to the other, ""these words they were sweet, and these words they were drunk. Do you remember what they were?""

""No, not a clue!"" said the two to the one.

""Nor I!"" and they both gave a squeaky laugh to fill the walls that hid behind the halls.

""How drunk we both were!"" they shouted in glee ""and now! once more!"" squeaky laughs all around
ANd then they hugged and proclaimed they were to be best friends for ever, and again, for ever more.








All this while I was trying quite hard to fall asleep, but could hear only damn drunken, joyous mice behind my wall."

"event","we look under rocks
for creepy thoughts
and memories from home
the wind, it chills, but we take it as a hug
and on we stumble
They never made me think of you, until I was so far, until they could crumble and crack in my hands as I exchanged mine for yours"

"event","It was just a vomit-snot thought with a disdain for the sane,
a desire for the warmer fires of taunting desire,
but only if we could have danced with the flames
with both our flesh, so charred and burned
we could both shoulder the blame
or just leap: evaporate, so we can jump with the rain
and jump on the heads of fuckers who need their bald spots wet
and they thought there life was over
well, nope, not yet
they may sleepwalk to shop talk to fall down and act cold
and yes, they're aging, and yes, they're old
but their lives ain't over and done with quite yet
we are now mischievous little condensed droplets of vapor,
and this no one shall forget"

"event","How do you turn a human away from hate? Not by feeding him more of his evil disease. Give a hater a hug and give him the chance to love you. Give a hater a hug, they may be disarmed by love. 

Note: I don't think this would work with an army, but you can't hug an army can you? The best way to send this message is one-on-one, and let them know that we are One, but no army"

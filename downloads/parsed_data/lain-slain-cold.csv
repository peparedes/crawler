"event","I was at working and I was reading the newspaper like I do when times are boring in the Hell known as Circle K and I am the Satan of this Domain.  And I read several articles that pissed me off.  One hit kind of irregular from the rest.  In the midst of all these articles about children abductions and molestations.  That lead to murder and all that.  I read an article by this lady and she was bitching about a pedophile who was trying to get over his obbsession with children and what not he would like to do with.  But this guy tries hard to stay away from temptation and he beleives that their should be stronger laws and stricter laws against sex offenders.  And she was complaining about how he is not a complete expert on that stuff and should not be allowed to talk about it.  Well I got sitting there thinking and well I came to this conclusion.  The Lady who wrote this article is a dumb ass and deserves something horrid to happend to you her cause well frankly she is stupid.  He is an expert about the consequences of the actions of sex offenders.  Cause well lets face it he learned frist hand.  I think she like most females just needed to complain about something.  I mean he did the crime and did the time and he feels that there should have been a harsher sentence.  I mean look at this Bentley guy in Cedar Rapids.  He had done it before and did not serve his full five or seven years can't remember which.  Instead he only served 2 1/2 years.  To me that is utter and complete bullshit.  They let him out on good behavior.  Whatever.  But do to a crappy sex offenders registration the parents of the girl didn't know he was a sex offender.  So there should be stricter laws towards them and I have to agree with the guy this woman complained about.  Now I do not nor will I ever endorse Pedophilia in any case.  I am just complaining about some one who complained about something that was good.  On to other things.  I am starting to get nervous Friday night is my fist singles match and I am getting butterflies thinking about it.  I mean this is a huge step going from ""eye candy"" to kickin ass.  I just hope I don't utterly screw up.  But I am not sure what else to say so I am signign off.  So long and have a nice Day!"

"event","Yo I am back once again.  Here the deal I have to make some major decisions.  One is figuring out the living situation.  I want to go back home so I can have my own room once again.  My land lord kept calling me today and last night to know when I could pay my rent.  I told him I would pay him the money tomorrow.  I don't have the money to pay him but I wanted his ass off my back for now I don't need him harping on me. I am not sure what is going on with me emotionally.  I mean I am still going through my divorce and well I have girls on the mind but I am afraid of being hurt once again.  There are two girls I have huge feelings for right now.  But me being the pussy foot that I am can't talk to them about it. I should be getting ready for work but you know what I really don't want to go.  That is how bad I am feeling today.  About money, girls, and bitches.  I honestly just want to sit and cry.  Cause I am afraid this is just pushing me farther and farther into my depression.  Why Can't They Sell RIBBON CANDY all year long?  Damn that would make me feel so good right now.  I mean with everything that has gone on lately I am having a hard time keeping it together.  To top everything off my parents tell me to get my divorce done with, stop thinking about girl and think  about getting my life in gear.  But I need to settle down and start a family.  *scratches head*  I am not sure what crack my parents are smoking but the just contradicted themselves.  Well I am not sure what else to say in this today.  So I will end my thoughts today with this.  A man is only as good as his word.  But if his words mean nothing he is nothing.  On that note I am going to end this and also ask any christians reading this please pray for me and to all the others please keep me in your thoughts."

"event","Friday, about 2:50 pm.  It slipped from my hands as I was steadying the side piece.  My friend Robert had left me to go help move the ring posts in place. When suddenly came the loudest clang I had ever heard.  Then came the loudest obscenity I had ever yelled.  I run around for a moment screaming.  Then I looked at my shoe.  I was in horror you could see a bulge in my shoe.  I frantically untied my shoe, almost tearing through my sock.  And there it was a softball lump on the top of my foot.  I looked at my foot and asked not really to ask but to make a statement that I needed to go to the Emergency Room.  I had fear my foot had been shattered cause it certainly looked at it.  Well by the time I got into the car.  I had lost feeling in my toes and I move them.  To say I was scared would be an understatement.  For the first time in my life I was concerned for my wellbeing.  I wanted to cry but the tears wouldn't come I stayed surpriseingly strong.  Well on the was to the ER I received a phone call from my landlord wanting to know where rent was.  I was like I called your cell phone and told you it would be a couple of weeks before I could pay.  And he started to raise his voice at me to tell me he didn't have a cell phone anymore.  I was like look I am sorry but it will be a couple weeks I am busy right now!  Well we got to an entrance at the hospital.  And well it wasn't the ER entrance.  I am like go to the ER entrance.  And Maskman (that is who took me there) gets out of the car and runs for the ER entrance I yell get back in the car I need to go there so drive me. He was like your right!  Well we get to the ER and well Pobanz god I love him for some reason.  Goes to find me a wheel chair.  He was running like a chicken with his head cut off.  I waited for about five minutes and I began hopping into the ER when he finally showed up with a nurse and a wheel chair.  So I get checked in I get told there will be a couple of minutes before the Triach nurse can see me.  So there I am for a couple mintues which turned into an hour and a couple minutes oh about twenty.  During this time I am in a wheel chair wheeling myself up and down the hall around the chairs.  I couldn't sit still.  Yes I know I was in a wheel chair all I could do was sit.  Finally I am sitting there and Pobanz gets the idea of taking a picture of my foot.  He does so I can see a side angle of it.  I looked and once again I was almost to tears but refusing to cry.  First words out of my mouth was well how was everyone elses day.  So I sat and listened to them about their days.  Then I told my story of my day and well the foot thing was the tip of the iceberg.  Not to be confused with a Godlberg!  Any way I finally get in there and I am answering questions that have nothing to do with my foot.  Like have I had a TB test.  Screw TB I don't even know what it is.  I was waiting for the do you have genetal herpes questions.  We never got to those and for those of you now wondering no I do not have them.  Finally xray time and to make small talk the STUDENT OF MEDICINE ask for the hundreth time what I did.  I was like look it was personal!  Darn STUDENTS.  Well xrays are done.  The doctor decides you know what we are going to play a fun little game of soft and sharp.  She breaks a wooden q-tip.  Has me close my eyes and proceeds to stab my foot with a wooden broken stick.  Then she pokes and prodes.  Looks me in the eyes and says yep it's broken let me go look at the xray to verify.  Then she comes back look at me once again and goes it's not broken, not even a crack.  I was like wow I am lucky.  Anyway I get back to the Armory.  I go and get shaved so I can make my presence known.  And well on the way back while I am on crutches a couple fans are making fun of me making rude comments and what not.  I became angry and then came either the smartest or the dumbest thing I have ever done.  I look to my friend Jesse and I say go get my other boot and my fish nets.  He goes and gets them and comes back.  I start getting dressed I had people plead with me not to do this just go out there with crutches and my funny looking shoe from the doctor.  I had to do it for myself I had to do it to reassure myself that I was not a pussy damn it.  Plus I didn't want to give those low-life scum fans the chance to pick on me more than what they had.  By scum fans I meant the ones that had made fun of my before the show.  Not all fans are bad I need to clear that up in case some people think I completely hate them.  This was friday.  Saturday I live my hellion life style.  Got my dick sucked and what not.  Sunday came.  I watched the Sting Movie not once but twice.  I got thinking could God have been the one that had kept my foot from being shattered let alone broken.  I am constantly thinking about I am very fortunate and what not.  I mean things could have been worse but the fact that my foot was just bruised was like a blessing to me and almost rethink my whole faith issues.  I am not sure what to think eventually I think I will come to something until then I am not sure.  But I would like to end on this note.  By His Stripes we are healed.  Through His blood there is enternal life."

"event","Today, a girl that I have been trying to date for awhile.  She told me that she liked me but I had to give her time so she could get over her ex.  Well we were hanging out and well he called.  He wanted her back.  I became hurt, angry, and sad.  I was happy.  I was like finally a nice guy got the girl and poof it was ripped away from me.  It was like I was a kid again, and I watched my older brother take my favorite toy and rip it apart right in front of my eyes. The thing that hurts the most is I was partying with a friend and her ex came over and talked alot of shit about her.  Which in turn pissed me off.  But I respected him by not knocking the living crap out of him.  I mean let me paint a picture of this guy.  He is 27 years old, drinks all the time, has a couple kids and doesn't take care of either of them, and everytime he gets drunk he breaks up with this girl.  A real winner this guy is.  She wants a guy she can settle down with and have a family with.  How can she have that when he don't take care of the kids he does have?  It is father no wait let me rephrase this it is parents like this that make me sick.  They turn their backs on their children so they can still be young and dumb.  I say parents cause let's face it b*tches do it to their children as well.  I wanted to be with this girl once she had two kids fine by me as long as though kids came first.  She would have rather smoked pot infront of her kids than take of them.  Some parent.  But back to why I am originally writing.  I was hurt to the point of almost having tears.  I wish just once I wasn't getting sh*t on.  I did nothing to these people but be me and that is not good enough for them well F*CK THEM!!!

  I am not your work horse, I am not your Whore,  I am none of these.  I am The Devil! So Get over it!"

"event","Well most have known I have been studying Satanism.  Well I have found just like Christianity it has it's problems.  It is said to be a religion for MAN.  I have found they have rituals and/or traditions.  Why is it inorder to have a faith you must have rituals inorder to feel apart of it.  Part of me has thought about sitting down and starting my own.  The question is would I have followers?  Yes I would have followers if i spouted out mindless non-sense like other religions.  Don't get me wrong alot of the beleifs in Satanism are good ones.  But it is the rituals/traditions that bring it down and drag it through the dirt.  And yes Christianity has drug it through the dirt as well.  Why, oh why?  Must I do certain things in a certain way looking a certain direction.  For Christ's sake!  What is the purpose of having free will if everything we choose is just going to crush it and take it from us.  I have had questions asked to me what do you beleive?  I look at them and go you don't want to know.  I have asked many questions.  Like why is we must all bash each other on what we believe?  Well I have come to the conclusion that it is because of Religion!!!!!

  I mean if it wasn't for Satan and his ""followers"" the Christian church would have run out of business years ago.  And if it wasn't for alternative religions we wouldn't have all these reasons to kill each other.  People say smoking is the leading cause of death.  You know what it is just mindless dribble that the ""beleivers"" that smoking is bad give you.  The leading cause of death in this world is stupid people doing stupid things in the name of GOD!!!!!!!!  So before you ask yes I believe in GOD.  But I find him to be an ass.  Why is it GOD has free will but yet his followers don't?  Answer is simply because we as a society has been led to beleive that alot of these things are wrong and shouldn't be done so there for to make you feel guilty for what every you have done.  We are easy people to lead.  We all can be convinced easily.  And yes even myself is included in the we.  So in this I ask if Satanism is suppose to be the religion of free will then what is up with the rituals/traditions.  If you don't follow them then you are not a beleiver.  

  So now I want to bring forth something new something real.  I want to bring forth a new religion.  The religion of free will if you may.  Were you do what you want and beleive what you want as long as it doesn't infrindge on the free will of others.  Like Murder that will definately be a no no!  I don't have everything pictured out in my mind on how it will go.  But rest assured there will be no standing up and singing with the congregation unless the congregation wants to.  I will not stand behind a pulpit and preach my gospel once again unless my congregation wants me to.  Well there be confession not unless they want there to be confession.  But I would like everyone to tell me if they had a good time or not.  Sins?  Hmmm would there be sins?  Well look at human nature we are all sinners.  So yeah there would be sin.  Should people repent of those?  Only if they are Christian.  And you know what no matter race, creed, color, sexual preference, status, and what every needs to be there can be apart of this.  Who am I to say who can and can not show up?  If I was to do that and then I would be GOD and well I don't want to be an ass. To the Christians I will most like be known as THE DEVIL and well you know what we are born of the flesh, and we are flesh so why not live for the flesh?  On that thought I will let you all be.  Until next time this is THE DEVIL signing off."

"event","I went to a benefit yesterday.  And well there was a band playing.  They played a slow song and well everyone had someone to dance with except me.  But I saw some one looking at me while she was dancing with who she was dancing with and well.  I think she is cute and all that, but my friend is related to her and says I don't need the Drama.  Well any ways the only strange thing is she is pregnent and I am not talking beer belly looking preg I am talking full blown preg.  That when they walk they look like they waddle.  Well so I sat there drinking my beer and looking around thinking.  I am a sad person, cause I feel lonely.  Part of me so wants to stop being single cause I am tired of waking up in a bed alone and going to bed alone.  Any way I finished my beer and left.  I continued to sit and think some more.  My birthday is coming up soon and well with what I have chosen for my religion I should throw a huge party and live it up.  But with every holiday I don't beleive in celebrating it.  Well I left the benefit down and sad.  Going through my normal mind set that I have had lately.  So I went to walmart and got myself something.  Something that makes me happy slightly or makes me feel better atleast Ribbon Candy.  I am not sure what it is about it but damn it is good.  Well I am done here."

"event","Well you all may be wondering what a Television Turkey is?  It just so happens that today is Thanksgiving.  And well my family went off to eat without me.  So that is what I had to eat.  A turkey t.v. dinner.  Yummy!  YEAH RIGHT!!!!! And why is it they have to put peas in with turkey?  I hate Peas.  I had to work for three hours today.  It was a biggest waste of time in my life.  I stood behind a register thanking people for coming to the wonderous world of Circle K ( or cicle jerk as we like to call it).  Anyways I had to stand there for three hours and listen to people talk about how great their lunch was and all the pie they got to eat.  I had a dollar so my lunch consisted of little debbie snacks (which by the way their cup cakes suck hostess is way better).  So feeling jipped I went to walmart after work and bought a tv dinner and some booze.  Woo woo nothing says thanksgiving dried up microwaved turkey and some cheap booze.  God I hate being poor sometimes.  Well anyway I was playing Smackdown vs. Raw this morning and well I had my butt handed to me on several occasions.  Finally I started winning.  At wrestlemania I was in a tornado tag fatal 3 way ladder match and what was a top the ladder?  Titles, money, a breifcase, neither of these attop the ladder was none other that Trish Stratus's panties.  LOL.  And who ever got her panties she would manage them.  Well I was partnered with Kane and well he took care of everybody and i ran for the panties and won.  Woo Woo if you can't win a title nothing says winning like a pair of Panties! Well on that note I am going to sign off this thing."

"event","Well all welcome back to yet another rambling of me.  I came home today to find threatening phones calls towards me.  Well if my name was Crystal.  My voice is on my voicemail yet people still threatened to kill this crystal girl.  Needless to say I was pissed.  So I called one of them back and was like look this is my phone i don't know any crystal so you need to back the f@#k off. And if you know anyone else who has been calling me tell them to go to hell and stop calling me.  Well today was a great day wasn't it. I was horsing around with a girl a few weeks ago.  And well i didn't touch her inappropriately at all.  I basically put her in a head lock and well I was accused of feeling her up.  So well the guy who did it today came into the store and well i ingored him and he was trying to talk to me.  I just wonder what lie he is going to come up with to tell my boss.  Well we confronted this guy about what he said and well he accused my co-worker of feeling her up as well.  Well his story changed each time he told it.  I coughed and said bullshit.  He is like that is not bullshit.  At one point in time he also told me he received a phone call from vinny mac. I confronted him on that as well and well the story kept changing.  I hate liars.  grrrr.  I want to smash him right then and there.  So there for i think darwin's theory survival of the fittest should be instated in life.  Kill everyone that is beneath you.  That is what I have commissioned my followers to do.  Now if i only had followers.  Hmmm where to recrut them.  Oh well I am leaving for this segment of my rant.  I will talk to you all latez."

"event","I should be in bed at this time but alas I am not sleepy.  I sit here most of my time now thinking about what is best for me and I am not sure what it is.  My parents have talked to me about it and don't really want me to do it, but yet it was their idea to bring it up to me.  My mother suggested I file bankruptcy to get rid of my money problems.  Only thing is if I do I will lose my trailer.  I know it is not much of a home but it is the closest things I have had in years.  I also want to start all over at the same time.  Also why is it parents, mainly mothers bring up the strangest things?  Like things you don't really want to think about.  My mother looked at me and asked me if I had washed my bed sheets and I was like no why?  Well she says how do you know that Marie (my wife, soon to be ex) and Chris (my former best friend/best man at my wedding) didn't screw in my bed and leave his seed behind.  Well being disgusted by that I ripped the sheets off my bed.  I slept in it acouple nights sans sheets, and well it has affected me so bad that I can't sleep well cause of it.  So I have spent the last couple nights on the couch.  But now I sit and think about what if they screwed on the couch as well. Ok now I Have just completely horrified myself.  Can't sleep his spermies will eat me.  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!  why is it bad things happen to good guys.  Well I like to think I am a good guy I am not so sure if it is true anymore.  I have been having dark thoughts, like really dark thoughts.  My mother thinks I should go see a doctor and get put back on depression meds.  She talked to her doctor about the drugs I was on for it and well the doctor said my doctors were overdosing me.  That is a comforting thought that my own therapist was trying to end my misery.  Kind of Ironic isn't it.  I went to a therapist cause I was suicidal and they try offing me.  (in shock and horror) They tried to Kavorkian my ass.  Well enough of this I will talk to you all later."

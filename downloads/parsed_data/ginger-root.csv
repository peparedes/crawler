"event","The spring has come in with a fever. Sweating dreams and vertiginous midnights; dizzy spells of the heart. The delirium of the blooming. Desire thick and hot through the vein, the smell of skin under hands, wet soil, night fog. Pounding, thrumming. And all cued to the currents of Neko Case's new album, <i>Middle Cyclone</i>.

<i>Can't give up actin' tough,
It's all that I'm made of.
Can't scrape together quite enough
To ride the bus to the outskirts
Of the fact that I need love.</i>

The seashore, mud clogged with salt and secrets. The trees cramming the sky with the new leaves they shove out between rainstorms. And the rainstorms. The streetdrains moaning, so full, aching and swollen. 

<i>I lie across the path waiting,
Just for a chance to be a spiderweb
Trapped in your lashes.
For that, I would trade you my empire for ashes.
But I choke it back, how much I need love.</i>

I dubbed this Music Summer. Shows planned here and there. Capped by the Newport Folk Festival. Gillian, The Avett Brothers, Fleet Foxes, The Decemberists, Iron & Wine... 
I feel chock-full of music and words. I haven't been writing because there's so much stored in there. I feel like it will pour out of me, or slide out of me, heavy and writhing like a coiled rattler. 

It's all turning right now. This life. The beginning of the growing season and there's so much change coming--I can feel it pulling itself up the horizon. I'm in for a storm. I'm in for a cyclone.


<i>This Tornado Loves You</i>

My love, I am the speed of sound
I left the motherless, fatherless
Their souls dangling inside out from their mouths
But it's never enough
I want you

Carve your name across three counties
Ground it in with bloody hides
Their broken necks will lie in the ditch
Till you stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it
Stop this madness
I want you

I have waited with a glacier's patience
Smashed every transformer with every trailer
Till nothing was standing
Sixty five miles wide
Still you are nowhere, still you are nowhere
Nowhere in sight
Come out to meet me
Run out to meet me
Come into the light

Climb the boxcars to the engine
Through the smoke and to the sky
Your rails have always outrun mine
So I picked them up and crashed them down
In a moment close to now
Cause I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss
I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss
How you'd sigh yourself to sleep
When I'd rake the springtime
Across your sheets

My love, I am the speed of sound
I left the motherless, fatherless
Their souls dangling inside out from their mouths
But it's never enough

My love, I'm an owl on the sill
In the evening
But morning finds you
Still warm and breathing

This tornado loves you
What will make you believe me?"

I totally predict a 2009 blow-up for this band, Harlem Shakes.

At least at the indie hipster level. I mean, check out their debut <a href=""http://www.harlemshakes.com"">album artwork</a>. Fantastic, right? Makes you want to hear the album, right? Go look for it, because it's awesome. It's available online, and then in stores next month or March or something.

They're huge dorks playing together and it's awesome. I mean, it's collective awesome shit."

"event","My friend, Matt, posted something on his blog today about ugly art vs. beautiful art. And I wanted to think about that and respond to it. And then I decided I would share that response with you guys. NOW, I&nbsp;have a lot of amazing, talented artists as friends here on LJ, so please do not judge my decidedly subjective and uneducated thoughts too harshly. ;) Your thoughts will totally be welcomed and you may 100% change my mind on things. I'm open.<br />Anyway, this is the email I&nbsp;sent:<br /><br />In the morning I may disagree with everything I'm about to write. But I want to get it all out while it's in my head, and your entry about ugly vs beautiful really got my wheels spinning. I thought about leaving an in-depth comment on your blog, but I felt like this could get so loooong and I felt like maybe it wasn't the right forum for all of these thoughts. And even <i>worse</i>, I worried about your friends and family potentially reading these thoughts and thinking they were totally lame. :) Anyway, I'm just going to pour these thoughts out, unedited, so things might get redundant. I apologize ahead of time.<br /> <br />I kind of feel like I want to contextualize my feelings about ugly art vs beautiful art in a wider framework of purpose. What I mean is that I feel like one of the functions of great art (beyond being nice to look at or to hang prints of in my bathroom) is to explain me to myself. Beyond its nature, beyond it being ugly or beautiful, I think it's safe to say that great art evokes a response from us. I think that's why it endures, and why we look at it, reprint it, share it, teach it in classrooms. It's because we, or a majority of &quot;we,&quot; connect to it in some way. It might remind us of something in our histories, or of someone, or of something we once heard, or whatever. We look at a painting or read a passage in a novel and there is a moment of recognition-- the sudden realization that this artist or writer sees something in the world that you see in the same or similar way, and suddenly there's a quick mirror into yourself. &quot;I see you seeing this in the way I see it and therefore, I can see me seeing something. I can see the <i>how </i>of me seeing. I see me.&quot; I mean to say that I think viewing or experiencing great art is self-exploratory. In a manner of speaking.<br /> <br />It seems to me that beauty/ugliness is such a deeply subjective judgment, so I'm just going to be subjective in the way I think about it. What can I say...I'm a subjective kind of girl. So much more emotional than rational sometimes. You know this. Anyway. I want to think about beautiful and ugly art first, and then see if I can apply any of that to writing. <br /> So. If we accept this thing that I feel about art, that it can provide a &quot;mirror of self&quot; (of sorts), then it's easy to see why beautiful art inspires us. It means that experiencing really soul-touching, beautiful art provides a moment of recognition and connection with this beauty in <i>ourselves.</i> We look at the Fountain of the Four Rivers or at a Botticelli and maybe we see some glimmer of ourselves in the bend of a wrist or the expression in the Venus de Milo's eyes (the fact that Botticelli painted Venus as a redhead, for instance, might make me connect more with that piece). Or maybe it's less literal than that. Maybe it's just that, given the chance or the talent, we would actually envision Venus in a similar way, or maybe it's just that we've noticed something familiar in the way Bernini sculpted Ganges' posture. Whatever. We connect. That's the bottom line. And in connecting to something beautiful, we feel a sense of our own beauty, maybe. Or even just our <i>potential</i> for beauty, which might be even <i>more</i> important: that beautiful art gives us hope. And when we have hope about our own beauty, then we begin to believe in our own goodness, too. We can believe in our own generosity, compassion, our ability to give and receive love; and perhaps more importantly, all the ways we are good to one another. So, beautiful art takes us from a personal experience of beauty into an expanded and collective sense of beauty, until we feel connected to a sense of shared humanity. It makes us more than a solitary figure-- we become part of a whole. So feel this collective generosity, this potential love, and it opens us into a sense belonging. Acceptance. Mutual similarity. Hope. It's pretty fucking resplendent.<br /> <br />So... ugly art. I feel like &quot;ugly&quot; art isn't just art that's made badly. I mean, poor form, crude work, whatever. I don't think that stuff really deserves the title of &quot;ugly&quot; in my mind (though I'm no art critic, obviously, I know nothing, I'm just a chick with a laptop, a cup of tea, and some time on her hands). I think of that stuff as just boring. Poorly made. Not even really worth a descriptor. Instead, I think of &quot;ugly&quot; art as describing or depicting something or someone or some act that is dark, scary, &quot;unnatural&quot; maybe, cruel, and nearly always (for me anyway), human. I feel like the ugliest art, in my mind, is horrifying to our consciousness, but also emotionally devastating in some ways. Scenes of rape, blood, dismemberment, torture, all come to mind. Hieronymus Bosch comes to mind right away, but there are plenty of truly creepy works out there. And what is so grotesque and nightmarish about this kind of art, for me, is that it points the &quot;mirror of self&quot; away from a vision of us as beautiful and hopeful and instead shows us the most terrifying, vicious, and soul-crushing parts of humanity. It scares the living bejeezus out of me. Because if we accept that we're a part of this huge humanity that is capable of generosity and love, and that we can see that in ourselves as well, then we have to accept that we are part of the same humanity that is capable of murder and brutality and bloodlust and see <i>that</i> in ourselves as well. Ugly art is unforgiving. We see the things that disgust us about humanity; and therefore, the things that disgust us about ourselves. It's deeply unsettling and becomes deeply personal. If beautiful art expands our awareness from the tiny perspective of just <i>ourselves</i>, then ugly art flips the telescope around and reverses the lens back to just us, in isolation, and reveals our dark natures, fears, deviance. It's so ugly because it's us. And what in the world can shame us or disgust us more than seeing the deepest vileness we can think of reflected <i>in</i> us? Nothing frightens us as much as ourselves. If great art explains us back to ourselves, and beautiful art describes our fresh goodness, then ugly art is stunningly powerful in its ability to strip that hope and remind us of our own feral monstrosity. And there's despair in that-- as much despair, maybe, in ugly art as hope in beautiful art.<br /> <br />So...writing, as opposed to visual art. I never thought of writing as being ugly in the same way Bosch paintings are ugly. Mostly because I never thought of it as particularly visual. Some of what you do, Matt, is visual though, with your text boxes and your form, so you've totally provided a perspective-shift for me in that regard. But when I think of ugly writing, for the most part I think of stuff that's similar in content to what I described before. It's just that instead of being depicted in tempera, or clay, or color, it's being depicted in verbs and adverbs and paragraphs. Same ugly, different clothes. So, for me, it's a similar experience-- reading the ugly and seeing the ugly. However, there IS a little something that frightens me more with writing than with viewing. The thing that scares me the most when reading something truly horrifying is not necessarily the scene or the depiction or description itself, but it's how alarmingly accurately my brain conjures up the accompanying images. It's, again, my <i>own </i>mind that terrifies. How could my brain, which has never been subject to whatever scenes of torture or hideous cruelty I might be reading, leap SO easily to construct that vision? And there I am, scared again by my own potential for horror. Suddenly, this awful ugliness that was, a moment ago, only text on a page becomes intensely intimate and personal. We invite ugliness into the kitchen before we even know we've done it. And what's worse, it seems it's not a stranger, it's been here before and there's an intimacy. We're involved. It's uncomfortable. <br /> <br />It takes courage to engage with ugly art. Hell, it takes courage to engage with art, period. There's just no hiding ourselves from ourselves, and art banishes any hope of that. We're equal parts beautiful and terrible. <br /> <br />I don't know if I just inspired myself or depressed the everloving shit out of myself.<br /><br />"

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3031/2890654705_a110b01d9d.jpg"">

I'm so sorry I've been incommunicado. Life has been chock-full of work and the slow hatching of ideas kept captive much too long inside this cocoon. 

We've been feeding these two beautiful loving stray cats outside of the bakery for the past couple of months. They are the sweetest two little creatures ever. Yesterday Cheryl found a home for both of them and the woman swooped right in and took them off to the vet. None of the rest of us got to say goodbye, and even though it was absolutely the right thing to do...even though it's getting really cold and even though they deserve a loving home and even though none of us could take them in...I still cried into my pumpkin bread today. 
I miss them.
And their funny mismatched tails.

Sometimes when I sink into a yoga pose and stay there a little longer than expected, I feel things shift. I think opening our joints is directly correlated to opening our hearts. And bending our bodies bends our notions of things.
I want to know the pose to open my heart.
To shuck these autumn nerves. 
To love through things.

I've been slowly reading this book, <i>The Passion</i> by Jeanette Winterson. It's so short. But it's crammed full of this prose that unlaces everything in me. I found myself tearing little bits off of my bookmark so that I could mark the pages that emotionally shoot into me the most, and now my bookmark is a single shredded slip tucked into one of the final pages. A testament to how shockingly gorgeous this book is. 

<i>""I'm not looking, I've found what it is I want and I can't have it. If I stayed, I would be staying not out of hope but out of fear. Fear of being alone, of being parted from a woman who simply by her presence makes the rest of my life seem shadow.

I say I am in love with her. What does that mean?

It means I review my future and my past in the light of this feeling. It is as though I wrote in a foreign language that I am suddenly able to read. Worlessly, she explains me to myself. Like genius, she is ignorant of what she does.

I was a bad soldier because I cared too much about what happened next. I could never lose myself in the cannonfire, in the moment of combat and hate. My mind ran before me with pictures of dead fields and all that had taken years to make, lost in a day or so. 

I stayed because I had nowhere else to go.
I don't want to do that again.

Do all lovers feel helpless and valiant in the presence of the beloved? Helpless because the need to roll over like a pet dog is never far away. Valiant because you know you would slay a dragon with a pocket knife if you had to.

When I dream of a future in her arms no dark days appear, not even a head cold, and though I know it's nonseense I really believe we would always be happy and that our children would change the world.

I sound like those soldiers who dream of home...

No. She'd vanish for days at a time and I'd weep. She'd forget we had any children and leave me to take care of them. She'd gamble our house away at the Casino, and if I took her to live in France she'd grow to hate me.
I know all this and it makes no difference.

She'd never be faithful.
She'd laugh in my face.

I will always be afraid of her body because of the power it has.
And in spite of these things when I think of leaving, my chest is full of stones.
Infatuation. First love. Lust.
My passion can be explained away. But this is sure: whatever she touches, she reveals.""</i>"

"event","01. I am undone by the new Sigur Ros album.

02. I'm obsessed with this track off of Jenny Lewis's new album <i>Acid Tongue</i>. I literally have played it at least a hundred times over and over.
The actual song starts a minute into the video, FYI. Enjoy
<lj-embed id=""20""/>

03. Have you ever listened to Dead Can Dance? They're, like, gothy and orchestral and operatic and middle easternish and all kinds of stuff I don't know how to describe. But they're pretty amazing.
<lj-embed id=""21""/>
I play this tune <i>loud</i> in my car and dance magic dance myself home from work. I absolutely insist that you listen to this without watching the dude singing. Because it's just absurd that he's a bearded white guy in a polo-style pullover. I <i>know</i>, it's hard to get past that, but just go with it, brothers and sisters. 

04. Thao Nguyen is totally new to me. She came to me on two different mixes from two different amazing pals from work. She is SO up and hip and fun and happy. Plus, her band name is Thao with The Get Down Stay Down.

"event","Jesus Christ, <i>Cosmopolitan</i> just needs to go. 

I can't even begin an insightful or witty prologue for this blog entry, tonight, because I'm just too tired after baking for twelve hours, and I just want to get this out. My friend Taryn and I have had the same conversation a couple of times while at work, that we could see ourselves ruining our own lives if we actually read <i>Cosmo</i>. And, basically, what I mean by that is that <i>Cosmo</i> just makes me feel downright awful about myself. 

I can't ever imagine plucking my eyebrows more than every other week, I don't bleach anything, I own no styling products (unless shampoo and Burt's Bees Milk and Honey Lotion count), and I just don't want to ""know what he's thinking"" if it's <i>always</i> going to be something like, ""I love it when she takes control"" or ""I'm not worried about your thighs (unless they're huge)."" But, of course, if I even just glance at the cover of <i>Cosmo</i> (or any of the other swill available in the ""Women's Interest"" section of the newsstand at the bookstore), then I invariably walk away feeling like the Seacoast's Most UnFeminine Homely Pariah. And I can't stand it!

I know. I know this is exactly what they're trying to do so that you'll buy the magazine and feed into its cyclone of self-hatred and then rush right out to buy products and shave every last hair off your body and then buy more of their magazines. I get it. And this isn't a feminist political rant. You know I could write that if I wanted to, but this is more about a woman feeling totally inadequate when in the mere presence of a 150-page rectangle of post-consumer waste reshuffled into the same dating advice as last month.

Honestly, I'm embarrassed that it even has this kind of power over me. It vomits the same information out in every issue (seriously...how many times do we have to read about the Kegel exercises?), and OBVIOUSLY it's about as intellectually or emotionally or spiritually stimulating as the celebrities it interviews (Paris Hilton, this means you). And it really irks me that just when I think I've reached a new pinnacle of self-awareness, I walk by <i>Cosmo</i> and I'm fourteen again. <i>""I'm so scared of the 'Inverted Swan Suck' and I know I'll never be able to do it, but I'm pretty sure HE wants me to try and I don't know how to tell him how scared I am of it.""</i> or <i>""Oh nooo big boobs are out, little boobs are in! Maybe I really SHOULD be thinking about a breast reduction.""</i> Or whatever.

I mean, it doesn't last long. I can usually snap right back out of it again. But it happens. 

And guys don't escape this treatment either. I mean, these magazines tell you that no guy is really worth it if he doesn't have a killer job, a huge dick, and a shark's sense of ambition. I don't think kindness is ever really discussed. Honesty is, supposedly, very important, but only as long as he says the right thing always, and apologizes for anything you need him to apologize for, and only as long as his apologies are always heartfelt. Anything else is just a waste of your time, honey, and really, you're worth better.

Aren't we just worth the right kind of love for each of us? Even if it comes, as Joni Mitchell wrote, ""to my door, with a sleeping roll and a madman's soul""? Even if it comes to us kind of rundown and confused, but sincerely hopeful? Silly and emotional and hectic? Nervous and aching to please?

I don't know how else to say it...I just get really sad. I'm just sad at what we've done to ourselves. We have this sweet capacity for real love. This gentle, warm, tender freshness, and we deny it all to pieces in favor of silicone and lies, and it just puts me at my wit's end. I know you know what I'm talking about. It takes so much energy to resist and to force thought patterns in a different direction. To dance and laugh and be real with each other. To speak honestly. To stop judging. To love sincerely.

In the most recent issue of <a href=""http://www.utne.com""><b>Utne</b></a>, I read a quick article about phone sex workers that really blew me away. At Wheaton, the Women's Studies department had a lot to say about sex workers, and I was always really interested in that particular worldview--something so alien to me, so I read this piece, totally absorbed in the lives of people who live such <i>decidedly</i> different lives from mine. The thoughts of one phone sex operator, a gorgeous young black man named Ray, really resonated with me:

<center>""My name is Ray. I've been having phone sex off and on for 14 years. I was 19 when I started to embrace my sexy self. I see myself as a love doctor, or even a psychiatrist. I am a Venus, goddess of love. I create a sense of community for my regulars, including the closeted and married bi or gay men. I'm constantly soul-searching. I see a reflection of myself in all my callers. I help bring out their inner light. I try to heal the wounds that our closed-minded society inflicts. It may sound weird, but it's true. We as people should learn to talk and listen to our neighbors and share out inner light. Be aware of what makes us the same, what makes us one. I wish the world was run by phone-sex operators.""</center>

I just want us to get back to a place where we are real with each other. Where we are trembly and cautious and therefore brave in our loving. Where we're not reading magazines for ""Tips to Make Your Butt Look Smaller When You're Getting Out of His Bed in the Morning"" or ""Make Him Think You're the Sex Goddess You've Always Wanted to Be""; but instead, reading books that make us understand our world and ourselves, listening to music that moves us, working hard at jobs that make us feel good, dressing in clothes that make sense to our own style and our own lives. Because we're so lovely, even in our fear, and we have so much to offer each other if we could just get past that fear. Aren't we supposed to be ""resplendent avatars""? Aren't we?"

Amazing book. When people at the bookstore discuss this book, I often want to give them free coffee. Like, you are into <i>The Alchemist</i>? Yeah? Ok, here's a cup of coffee; do you want to make out?

<b>3. Ash trees</b>
Perfect, since I'm named after them. I think they're gorgeous.

<b>Nine Things about Me</b>
1. I am nearly emotionless now when it comes to goodbyes. Mostly because I've never met a really painful goodbye that I haven't proven false. By which I mean that people come back around in my life. But maybe this isn't true....maybe it's more that I HAVE to be emotionless because goodbyes are so damn sad. It could just be as simple as that.
2. I love wrinkly elbow skin.
3. Sometimes I use self-tanner on my legs because they NEVER get any color. It's, like, some trick of science.
4. I'm lazy as fuck. No, really. I work a lot of hours, and I get a lot done, but I'd rather be cuddling.
5. I believe in secret lands. I kind of don't want to go into it because I kind of think it's weird and embarrassing.
6. I am allergic to bell peppers of all colors. I may have already told you this.
7. Before I get up in the morning, I stretch in bed. It's funny-looking.
8. The smell of strawberry popsicles takes me back to this time when Patch Galligan and I were like 8 years old and we were going to a circus and he had eaten one and then threw up in the backseat of his mom's car, all over my <i>Where's Waldo?</i> books. 
9. I love the word <i>savage</i>. And <i>savagery</i>.

"event","Have you ever seen the film <i>The Magdalene Sisters</i>? It's really amazing, but that's not really what this entry is about. You see, at the beginning of that film, there is a scene at a wedding reception in Ireland in the early 60s and a priest plays the old traditional Irish tune The Well Below the Valley and plays the bodhran. When I first saw this scene in the film it was so stunning to me that it kind of made me gasp. In fact, I ended up borrowing the DVD from Thea just so that I could watch that two-minute scene over and over again. Really though, it's incredible to watch someone play the bodhran really <i>well</i>. I feel like it's such a tactile, emotional instrument. And it stirs me up. Who knows, maybe I've watched people play that instrument a million times in a million past lives in Ireland. Or maybe it's just the love of traditional tunes passed down. 

Anyway. Sadly, that scene <i>was</i> nowhere to be found on YouTube until today when, randomly, I found it. Totally off the cuff. I'm not even sure how I found it, but I found it. And I want you to see it (and I also just wanted to post it so that it was easily accessible to me so that I could watch it over and over again because I'm a strange Irish freak).

So, check it out. But I want you to forget that it's supposed to be a priest singing the song, because that particular ""priest"" never shows up again for the entire rest of the film, and that ""priest"" is actually played by a dude whose name I don't remember, but who is a fairly famous Irish traditional musician, as I recall. So, focus on that instead because it'll make it somewhat more understandable that he leans down to kiss his bodhran at one point.

Enjoy my two-minute obsession.

We are wrathful insurrectionaries and exuberant lovers of life dedicated to navigating our way through this peculiar turning point in the evolution of our 14-billion-year-old master game. It is our sacred duty to keep our imaginations wild and hungry and free, and to make sure that all of our fellow messiahs, even those who volunteered to play the roles of ignorant deceivers, have the chance to keep their imaginations wild and hungry and free.

How might we start... [moving] in the direction of becoming more festive, relentless champions of the liberated imagination?

For starters, we can take everything less seriously and less personally and less literally.

We can laugh at ourselves at least as much as we laugh at other people. We can blaspheme our own gods and burn our own flags and mock our own hypocrisy and satirize our own fads and fixations.

We can enjoy the pleasures of healing mischief, friendly shocks, compassionate tricks, irreverent devotion, holy pranks, playful experiments, and crazy wisdom.

We can inspire each other to perpetrate healing mischief, friendly shocks, compassionate tricks, blasphemous reverence, holy pranks, and crazy wisdom.

We can be humble enough to understand that it's a crime against life to act like a know-it-all who has everything all figured out.

"event","When I was younger, I hated History class. I guess it seemed to me that, considering how much stuff happened since humans first staggered into an upright position, History class <i>ought</i> to be a class of great stories. But instead it always boiled down to charts to memorize, dates of obscure events, and endless facts about the American Revolution, that, come to find out, weren't even entirely true. 

I mean, I loved the <i>idea</i> of history--of lords and ladies, of social customs, of voyages and discoveries and the toils of men and women as we met and re-met one another across continents and seas, of cultural shifts, of uprisings and change, of great art and progress and multiple renaissances. But...still, with all of that happening...where were the great stories? And beyond the story issue, I think I've come to realize that I never found History class particularly fulfilling because ""History,"" at least classroom History in my limited experience of it, has come to be constructed not as a rich interweaving of the intricacies of human existence, nor as a means to understand humanity, but as an endless succession of suffering. Tragically, instead of being presented with a dynamic explication of humanity's joys, loves, betrayals, fears, and ecstasies, we are served the interminable narrative of mindless killing arranged between nations. 
And so, for me, History has become a leapfrog dance of this war to that war to that war to present day. The End. Story-free.

When it comes to History, it seems I am desperately seeking context.

Without context, these war narratives create such a reductivist view of humanity, no? Imagine this. Imagine an alien sitting in on History classes from middle school through high school. What would that alien learn of humanity, of the evolution of humans and human thought, of the evolution of human society? I think this alien might come to assume that, of Earth's landmass, roughly three countries actually exist (with Europe counting as a single country); that these three countries are at war constantly and their borders also change constantly; that women spontaneously arrived in America in 1920, leaving them just enough time to secure their right to vote before disappearing again into extinction until the 1970s when they again appeared just in time to publicly burn their undergarments in the town square; and finally, that humanity, as a whole, spent and spends its time racing to see who'll be the first to annihilate the rest of its species and blow up the planet. 

And what a vision. Maybe not totally inaccurate, but certainly only a small slice of the picture. 

I'm not a cynic, far from it in fact; but, with that kind of cynical view of History, it's probably no surprise that it didn't exactly inspire paroxysms of delight in me at a young age. However, now, after a decade of time, and the chance to read more than a required list of texts; after meeting Jordan Bentley (a most inspiring roommate and History teacher) and Megan Oliver (a lover of all things historical and all things contextual and story-like), I realize...those great stories...they're out there. They're totally out there. And they're available in forms that are unsanitized, untouched by textbook authors and public school curriculae. 

And I suddenly have <i>so</i> much to learn.

In the past year I've read <i>A Natural History of the Senses</i>, <i>A Short History of Nearly Everything</i>, <i>An Intimate History of Humanity</i> (which I'm now re-reading because it was written by an Oxford dude and it's pretty dense and I'm pretty sure I missed a good chunk of the middle bit the first time around), and parts of <i>A People's History of the United States</i>. All amazing, all approaching History through different lenses while actively discussing those lenses and their potential biases. 

I think it's pretty correct to say now that the History of our country and, of our <i>world</i> (jeepers) is full of great stories from so freaking many different groups of people that I'll never come even slightly close to absorbing the better portion of them. And that's what's so exciting! There are creation myths and folktales and travel ballads and great bard poems and holy texts and stories from the oral traditions of a billion tribes to hear and read and learn and sing. IT'S INSANE.

I want to look at the world, and my place in this huge crazy human family, as if I were a teensy novice anthropologist...an amateur paleontologist sifting for History in the sand and fossil remains of stories and folkways. And I just basically wanted to write all of this down to communicate how pumped I am to be back in conversation with History...to be pals with History finally...and maybe, by figuring out some of the stories of where we came from, someday figure out where we might be going. Or at least, dream a little dream of it, and then roll over and wake from it, and then get up and help live it."

I just came back from a quick visit up at my parents' place. It rained the whole time. But I still took to the gardens to survey the July bounty and found that the North Country is suffering under a siege of caterpillars. Those nasty little fuckers. I took these photos during a rainstorm. On another, but related, note... I need to believe you don't need photography classes. To, you know, take good photographs. That you don't need a dSLR or a thousand dollars or a macro lens or the perfect eye. Equipment, lighting booths, a tripod. I just need to believe that it's all about the willingness to slosh out to the snap pea vines during a rainstorm. You need only the bare feet and the $150 cheap camera and the muddled composition and slapdashery of half-assed garden art. You don't need the trappings, you just need the fun. I need to believe this, because otherwise, why the fuck am I taking so many photographs?

I reached full expression in this pose last night at yoga class. I know it doesn't look like much, but just try to open your legs, keep your knees straight, your feet slightly pigeon-toed, and bend down at the waist. Try to get your hands to the floor, then move them back so that your wrists are in line with your ankles and your elbows are slightly behind your knees. And then lean even further forward to invite your head to touch the floor and then stay there. 

To practice noticing. To understand simple things. To give myself clarity. To face inevitable difficulties. To make a conscious choice. To welcome my feelings. To know pain. To experience the bliss of effort. To take gentle possession of my mind. To feed my mind. To be aware of my sensitivity. To dip below superficiality. To brighten my eyes. To forget how I look. To stop moving. To let myself be how I am. To love deeply. To risk being myself. To sit upright like a pyramid. To stay still. To breathe in the air. To encourage a positive habit. To behave in the manner of one who has woken up. To pursue freedom. To touch the ground. To learn without words. To unlock my heart. To go beyond.
-Lisa Cullen, <i>Why We Practice</i>

My yoga teacher recited this last night while we were all laying down at the end of class in savasana (corpse pose...that'll give you a good image of what it looks like) and I almost cried. 
To be aware of my sensitivity. 
I don't know when I last was aware of my sensitivity. How do we do that? How do we contact what is most sensitive in ourselves and ease those things into the light, talk with them, become comfortable with them?

I feel so raw these days. Not in a bad way. Not in a sorrowful or sad way, but just exposed. Like there's more of the often-hidden parts of me showing right now. Like I've cut something open. Like something long hardened has softened.

Pema Chodron wrote: ""Only when we know our own darkness well can we be present with the darkness of others. Compassion becomes real when we recognize our shared humanity."" I've never been comfortable with my own darkness, only with others' darknesses. What does this say about me?

""An image of loving-kindness is that of a mother bird who protects and cares for her young until they are strong enough to fly away. People sometimes ask, 'who am I in this image--the mother or the chicks?' The answer is we're both: both the loving mother and those ugly little chicks. It's easy to identify with those babies--blind, raw, and desperate for attention. We are a poignant mixture of something that isn't all that beautiful and yet is dearly loved.""

Hey. You. You reading this. You are dearly loved."

<b>CocoRosie <i>La Maison de Mon Reve</i></b>
Two ladies. Take two great lady vocalists, give them a grab bag of things that make noise, some old studio equipment, some samples, someone on the beatbox, stir, let simmer. 
And all kinds of madness ensues. 
This album is jam-packed with juicy summertime freak folk deliciousness. Peppered with found sounds (champagne corks popping, chirping birds, crickets, rain), split beats, trip-hop, breath sounds, jingle bells, beatboxing, acoustic guitars, something kind of Billie Holiday and Bjork and Jesca Hoop and Joanna Newsom and Devendra Banhart, etc etc. 
This is pastiche music-making, and hell, I'm a fan. Get the whole thing if it sounds the least bit interesting to you, or at least get ""Not for Sale."" It's gorgeous and ultra-feminine and different and it inspires me. Makes me think of layers of muslin tapestries under tree branches in mid-July. It's too hot outside, but we brought a lot of lemonade. It's sexy in a gentle way. 

Like all fun new music, I found this in the weirdest way. I was cruising around YouTube as I'm known to do late at night when I should be sleeping, and I found this video:<a href=""http://www.statcounter.com/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://c13.statcounter.com/1380421/0/cb6c2257/1/"" alt=""web log free"" border=""0""></a>

It's this guy somewhere in the world that is Not America. And he's doing a track-by-track review of a mix cd that his longtime penpal made for him after his most recent breakup. I love how earnestly he talks about each cut. I like that he has what looks like a self-portrait in the background. I love that he's way into The Be Good Tanyas. And I love his penpal! I feel like I basically have made that same mix three or four times (minus Badly Drawn Boy, Ben Folds, and Dispatch). Crazy. If you actually want to read the whole track list, it's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14x25igMpxA"">here</a> in the description section. 

I feel like we should all be making videos like this... you know? Videos in which we describe how much we love the mix cds we just got in the mail."

10. Back off.
09. Come closer.
08. Fucking him ain't gonna make it any easier, darlin'.
07. I want to make out with you.
06. I want to know what your floor feels like against my shoulder blades while I listen to your music. With a candle burning in the corner.
05. You're exactly the right person for me to have an adventure with.
04. You were so close to self-actualization and you shut the door. Get back to that place because you're magnificent there.
03. I'm so sorry. I want to lose this pride. I want to humble myself.
02. I don't think he's as amazing as you think he is, but he is definitely a good person. Just stick to your guns and you'll be fine.
01. Thank you for running so much interference. I don't even know how to thank God for having you in my life. 

<b>Nine Things About Myself:</b>
09. I smacked my forehead against the huge metal refrigerator in the bakery yesterday. I hit it so hard that my skull resounded and I saw stars. I had to squat for twenty seconds or so to get my bearings. And now I have a huge lump.
08. I love the color combination of dark turquoise and mustard. 
07. I'm doing Ashtanga Yoga now. It's pretty much amazing.
06. I'm really trying. I'm trying so hard to be the best version of myself, but it's a struggle. I want so badly to extend my compassion and be gentle and let sincere love express itself through me every day. Thank you for helping me, by the way, all of you.
05. Although I love love, I think I'd be ok if I were alone for the rest of my life. Either way would be fine, I think. As long as there are adventures and pals.
04. I love owls.
03. I think there are surprises involved in my future. Things that even I, with my insane imagination, cannot even envision.
02. I took my multivitamin with a beer today.
01. My favorite meal these days is a baby greens and spinach salad with goat cheese, strawberries, and walnuts.

<b>Eight Ways to Win My Heart:</b>
08. I'm easily seduced by words-- especially alliterative prose.

06. Look into my eyes.
05. Touch my hands. Hold them. Run your thumb over my knuckles.
04. Laugh. A lot. Joy is the richest aphrodisiac for me.
03. Let your mind be a judgment-free zone.
02. Make me mix cds. A lot of them. And be really happy when I make you a lot of them too. (ha)
01. Read. And then tell me about it.

<b>Seven Things That Cross My Mind a Lot:</b>
07. Ok, I'm a little scared. Deep breath.
06. I need water.
05. How much is a gallon of gas?
04. Do I have cell phone service here?
03. Holy crap, you are such an asshole. [insert shit-eating grin] (This is mostly in reference to people I wait on at work.)
02. You are saying the most amazing thing right now. I love you. (I'm not kidding, I think this a lot.)

01. Amber ring, big amber cuff, vintage silver dangling earrings, huge headphones

<b>Three Songs That You Listen to Often (Currently):</b>
03. ""Look at Miss Ohio"" by Gillian Welch & David Rawlings with Gaida Hinawi on backing vocals (not the album version, but the version from the soundtrack to ""Jimmy Carter: Man From Plains"")... Please download this song, ASAP. It's absolutely mindblowing.... Arabic/Syrian vocals meets American Roots...Holy shitballs.
02. ""3 am"" by Gregory Alan Isakov. Some of the most amazing lyrics out there right now. 
01. ""Coyotes"" by Jason Mraz. Absolutely all of <i>We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things</i> is capturing my heart.

<b>Two Things You Want to Do Before You Die:</b>
02. Only two? Find the perfect bra.

I love getting mail. And something fantastic arrived yesterday. Thank you so much Miss Kit Fox for my extended (not late) birthday gift! 
I got gorgeous-looking soaps, Hawaiian hard candy of multi-interesting flavors, an adorable book, a watermelon key chain, and an absolutely LOVELY cd of chill ambient French music. Surprising, but wonderful. I listened to the tunes yesterday while trying to organize my insane life, and they definitely staved off a nervous breakdown, so thank you ever so much. Plus, who doesn't need more ambient French music? 

<b>Llama Gratitude</b>
She came to the graduation party on Saturday. She flew from Seattle to Boston on a redeye, got in at 5am, bought a car, and drove up to my graduation party. Who is this incredible woman, but my darling friend? 
<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3119/2609737336_a4b17dd047_o.jpg"">
She also took me into some new places later that night in some deep conversation that I'd been missing and I didn't remember how much. I've realized that in this past year I've really closed a lot of my emotions down in order to sort of survive the grueling schedule I was keeping. While my heart has been opening into brand new places with all of this new knowledge and passion, I've sort of closed inward as well. I suppose, like I said, it was in a protective way, but it's also been sort of as a way to begin some intense self-work. We all need to take the time to work on ourselves, but I really cannot stress how incredible it is to have the kind of soul friends who not only support you in doing that work, but also lead you into new places you hadn't uncovered yet. Llama, you're incandescent. Thank you for being what I admire.

<b>Lily Gratitude</b>
Holy shit, she's knitting me legwarmers.

<b>You Gratitude</b>
Because you're the berries."

<lj-cut text=""Country Love Song"">
<b>Country Love Song</b>
by, Melanie Almeder

I try to think of the cup of a hand,
of legs in a tangle, and not the thistle

though even it, purpled, spiking away,
wants to be admired, wants to say, whistle

a little for me. O every little thing wants
to be loved, wants to be marked by the cry

that brings desire to it, even blue-eyed fly
to the bloated hiss of death. To love is to be remiss:

the horse alone in the wide flat field nods
its head as if the bridle and bit were missed

or mocked; the cow slung with the unmilked weight
of her tremendous teats shoots a look back over her shoulder

at O lonesome me. I want to say to her need
as if crooning could be enough,

sweet, sweet mama . . . truth be told,
the thousand lisping bees to the milkweeds' honey

terrifies me. When the stink of slurry season
is over and the greened fields are slathered, fecund,

overtall foxgloves tip with the weight of their fruit.
Then I dream a little dream of you

and me, curled like two grubs on the top of a leaf
wind-driven and scudding along the lake's surface.

All night we glide to its blue harbor
and back again. The fattened slack of us

singing O darlin' darlin' darlin'. </lj-cut>

Ok, and this one too.

<lj-cut text=""Fishing Seahorse Reef"">
<b>Fishing Seahorse Reef</b>
by, Enid Shomer

Our lures trail
in the prop-wash,
skipping to mimic
live bait. Minutes ago
I watched you
cut up the dead shrimp
that smell like sex.
Now we stand, long
filmy shapes jigsawed
by the waves, and wait
for the rods to arc
heavy with kingfish.
We bring the limit
of eight on board,
their teeth gnashing
against the lures.
And I think how tender
all animal urgency is--
these fish thrashing
to throw the hook,
or a man flinging himself
into the future
each time he enters
a woman. This
is what I picture
all afternoon: you
inside me, your body a stem
bent under the weight
of its flowering,
as beautiful as that;
how carefully
you would lower yourself,
like something winged,
a separate order
of fallen thing
from these angels with fins
who know only once
the difference
between water and air.
</lj-cut>

And <a href=""http://poetrymagazine.org/magazine/0907/poem_180005.html"">this one too</a>. Siiigh. I can't help this love affair with words. I'm greedy for them. I string them together and admire the ones you all string too. When you write something that touches me, I remember it always. There are still full lines of Abby's poetry that live in the grainy whorls of my brain. There are books on my shelves that I take down late at night just to crack the spines and re-read that part, that one part, that I was thinking about when lying in bed just a second before. I can't help this love affair with words, though it may be one-sided. It stirs me up and leaves me cold. Words will never love me back, but I'll take the curve of an alliteration in a paragraph if it's what I can get. 

I'll be sated by this black typeface against white:
the reverse of stars against the night."

"event","I'm surprised by a full day off. I usually have school all day on Saturdays, but not today. And I must admit that the random day off has sort of spun my body off-rhythm. I feel sluggish, achy. I think being forced into a day of rest has kind of put me back in touch with the fact that I've been running myself a bit ragged these few months. I know I should be playing outside in the sun, but all I can muster is the energy to refill my water glass, munch an apple, read this book from cover to cover, tap out a little entry to you lovely folk on the other side of this computer screen. 

I'm really obsessed right now with this lovely song ""The Husher"" by Abby's and Bran's friends, R.E. Bell. I just added it to my MySpace page which lives <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/clovermoongrass"">here</a> if you want to listen to it. Or, if you like, head over to <i>their</i> page, right <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/rebellsongs"">here</a> and give it a listen. They're so lovely and backwoods. I've never met them, but hopefully someday. 

I think I need to post some photos. It's been a while. And I haven't been snapping much lately, sadly. But here are a few from here and there. Mostly they're shots from a Doll Hospital I visited late at night... the creep factor is pretty freaking high on those ones. Lots of dismembered doll parts (remember that Hole song?). And some shots from a benefit that the bakery did with the Humane Society.

I live for these moments.

And even though there are plenty of stresses in my world right now... shit... life is beautiful. Like, <i>really</i> fucking resplendent. 

And so I feel like a good gratitude journal entry is just way overdue. I think the last one was MONTHS and months ago.

It's amazing how the actual sense of feeling old can actually sneak up on you. A week ago I was 26 and felt fine, and now that I'm 27 (well, as of the 16th), I feel old. How can that come out of one week? 

There's just so much to do in this life of mine. I want to go to Bali. I want to bake a pie over a fire, because I know it can be done. I want to sleep outside under the cool New Hampshire black night sky. I want to bake loaves of anadama bread and deliver them to my dearest friends. I want to feed strays. I want to have incredible sex in a hayloft. I want to swim in every river I drive by. I want to go to <a href=""http://www.heartwoodinstitute.com"">The Heartwood Institute</a> out in California and learn Polarity and permaculture. I want to grow artichokes. I want to laugh so hard I can't breathe. I want to work every damn sore body from here to San Diego. I want to roast carrots and read delicious books and sing and fly to Hawaii to have Kit's special pizza. I want to pick olives in Kalamata with Anne. I want to dream and share and love and have hard times too. I want the blues at dinnertime, old raspy folk in the afternoon, and breath in my ear during the night.

And I don't think I want kids. And I'm really surprised at myself for that one. It came out of nowhere, but I just don't think that's the path for my life. I want to paint with <i>your</i> kids, but then I want to come home and scratch the cat's chin and stay up late and get up late or early or whatever. 

I want to save the world, it's true, but I want to know what the world needs too. Maybe I just want the world to heal itself. Maybe that's it. Maybe I want too much. Maybe I'm a little greedy when I write things like this. Maybe all I want is to get out of debt and try to live more lightly. Maybe I want to have the time to figure out how to decrease my carbon footprint. Maybe I want to educate myself more. Maybe I want to finally finish <i>A People's History of the United States</i>. Maybe I want to be doing yoga everyday. Maybe I want to get better at working on a frozen shoulder. Maybe I want stronger thumb joints. 

I totally know age is just a number. And I totally know 27 is really young. I know this. But I just freak out sometimes. I think I need to fall apart in order to unclench my fists and stop holding onto everything so tightly. I have this simultaneous need to control everything and just let everything fall apart. It's a push and pull tension that needs at some point to just break. Things fall apart. I need to listen to The Roots and Spearhead and the Dead and Neil Young and drop this fucking anxiety on the floor. Will I ever just let go? Let this all go and stop the mindless static? I need to. I need to. Open the fists. Let all this shit go.

Breakdowns. Breakthroughs. Things fall apart to fall together.
What's shakin', 27?"

"event","So, Ella (<lj user=""silveripseity"">) wrote an awesome post about albums she can listen to <i>all the way through</i>, no skips, on a regular basis. She noted, very astutely I think, that in the music world now, it's all about ""the track"" -- the single, buying that one song from the end of that episode of <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> or from that one scene in the movie you watched last night. So she made a list of the albums she can listen to all the way through, and it's <a href=""http://silveripseity.livejournal.com/161809.html"">here</a> for your enjoyment. 

I decided to play too. It's a bit different for me, only because I'm always more likely to purchase the entire album from someone rather than just a single track. And I'd love to say that's because of a moral desire to support the artist... and sometimes it is, but more often it's because I'd like to believe that if one song off of an album is awesome, then likely something else on that record is going to be awesome too. So, I have a lot of full albums laying around at any given moment. However, like Ella said, really there are so few that I can really listen to the <i>whole</i> thing without at least one song kind of mucking up the pot. But anyway, here we go.

1. Joni Mitchell, <a href=""http://www.newburycomics.com/rel/v2_viewupc.php?storenr=103&upc=08122747952""><i>Blue</i></a>: Probably the penultimate album of my life thus far. I know that's a huge statement, but it's so true. The lyrics dig right into my chest cavity and nestle in there. It's an album of both intense freedom, ache, longing, joy, love, <i>and</i> real raw pain, but all without ever getting actually <i>sad</i> or maudlin. Instead it's vivifying. Vital. It's a manifesto for the heart.

2. Bob Dylan, <a href=""http://www.newburycomics.com/rel/v2_viewupc.php?storenr=103&upc=82796923982""><i>Blood on the Tracks</i></a>: This one aaaaalmost didn't make the list only because eeevery once in a while I have to skip ""Idiot Wind"" because Dylan's voice really gets more nasally than I would have ever thought possible. However, that's not all the time. And, ultimately, I way more often listen to the whole thing. What an amazing album. I mean, ""Tangled Up in Blue"" and ""Meet Me in the Morning"" and ""Buckets of Rain""... doesn't get much better.

3. Bon Iver, <a href=""http://www.newburycomics.com/rel/v2_viewupc.php?storenr=103&upc=65660521152""><i>For Emma, Forever Ago</i></a>: Written in an old rickety Wisconsin cabin during a time of serious loss, this album will break your heart. Jenn Chadd loves it, so is there any better endorsement? Bon Iver is actually Justin Vernon and he retreated to his dad's skeleton of a cabin during the winter of 2006 after he lost his longtime love and his band and suddenly had no idea who he was or where he life was going. It's spare, with mostly just a guitar and his voice. And he sings in falsetto for the most part... which is just gutbustingly vulnerable. 

4. Amy Winehouse, <a href=""http://www.newburycomics.com/rel/v2_viewupc.php?storenr=103&upc=60251724662""><i>Back to Black</i></a>: Yeah, it's just awesome. Start to finish. Too bad she's a total fuck-up. I can't help but feel like it's unlikely we'll get anything else this awesome out of her unless she can get her shit together. We can only hope.

5. The Be Good Tanyas, <a href=""http://www.newburycomics.com/rel/v2_viewupc.php?storenr=103&upc=06700302452""><i>Blue Horse</i></a> & <a href=""http://www.newburycomics.com/rel/v2_viewupc.php?storenr=103&upc=06700303042""><i>Chinatown</i></a>: If I could select a favorite band, this would be it. I love these women, and I can listen to either of these albums in their entirety over and over, and I have. They're all about classic Americana roots tunes with some spice and polka dots mixed in. Whether sad or salty or jubilant or plucky, their tunes capture so many of my moods and I remember the first time I heard the first few bars of ""The Littlest Birds"" in my living room after I bought the album and I felt like yeeessss ok, here's what I've been looking for.

6. Cat Stevens, <a href=""http://www.newburycomics.com/rel/v2_viewupc.php?storenr=103&upc=73145468852""><i>Teaser & the Firecat</i></a>: I used to listen to this album over and over in the basement on my dad's old turntable. From the first simple melody line of ""The Wind"" to the more rowdy ""Bitterblue"" to the hippie deliciousness of ""Peace Train"" this album is so deliciously realized.

7. Cry Cry Cry, <a href=""http://www.newburycomics.com/rel/v2_viewupc.php?storenr=103&upc=79301828402""><i>self-titled</i></a>: Three Massachusetts folkies get together and make a gorgeous album of all of their favorite covers. Yeah, pretty much amazing. The cover of Greg Brown's ""Lord, I Have Made You a Place in My Heart"" is incredible and the a capella version of ""Northern Cross""... Jesus.

8. Gillian Welch, <a href=""http://www.newburycomics.com/rel/v2_viewupc.php?storenr=103&upc=80514701022""><i>Hell Among the Yearlings</i></a>: So, it was hard for me to pick a Gillian album. I love her, but there's usually a song on each album that I skip. Not so much with this one. I think any album that starts with a killer track like ""Caleb Meyer"" is probably pretty strong start to finish, and that's definitely the case with this one.

9. Iron & Wine, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Endless-Numbered-Days-Iron-Wine/dp/B0001ENX54/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1210804512&sr=8-2""><i>Our Endless Numbered Days</i></a>: Honestly, I could have picked any of Sam Beam's albums. He repeatedly slays me. I picked this one ultimately because it's the one I've listened to the most. 

10. Lauryn Hill, <a href=""http://www.newburycomics.com/rel/v2_viewupc.php?storenr=103&upc=509974898435""><i>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</i></a>: Ok, seriously. I don't even need to comment on this one.

11. Steve Earle, <a href=""http://www.newburycomics.com/rel/v2_viewupc.php?storenr=103&upc=09362463552""><i>Train a Comin'</i></a>: I've been listening to a lot of Steve Earle while baking lately. Cheryl, one of my bosses, is SUPER into Steve Earle, and one day she played this album and I was hooked. I love how Steve Earle is too country to be rock and too rock to be country. It's twangy and charged and that's pretty awesome.

So... twelve albums. I guess I thought I would find more, but Ella was right... this isn't easy. I really wanted to put a Po' Girl album on here, or Jason Mraz, or Ben Harper, but I just couldn't really. Although, in Jason's case it's just because his live stuff is so mindblowing that it really casts a shadow on his studio releases for me, so it's not really his fault."

"event","You know, I just want to say something. I feel like I spend a lot of time on this blog revealing bits of myself that I'm not proud of. You know? Like, kind of trying to tease out the things that I'm struggling with and work them out a little bit. And you guys all help with that. And I just want to thank you for always being so supportive and encouraging and fantastic. Because you are. Like, when I say that I'm addicted to pathetic reality TV or I felt nervous about working intimately with people suffering with AIDS or whatever... you've always been very accepting of me talking all of that through, and coming to my own terms with it. Thanks for letting me reveal the parts of me that I'm most nervous of or least proud of. You're fantastic."

I think this is a really huge question. I mean, I'm sure that you sitting right where you are, reading this, can think of one or two things that would freak you out on someone else's body. Like... giant moles or ear wax or dandruff or foot odor or long toenails or whatever. And I get that. I sort of had hangups regarding those things too. At this point, though, I feel like all of that is so irrelevant when I consider our goal. I mean, if someone comes to me in excruciating pain, suffering from a frozen shoulder, am I really going to freak out that they have a lumpy ugly mole on it? No, really, not at all, because all I'm thinking is, ""where is that trigger point on the infraspinatus?"" Our goal is alleviation of pain, not judging the body on the table.

And honestly, actually, I think I was never really as nervous of those things listed above as I was of communicable diseases. I have to be honest... prior to the class on working on people living with AIDS, I was really concerned about that disease specifically. And now, after meeting David and learning about how unbelievably low-risk massage actually is, I feel completely differently. Which is to say that as trite as it may sound, I think education is really the answer to this whole issue of body discomfort. Once I learned about the risk level for massage on an AIDS or HIV patient, my fears and therefore my discomfort, were all dispelled. 

And as for more superficial issues like foot odor or acne, I think it's all about education again, but in a different way. The more I learn about the layers of the body, the systems and its inner workings, the dysfunctions and pain, the less and less important those other issues become. You know? Like, the picture shifts from me touching dirty hair or dandruff, to me working on someone in real clinical pain. And, moreover, I think it's an issue of desensitization. Like, the more I work on things that might make me feel oodgy, the easier it gets. 

Obviously, I'm not totally perfect... and I'm still new at this, so maybe something that really disgusts me just hasn't come onto my table yet. I'm sure something will happen someday when I just can't take it. But until then, I just want to think that I'm un-freak-out-able. At least for now. 

So, the last part of this question is, I think, really interesting: ""Things that would make it really hard for you to get past and give the client a loving massage?"" Because I think the things that would make it really hard for me to give the client a loving massage are not issues of cleanliness or skin troubles or odors. 

One of my teachers told us about a situation wherein she was contacted by a mental health practitioner who asked if she would be willing to see one of his clients who was a convicted child molester. The mental health practitioner was hoping that my teacher would work with this person as a way to give him examples of healthy therapeutic touch. After some very deep soul-searching, I believe my teacher actually agreed and hoped that by working with him, she might keep children safe. 

I understand her line of reasoning and I honor it. But I'm not sure I have that kind of grace. 

How would I handle an IV drug user with track marks on his arms, or someone whose political views are in stark contrast to my own and who insists on spewing political rhetoric during the massage, or someone accused of rape, or someone I suspect abuses his wife? 

Working intimately with a body means working intimately with a soul and with energy and with lifeforce. What does this bring me into contact with? And what will it do? 

I have no idea. I'm learning far more about the structure and lacings of the body, and far less about the spirit, actually. So, I'm thinking of going to see a shaman or some other kind of spiritual advisor to discuss proper ways to ground and center myself when I'm working with other people. How to guard myself against these toxic spiritual impulses. 

A psychic recently told me that after my massages I should stomp my feet and clap my hands to shock the energy off of me. Seems a lot of clattering at the end."

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2039/2356311671_2be313a672.jpg"">

My mother is a very precise woman. She's lovely, and she's a good person, but she's precise. 

When we lived at Edencroft Manor, the bed & breakfast that my parents ran with their best friends, we had three cats. All three were orange tigers, and they were called Martini, Rossi, and On the Rocks. Rocks was hit by a car when I was a baby, so I never really knew him, but I adored Martini and Rossi and tormented them on a regular basis utilizing such methods as tail-pulling and petting their fur backwards. 

Cats LOVE this.

After they sold the inn, we moved into our own home, and Martini and Rossi went with my parents' friends, their rightful owners. I was informed from a very young age that I would not be getting any animals any time soon. Mom was far too fond of her new clean house and her clean rugs. That was the reason I was given. I was allowed to have two guinea pigs for a while. A black one with short, coarse hair, and a glossy long-haired white one with weepy magenta eyes. I, aptly, named the beautiful white one Duchess, and the chunky short-haired one I named Linda. They stuck around for a few years, and it was cool. But they weren't puppies, which is what I really wanted. And they did not require walking, which bummed me out. I went through a begging phase, and even went so far as to tie a string around the neck of my brown Pound Puppy in order to lead him around the block every day for a month to prove to my mother that I could be trusted to take care of an animal. 

Didn't work. Unfortunately. So, I never got a puppy. 

And now, years later, I realize that that was probably for the best. Although I think dogs are totally awesome, I've come to learn that I'm really more of a cat person. Just like I can't really deal with suffocating people, I can't deal with pets that require too much maintenance. I mean, my schedule's nuts, and dogs require a lot. Well, most dogs do, and they totally deserve it. This is not coming from a dog-hating place, at all. Like I said, I love dogs. I just think I have cat energy moreso than dog energy. 

So, to answer your question, Llama, I don't think about getting a dog anymore. But I do think about cats a lot. In fact, that photo up there is a photo of Esther, a cat that I used to regularly cat-sit for. She's pretty wonderful.

As for people that anthropomorphize their animals... I don't judge. The bakers have a separate voice and personality for each of their dead cats, and it's so fantastic to listen to them converse in cat voices. So, I have no problem with that. Unless of course there is clothing involved. That freaks me out."

"event","<b>From Ella: <i>Hmmm. Tell me about a guilty pleasure of yours. Something totally embarrassing, like that you own every Gerardo album or you watch marathons of Zoey 101. :)</i></b>

I am ultra-embarrassing, actually. There are almost too many guilty pleasures in my life to name, so I'll just zero in on a couple.

I never actually thought I would ever get into reality television. In fact, I spent the better part of reality TV's early years totally successfully ignoring it, and admittedly, looking down my nose at those of my pals that really got into reality shows. I mean, I just thought it was ridiculous. Why watch all of the ins and outs of people's lives? Isn't that an erosion of privacy? And aren't these reality stars just exhibitionists and freaks?

There have definitely been times in my life that I've been just the most annoying little pretentious shit.

Enter <i>Rock of Love with Bret Michaels</I>. Instant classic. Love at first sight. 

I have to say, if you're going to watch reality TV, pick something incredible. Pick something that shows you a great cross-section of American life. Something where you get to see anthropology in action...like the mating habits of 40-year-old aging rockers that still wear bandanas. Pick something that puts a bunch of people in a house and something that forces all of those people to compete for the affections of one guy. And don't pick <i>The Bachelor</i>... that's so upscale. Pick the show that replaces school teachers and nurses with ex-strippers and hairdressers from Jersey. Pick the show whose hero continually confuses the word ""mediocrity"" for ""mediocrisy."" Pick <i>Rock of Love</I>.

I'm a devotee of reality TV now. I mean, really. I barely watch anything else when it comes to TV. <i>Project Runway</i>, <i>Top Chef</i>, <i>America's Next Top Model</i>, <i>Real World/Road Rules Challenges</i> (whoa, HELLO Gauntlet III, I thought Easy was going to actually die in the final episode... really freaked me out), and on and on. I'm in love.

<b>From Kit: <i>Write a post about childhood memories connected to weather.</i></b>

Living in Northern New Hampshire, there are certainly interesting weather patterns to write about. Ice storms that crystallize the world into snow globe precision, rain storms that flood the rivers that break through barns, freak tornadoes, lightning that sets fire to mountains, blizzards and hail and the like. But none of these are quite as amazing to me as the autumn when I was nine.

I had the flu. I rarely got sick when I was little. I was chubby and hardy and basically lucky. But this one autumn I had the flu and it developed into pneumonia. I was truly laid up in bed for a couple of weeks with intermittent fevers, aches, chills, and a cough that wouldn't quit.

One night I had been hacking for hours. I sat up to drink out of the crystal glass on my bedside table. Water is such sweet salvation when you're sick, isn't it? I remember watching the light from my reading lamp sparkling through the crystal and breaking prisms onto my quilt when my bedroom door opened. It was my parents and they were excited. My mother was holding an old multicolored quilt with a purple crushed velvet backing. I remember feeling faint as my father scooped me up in his arms, wrapping the quilt tightly around my feverish nine-year-old body, my red kneesocks poking out the bottom. 

""Hurry,"" my mom whispered, ""or we'll miss it!""

My father scurried down the stairs with me in his arms and my mother opened the front door out onto the porch. The October air blew cold and fresh across my face. I remember it taking my breath away, I was so hot. And then my mother's hand was on my forehead. ""She shouldn't stay out long, hon."" She told my father. And then she whispered to me, ""Look up.""

The sky over our house should have been black. With bright white dots. That's how it had always looked to my kid eyes. But that night the sky was a thousand Arabian scarves billowing over the stars. 

The first time I saw the Aurora Borealis, I was nine, in red kneesocks, in my father's arms, and so feverish I thought I was dreaming or that it was magic. One side of the sky was blue and green, another red and purple, and the stars peeked out from between curtains of light. I still can't quite believe it now, years later- years after seeing the Northern Lights other times, years after understanding their locus and the reason for the colors. I still wonder if that particular time it was as beautiful as I remember or if it was all just a passing fever dream, a beautiful mirage, an invented pleasure."

"event","Besides the externship, the exams and the classes and the presentations, another task I have for massage school is a basic research project. I've never been a big fan of research projects, and that's mostly because I feel like it's just a summary of other people's work. You're essentially not allowed to offer any <i>new</i> research into the debate, you just sum up other people's work and deliver it concisely. So when I found out I would have to do one for this school, I was sort of nonplussed. However, I stumbled across an idea that has just been really inspiring to me, and I guess that's the key...pick a topic that fascinates you and you'll be eternally pumped to read more about it.

So, right now I'm researching music as a healing modality. I'm not really looking at music as an uplifting force, you know as something that makes us feel really good and is therefore ""healing,"" though it certainly is that; nor am I looking at music as something that compliments and even improves sessions of healing techniques such as massage, though it certainly does that too. I'm really looking at music as the particular and essential force in healing an ailing body, mind, or spirit. And I'm finding some really amazing things.

My research led me to a woman named Laeh Maggie Garfield, an old-school healer who lived with a shaman for years studying all kinds of healing. She wrote a book about sound medicine, and in it she writes that we all have two songs that are wholly unique to each person. She says we each have a Healing Song and a Lifesong, both of which can be discovered through spirit-journeying, meditating, or drumming with a shaman. Apparently, if you learn your Healing Song and sing that over an ailing person while practicing some kind of healing art (in my case, if I sang my song while massaging you, for example), then the healing is easily a million times more effective, longer-lasting, and far more quickly delivered. She tells pretty incredible first-hand accounts of her experience with this. As for your Lifesong, that's actually a tune that is entirely your own-- the very song of your Life. I admit that I don't entirely understand the concept of the Lifesong beyond the fact that it encompasses you as an individual, your life, everything. It literally is you in song. So, singing it brings you power and centers you, but you have to keep it entirely sacrosanct as anyone wishing to do you harm could easily do so if they found out the tune of your Lifesong. Kind of amazing, but hard to believe in a way. However, in the course of this research, I've also read about these healers in ancient Greece who would sit with a sick person for a few moments, and in those few moments they would take stock of that person's energy and soul, and then they would play a single note on their lyre and the ailing person would be healed. Kind of like discovering the keynote in a person's Lifesong, I thought.

So those are just two of many examples of this idea that we actually hold music within ourselves, in our spiritual or energetic makeups, that we might not even be aware of, and that has a powerful effect on how we live our lives and even who we are. It's incredible to me. I know I'll only be learning more and more about this, and of course I'll keep you posted. If any of you guys have any thoughts about this topic or if you have any resources you want to share, let me know. Otherwise, keep singing, keep dancing, let your souls shine out healthy and glowing and beautiful."

I'm standing just a couple of people away from Ben Harper who is singing ""Sexual Healing"" so hard that his throat is vibrating. His hands are clutched against his heart and between vocal bits he is dancing on stage in complete blissed-out eyes-closed ecstasy. My hands never once leave the air and I'm almost crying with this unfathomable joy even though my feet are screaming in the old black leather clogs I wore without thinking of how many hours I'd be standing and dancing. I think to myself that this must be exactly what religious fervor feels like, with shivers frissioning under my skin, and with my heart overturned like a bowl in my chest.

It's the beginning of the summer. I am fourteen years old and I'm sitting in the backseat of my friend's boyfriend's car after a movie. There are three people in the front seat, four in the back. We're parked in a tiny adjunct parking lot next to the Opera House in town. We don't want to go to anyone's house quite yet. These precious moments after the movie are hard-won, and my friend has just started dating a sixteen-year-old boy with a car and so freedom is ours for maybe the first time. We don't know yet that we'll start sneaking out every Friday and Saturday night to cruise around in this car. We don't know on this night that we'll spend hours out in the mountains watching stars fall and storms move in while our parents sleep silently at home. We don't know that this summer will mark the end of our childhood, really, and the beginning of something lush and strange. The pavement outside the car is damp and glistening with the amber light of the streetlamps, and I can tell by the way he's angling himself that Patrick Devine is going to kiss me tonight and it will be my first kiss and I'm so nervous I can barely breathe. I'm outrageously oversensitive all of a sudden in my fourteen-year-old excitement that I become hyper-aware of each precise movement of his, the smell of the pavement, the glint of the streetlamps, and the cool condensation on the insides of the car windows. I can't think clearly. And we're so young and so ungainly, ungraceful; but then his hand is in my hair and his lips are on mine and he tastes like gummy penguins and good God, it's heaven. I don't even care that five people are staring at us, I'm kissing him back like it's my job. Like I can't even help the fact that I'm tangled up in his fleece and the seatbelt and a canvas tote bag I got on vacation with my parents when I was eleven. Like I'm fourteen and kissing a boy for the first time and it's the beginning of summer and I'm finally tasting freedom and while at other times it tastes like other things, now, right now, it tastes like candy.

Llama is laughing so hard that she can't breathe. In fact, we all are. This is a night during a short, beautiful, perfect time that five of the best women in the world and I are getting together and eating dinner on the floor of a tiny cottage in southern Massachusetts. I am 22 and college is almost finished. We are drinking too much wine and we are eating too much food and we are talking until we are crying. And this is real crying, sometimes. This only happens a handful of times, but it <i>seems</i> to happen every weekend. When Abby laughs, she snorts. Maura's laugh is a high-octane explosion from which few survivors walk away unscathed. Sara is tiny, but when she laughs she has to stand up and run around because the sheer force of her giggles actually sends her muscles into uncontrollable spasms. And when Lizard laughs on this night, I swear her long dreadlocks are standing electric on end, and her wild tribal mouth will open big enough to eat the entire Western Hemisphere. Whenever we join together to cook and to feast and to talk about love, we unleash an energy that is ultimately not very far-reaching, but that is wholly holy in its own way. I am sitting on the floor and one of us is talking about her last relationship and then suddenly we are all talking at once and none of us can hear the others and it's a raucous cacophony of advice and sympathies laced with lewd innuendos and laughter too, and then we all stop at the same time to let the others speak and there is silence for one moment. We are all looking at each other, wondering who will be the first, but no one pipes up. And we just sit. How many times have you just <i>looked</i> at the people you love? There are so many nights I've cried with these ladies for so many different reasons, but on this night I hold that back and just look at each of them and love them. And then the yell-talking starts up again and it's great and beautiful and perfect. As it always is and as it should be.

I'm 23. It's late September or early October. I'm leaning against the cheap metal frame of an open window on an overnight train running between Provence and Venice. I'm exhausted and slightly sunburned after a weekend in the south of France where I spent much of my time reading a novel about India while lying on the rooftop of the cheapest hotel in town. So my skin is crackly. But the air coming in the window is cool against my face, and it helps. The guy next to me is only 19, from Croatia, and I want to call him Marco, but I'm not sure that's his name. He is leaning against the same window frame and he is telling me about his little brother who will meet him at the train station in Trieste and he will give him the guitar he bought in Morocco and they will drive home to Croatia. I understand most of what he is saying, but not all of it, so I just nod and smile a lot. He knows my game, but it makes him laugh, so we don't pursue it. Megan, my traveling companion, has gone to bed in the tiny bunks we have to sleep in, but there is a Frenchman in the bunk above her and he is talking angrily in his sleep, so Marco and I stay up while the train crawls along the Mediterranean. The train is hugging the seacliff walls, and it is going so very slowly that as soon as its path curves closer inland, we reach our hands out the windows to stroke the long green leaves of trees we are passing. Italian trees, we realize, as the train continues. They are night-damp and unremarkable, but in my exhausted wanderlust mind they are magical, and I cry a little when Marco isn't looking. I don't know why, but my heart loses itself so easily with leaves and strangers at nighttime.

I am so stoned that I feel like I'm speaking in tongues. I think earlier I might have been dancing to reggae, but I'm not sure. It doesn't matter anyway. All that matters is that Jon McBee and I are fake-driving a fake car around our college campus, and he is in the driver's seat honking a fake horn outside our friend's dorm. It's junior year and we just had a late-night study session for our Astronomy class, and now we're pantomiming a Sunday drive at midnight on an early spring weeknight. He stops the fake car at a stop sign and channelsurfs the fake radio, finally selecting the Classic Rock station which is playing Zeppelin's Immigrant Song, a capella of course... suspiciously in Jon McBee's voice. After looking in both directions, he fake-shifts the car into drive and we head to the back corner of campus where we find a midget magnolia tree in bloom. It had been raining earlier in the day, so the tree is a bit damp, but still we leave the car by the roadside and sit under it. He tells me secrets, and then I squat next to him and rustle a magnolia branch to feel a couple of raindrops fall on my face. And he stops talking to turn and shake the small tree trunk until the white petals fall all around us like we're in the very center of the most gentle beautiful snowstorm. Ever."

Happy Birthday Abby!

<lj-cut text=""Here's your 'Year Ahead' Horoscope..."">
Your birthday this year occurs shortly after a New Moon, suggesting a time of new beginnings and fresh energy. You are instinctively starting a new phase in your life. It's time to give your life a makeover and to branch out into the untried.

Uranus transits sextile to your Sun this year, and the desire to make a few changes in your life that break you out of your usual routines is with you. These changes are unlikely to be jarring or dramatic. Rather, it feels good to break out of your shell a little and to take a few healthy risks. Friends or group associations may be catalysts for this new self-expression. You may make little changes to your personal appearance or to your mannerisms that reflect the changes going on inside. A desire to be more free-spirited is with you this year.

With Venus in a tense aspect to Uranus in your Solar Return, some disruptions in your friendships and attachments are possible this year. Unusual attractions (to people and things) can have you acting on a whim. You may deal with freedom versus closeness issues in your relationships. It may be that you experience sudden changes or breakups with a friend or lover. However, the chance of a sudden new friendship is just as likely. At the root of this is a stronger taste for the unusual. What is familiar is less exciting to you than what is new and different. If a relationship seems to threaten your sense of freedom, you may have an easy time separating from it. Some fireworks in both your social and financial lives are to be expected, keeping things fresh and exciting. The best way to handle this energy is to open yourself up to the need for change in your love life or with regards to how you spend and make money--or both. Get in touch with this need for new experiences and/or attitudes so that changes are not forced upon you.

Mars opposes Pluto at the time of your birthday, adding quite a bit of intense energy to your year. You have powerful, transformative energy at your disposal this year, and much will depend on how you handle it. Channeled positively, you could move mountains when it comes to pushing your projects ahead. If mishandled, however, you could be argumentative, stressed, and hell-bent on having your way! Avoid taking extreme measures to make things happen your way, and avoid people who might be doing same. Deliberately trying to maneuver things in order to get the upper hand will be a lesson in frustration.

With Mars trine the Moon's North Node, you may be actively involved with teamwork and collaboration with others this year. This can also indicate an increased need for sexual union, as it stirs the passions and generally indicates ease in satisfying one's desires through positive connections with others. This aspect is one indication of getting engaged, married, the beginning of a significant new relationship, or the intensification of an existing romance. Jupiter in creative aspect to Uranus suggests that an enterprising spirit this year can really take you places. Sudden opportunities for advancement in different areas of your life appear. At the heart of this is your ability to recognize and capitalize upon opportunities and potentials. Fortunate events occur as a direct result of your willingness to entertain the unusual and to think outside of the box.

Jupiter harmonizes with Saturn at the time of your birthday this year, suggesting a period of constructive accomplishment. In general, you are practical, realistic, and your judgment is especially sound--and you derive much satisfaction from practical accomplishment. The key to harnessing this wonderful energy is to identify and find pleasure in the simple things that make you happy. A nice balance between optimism and practicality is with you this year.

The year ahead marks a significant turning point in your life, as you begin a new cycle. Your personality is sparkling, and you are more willing than usual to express your more unique qualities. New connections are made that enhance your social life. However, romantic ups and downs are likely as you struggle with issues of personal freedom. More involvement with groups enhances your life, and the ability to find a balance between optimism and practicality helps you to achieve your goals.


2008 is a Number Four year for you. Ruled by Uranus. This is a year of work and development. It's ""nose to the grindstone"" time. It's a time to deal with practical matters, and it's not a time to be lazy or especially gregarious. Sometimes, it can be a year that feels hard, monotonous and routine, and/or lonely. Advice - get yourself organized, work to build your resources, keep busy.

2009 will be a Number Five year for you. Ruled by Mercury. This is a year of exploration and freedom. It's a time when exploration and reaching out to others brings opportunities. It's a good time to advertise and sell. Surprises are in store, and the routine is broken. This is a year when exciting relationships can be formed, or, if you are already in a partnership, new life is breathed into the relationship. Advice - explore, look for adventure, keep your eyes open for opportunities, mingle.

I love you, honey. Happy 27th Sicker Nickertons."

"event","<b>Honoring the Fangirl Within</b>
So, I've never really been a bigtime fangirl. I've definitely nursed intense little obsessions with artists and actors and musicians and films and books, etc. But instead of getting involved in communities or writing fan letters or following a band on the road, I've just felt pretty private about those little obsessions. And maybe that's because it makes me a little nervous to put that kind of adoration out there. I don't know. But the psychological history of that doesn't really matter, because today I would just like to say that I have a new obsession, and I'm a little embarrassed (read: totally embarrassed) about it, but I just need to share anyway.

It all started with a little buzz around Barnes and Noble. A few people here and there mentioned that they were reading a Young Adult series about vampires, and that these were some of the best Young Adult books out there... next to Harry Potter, naturally. I sort of didn't really listen at first because I'm really not usually into fantasy as a genre, and, I hate to admit this closed-minded prejudice, I was suspicious of ""Young Adult"" fiction. But this vampire series spread through Barnes and Noble like absolute <i>wildfire</i>, and suddenly <i>everyone</i> of <i>all ages</i> was reading it and they were all literally <i>freaking</i> out. So, I picked up <i>Twilight</i>, the first book by Stephenie Meyer, and, as everyone had predicted, fell completely in love. I mean, this is some delicious stuff. It's young love, sweet and salty at the same time, but it's also this whole vampire thing and it's very emotionally complex at times, and at other times it's just hilarious and lovely. The characters are absolutely captivating-- so much so that I feel like I <i>saw</i> one of them in the New Age section at Barnes and Noble. I know. Ridiculous. But I just can't help it because I'm obsessed. 

So, what I really need is for those of you who have read this series to TELL me you've read it and tell me I'm not insane to be so ridiculously in love with the books. AND I'm hoping some of you who are a little curious about this MIGHT just run out and get a little copy to check it out yourself. I mean, I'm just sayin'... it's pretty awesome. Fun sexy brain candy. It ain't Dickens, but it's pretty great. Hopefully more of you will get sucked into obsession and you won't just think I'm lame and ridiculous. Lily Fox, no need to go looking for the book if you're feeling piqued... I just went ahead and mailed you a copy today. Because I just felt that I needed to. You can always give it away if it's not your cup of tea. :D

Oh, and for the Harry Potter fans out there... <i>Twilight</i> is being made into a film this year, and the kid who played Cedric Diggory in the movies (IMDB site <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1500155/"">here</a>) is going to be playing the romantic lead in this one. The vampire lead. Awesome.

<b>Nervous: The System</b>
I'm learning a new technique now in massage school... Neuromuscular. It's a deep tissue technique for the back and the abdomen that repatterns the nerves and muscles in the body's core. It's intense, and we have to study Neurology while learning how to perform each required movement. It's incredibly precise in both the movements themselves, but also the direction in which you perform them, the position of your feet, and the pressure of your thumbs. Because it's fortifying and retraining nerve paths, you could say that every movement changes the body's orientation in time and space. And once we get better and more fluid with each of the movements, we'll begin to incorporate energy work into the massage as well, moving energy out of old nerve pathways, and guiding energy into the nerve pathways we've opened and cleared. But furthermore, the musculature really takes a beating with this technique. I mean, I had to <i>pulverize</i> this girl's IT band the other day at school. It was amazing to feel that tangled, threaded connective tissue snapping tight under my thumbs."

"event","I pressed ""Post Entry"" a couple of minutes ago knowing exactly what I wanted to write. But the moment I was actually faced with an empty text box, I lost all of the words that had been swirling in this cavernous head of mine. All I'm doing is bobbing my head to the beat of this Talib Kweli tune, and swinging a clog off the end of my left foot, staring bleakly at this computer screen. 

I started flipping through <i>The Artist's Way</i> the other day. I had been thinking I should start focusing on writing again in a real way, and so I decided maybe I would follow that ""preeminent inspirational text's"" advice and do some of its exercises. You know, stretch the old writing muscles. I can only say it seemed like a good thing at the time, and now I know I was obviously suffering from a momentary bout of optimism regarding my schedule and basic syntactical abilities. Which is to say that I've never been a fast writer, and I've never been a committed one either. So when, upon cracking open said volume of <i>The Artist's Way</i>, I read that Julia Cameron actually expected me to write three pages of stream-of-consciousness per <i>day</i>, I decided that God granted me an iBook for good reason; namely, that I remain ""Blogger at Large"" for basically ever. 

And I'm really fine with that.

Because I have no idea what I would write otherwise.

I'm obsessed with a new song that I really think pretty much every woman reading this should check out... ""Thundah"" by Alison Hinds. It's pretty delicious. It's soca, and it's sexy. Basically, it's straight from Barbados, and it has your name on it. It's 99 cents. Buy it, it's so worth it.

I got a sweet package in the mail from Kit Fox today containing a hilariously lovely, square-shaped, secondhand graphic novel by <a href=""http://bralph.com"">Brian Ralph</a>. It looks like <a href=""http://bralph.com/images/portfolio/comics/comic_8.gif"">this</a>. It was wrapped in comic book wrapping paper. Because that's how my girl rolls. Many thanks, sister.

I'm such a freaking mess, you guys. Seriously. When Sabrina Ward Harrison wrote <i>Messy Thrilling Life</i>, I think she was imagining a messy life like mine. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm kind of loving these ups and downs and tricks and thrills. I'm at least learning to roll with the punches. It's a good lesson, I think, no matter when or how you learn it. My water bottle is smeared on one side with some nameless beige-ish batter from the bakery, and my green clogs are spattered with oversteamed 2% milk. I have Mod Podge crystallized between two fingers of my left hand and I can't find the transfer cord for my digital camera. I'm pretty sure my car insurance payment is two weeks late and I have no idea what that black thing at the back of the fridge used to be, but I'm afraid to poke at it because I'm fairly certain it has a pulse now. But, like, it's cool. I'll just lure it out of the fridge with something equally smooshy from the ""Crisper"" (by the way, there <i>is</i> an expiration date on ""crispiness"" when it comes to fresh produce, just in case you weren't sure or were on the fence about that one) and the two of them together can squish off into the sunset. Because everyone deserves love. 
Love on, furry rotting fridge dwellers. Love on."

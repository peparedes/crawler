Got to go get showered in 5 min and get to work-training.  Be at Castle Hill at 11:45.   I want to see Jany and give her a present I got for her as she was the one I miss alot and I guess I do still and always will even if it's not allow to show at my will."

"event","Today I had my first encounter with the FTM meeting group.  I didn't feel very comfortable at first and although it got a bit better, I was still not comfortable.  I like keepin' to myself but then I get so sad and wish to see and be able to smell Jany.  I am not a lesbian and I guess that was always an issue that Jany did not got the chance to understand very well for we didn't get to spend enough time knowing each other.  We were just in love with each other and we were just two individuals whome loved spending all the time we can together.  Somethings I never told Jany was that she scared n' hurt me but i couldn't tell.  I didn't know how... cuz' i felt confused and it hurt really bad.   I felt scared and angry too at times and I too wish I didn't have to feel that way.  I want to be the person I could be comfortable living as n' also be proud of.  To most the idea of me becoming a real boy or man is fucked up and wrong.  And that's what hurts me alot but dunno how to tell them nor explain although i always wish I know of a better way to put my mind into words n' without feeling so overwhealmed but I am still figuring out the way.  Soon we should get there.  It hurt and angried me that the person i want to be or really am makes the girl i love and want delicate my life to say things like.  ""IF i want a man.  I'll get a real man.  I wouldn't want someone like you""   :'(   But honey.. I feel all the love in me for only you.  Would you ever get to know that well?   I really dunno.  only time can tell.  I realized that I fell for the other girl's attention and started talking to her more.  She said onething that made me happy and went crazy for awhile.  She said.. ""No matter what you are or want to be.  I will always be attracted to you""        I wish those words could have came from Jany instead but it was someone else who I don't or didn't love at all.  

That's not all i've realized or know.  I also know my babygirl must have suffer alot being with me for people ask questions like..""are u a girl or boy?""   Or look at me weird which also wonder about her cuz' she was the lover by my side, my dearest partner.  It probablly hurt her more than it hurt me that she couldn't present me to her whole loving family and important friends in her life while having me as the person called a lover.  I understand or I try my best to see through it for I always knew it must have been hard on my hunnie and I just wanna make her happy and feel peacful while having me by her side.  

I know it's not easy to have me as a partner.
I am trouble also.
Althought i am not totally faithful and honest but I am doing the best I can, the best i can recall on.  I didn't or am not trying to embarrass anyone I love.  All i am doing, is bein' or at least tryin' to be real to myself.   It hurts so much to want to be all alone while missing everyone else.   I might be the best lover of this world for I know and feel this love in me is crying but its not weak cuz' it's gettin' strong.  The pain I felt sends tears streaming down my eyes and it's wot i call tears of trying to be stronger and better than what I do know of.   The rain comes and goes just like my round tear drops."

"event","Woke up on the bean bag in the living room.  I think an hour ago.  Using kev's laptop again.  My computer's fucked up again cuz' there's a retarded operator on it all the time when it's on.  

I had a dream before I wake.  Dreaming of jany, her gf was there so was this other girl.  It was a confusing dream.   I'm glad I got to see my boo, even if it was just in the sleeping dreams.   What does pain feel like in the dream?  Sawing something i never want to see in this life time, my heart was so hurt.  Just a dream dat had me waking up slowly, thinking of her.  I miss my love like crazy, and I am still weak but tryin' my best to be strong.  Everyday when I wake all I really wanna do is to go see the girl I love.  But I get scared, scared of making her unhappy and upset.  All I want to do is to marry this girl and have a happy family.  And if I can't have that then I must be on my way creating something that will take alot of lonely time to achieve.  I've got a dream of becoming someone since I was a little kid.  The person i want to become is not a scary or bad person but Jany and my family, will not like it nor will they be proud of me but think I'm wacked in the head or just selfish and insensitive towards the one who truely cares for me and love me.  I think I might be a big fool which try to comfort myself, saying i'm okay and all good when I get all blazed.  Trying to smile and live on to make everyday worthwhile but the harder I try the deeper my pain.  I need to be unattached to everyone and everything that I love n' know.  Just a dream I have since I was a little, is what i'm thinking of holding on.  After that I can be a person and be normal.  go to work, play with friends, talk to people, meet people, dance, sing, swim, go out into the world being n' living as the person i'm proud to be, knowing how to love myself well.  I wish I have Jany to share my life with cuz' she's the only one I want and can think of.  I love that girl so much.  I'd do anything for her.  I want to marry her now and build a home with her.  Jany's the one.  Knowing that the person I want to be in unattractive to most of the world.  Cuz' I'm a really short person and that means I will also be one of the short man moving about in this world.  

I've got my appointment booked with the consellor on the 2nd of may.  Gender clinic is where i will be going.  Think i want to see a shrink and find out wot i can do with myself.  I'm going for a change.  Dun wanna move back to taiwan cuz' that also means i can't become the person i want for another I dun know how many years.   And if i stay here.  I will have almost no-body but myself and maybe a dog.  Dun even know if my family will ever wanna see me or know me again.  I am too scared to hope, for hoping doesn't help.  It's doing the right thing that does to me.  Dat's why i dun like to hope n' hope.  Cuz' to me there's no point in hoping.  Hope doesn't get me anywhere and I saw that pretty clearly and well.  I've hoped all my life and it hurts to hope with no result or no resolution.  I'm so scared but i can't tell anyone cuz' nobody cares for me in that way anymore.  I'm a freak which no-one that surrounds me wanna really get down to know.  I feel so hurt.  I want to grow up being a kid at heart n' learn to be on my own and make my dreams come real.   I want to stay in Sydney and i'm so scared of the pain and confusion that will be the result of this  road I choose to take.  I dunno if i'm strong enough to take that.. i'm really scared.  I seem to cry on every Sunday morning that has been passing by me so quickly since you were gone and I try my best to wipe my own tears away n' it hurts so bad.  Why do i cry?  Boi's don't cry.  And yet i do.  A flock of crows were flying above the sky and making so much noise.  I wonder what the event is..  Alot of them came out together today, even the babie ones.  Just hope that their home isn't chopped down or burnt away, that'd suck for anyone or any animal.  It's life?   It is.  I wish myself could be more gentle as well.  I'm practicing that alot and i dunno if i'm dealing with it the right way or not cuz' when I start to think about my dreams and my life.  Breaking down in tears and having a busted runny n' half stuffy noise but I can't no-one and I dun want anybody to know.  Only I know how much it hurts but no matter how much it hurts.  I dun ever wanna take practice in the art of selfishness.  But i guess I am trying my best to learn n' understand the art of selflessness.  The empty life.  Maybe after i become a real boy I can join the Monks somewhere.  I dunno.   Gotta admit I often think bout it tho' when I do think deep of wot i wanna do n' be.   What will make everyone happy?   Be good for everybody.  I'll turn 26 soon.  I want my dream to come real even if it's later than 26.  Even if i have to leave.  I still want to marry my Misty boo n'  love her well for the rest of my life..  I'm gonna marry the world's most gorgeous princess, j.l. .. someday."

"event","Fuck this..  Maybe i shouldn't have look into her cell phone.   The pic of her hugging that other girl... who does not even look attractive to me.   Fuckin' hurts like hell.   My babie hugging somebody else and taking it down as memories to keep.  Moments she treasure.   Should i smile or cry?   supposing she's happy either way..   with or without me.   I smile and i cry.   This is so much pain..  and i'm all alone.  I don't want to cry anymore.  I don't want anyone to hear me crying or see me cry again.   This is so hard.   :'( cannot breathe again.  How long would i have to wait?   I watched this Indian movie just now..  and in there a woman told another woman ""the greatest union of two lovers is not lust but total trust""   I agree..  I wonder what Jany thinks about that.  Asking her when she comes over at around 12pm.. will do that.  

So where do i belong?   I don't feel wanted here..  Mom wants me back in Taiwan and she loves me.   Dear called up so many times today.  He sounded super disappointed as he asked me when will i go be back in BKK?   It's suppose to be about now.   Had to tell him i got a change of plan..   Wanna stay for this short movie which i'm involved in producing it.  BUt that's not really why..    just wanna spend more time with my babie and i miss her like crazy.   Feels like yesterday has been a long whiie.  Missing Jany, knowing something i wish i never have to find out.   I feel like a fool.   I am a fool.  My babie let me become a fool?   :'(     Jany said ""go with the flow.. know what u want and just go for it""   So what does she want?   Go for it!  sure.. what about responsibllity and moral.   It's alright to go with the flow if one's mind is strong and healthy.. leading one to the destination from their journey.  So where da fuck does one flow to when their body, mind and soul is all outta pace?    What about harmony?    I feel that with Jany.   But what's going on...   am i being played?   :(   I want to sleep.  Feel like throwing up.   Man this is so tiring...    Damn..Fucke me sidewayz!!!  ""life is harsh""      So what?  Get over it!   Harsh so what???   There are others that are worse and not cared for out there.  WHo the fuck cares???  LIfe is what u Make it!  Life is Harsh???   so deal with it...?    Yes...  it's easy when to say that when one stand in their own shoe.   Man..  Love is love man..   She did me wrong and i know she's still doing it.   But i tell myself not to think that...  cuz' that's not what Jany says.  Or i didn't ask..  I dun't know..   maybe that's a good idea ..   will do that!    but ever time i see her.. i forget about everything.   I just wanna spend good time with her and make her happy.  But i got off the car not so happy..  but i was broken from the inside out.   I try to smile.   She didn't look happy..  but it didn't seem like she thinks much about it..  didn't mention a thing.   Very slippery...  DOn't know what she's up to.   All i know is..  my babie's gone to see Mel again.  she lied to me.  The pic proved it.   They weren't in the phone the last time i checked when i went over to her place.   Is this love???   Does she really love me and care for me?   Doesn't she need me anymore?     maybe she doesn't ... but fuck!!  what if she does?   I'm scared to leave her alone.   I care so much for her i'm worried..  i want all the best for my girl.  I want to give her the best of me..     I feel like shit.   Feel degraded...   niglected, betrayed, rejected, and the thing is still feeling so much love and i'm so scared to hate.   Experiencing a rollercoster ride.. going up and down.. a ride of emotions.   Going though them faster than i go through sweets is burning me out.   But man..     I can take it so why does it feel like Jany just want me to hate and show her so.  She just want me to scare her away...  I don't know what she wants..  i wish i do.   Where are the answers to all my questions?   I'm going insane trying to answer them all by myself.      When will problem be solved?    How long will this take?    wondering what if I only got 6 months to live.   Wonder is she'd  care and be different..  and if so.. why?    or if Mel's got the same 6 months thing ..  what would she do?    and what if we both got it.   So what is she going to do?    I wanna know.   I have so many questions but i'm the only one asking and answers come back short anywayz.   I want my babie girl!    miss angelo and killer ..wishing all my friends are around.   I miss them all.."

"event","Met jany for a little bit.. she came over after work and we had KFC together.  She was starved.   On the way home.. we parked at the carpark across from home.  Checking out her phone..  i saw pictures that turned me off.    :(  eww...   I feel so sad and miserable.   Wondering if she cares..      I guess not.    Wish things were different.   This is ripping me apart from the inside.  I feel my heart squeezed tight.   I feel so cold... where is my fire?     Where do i Stand and for what reason am i doing so?   I know all my reasons... but I am kinda sick of lying to myself now.  Wanting to trust and trusting the girl i love is actually hurting me more than i could ever imagine letting someone do this to me.   Why?   It's killing me and i feel like i'm gonna die...   don't know if i'll ever wake up sometimes..    I wish she was here through all those sleepless nights when i tremble and cry my self bind ..  falling asleep, getting so tired from all the crying and the use of energy in thinking and doing.    My heart feels like there are million of tiny needles stabbing into it right now.  It hurts but i can't do anything about it.   They were hugging in the pictures ..in the phone i gave my babie.  A present from me to her.    Should i go?   I really don't know..  does she still need me?   I can only wonder.   I am scared to ask so many things now.  She sounds annoyed and so impatient .. even cynical sometimes.  And at other times.. she's just a sweetie pie.   Maybe i'll have to let her learn her own way.... I still think me and her are meant to be.   But Why is she doing this to me?   I'm hurting myself..   she's only hurting me cuz' i'm letting it happen.  I ain't a fool.  I do love myself and i am sorry that i'm doing this to myself.  But i think maybe this will all be worth it..  anything would be worth to do to make her a happy successful woman who stands strong no matter how hard the times are..  or how hard the falls which makes her hit the floor.  Walk on..   I will too....   when i and my love is doomed.   I will have to force myself to leave destiny.  hoping that day will never come.     I still love her but i don't ever want that to have to change....   will she come back to save 'us'?    or am i already alone..   I wish i know......  but i just wonder..  for now anywayz.    Hope she's having lots of fun with her friends at lytha's.   I'm so confused.   So.. everyone are friends..  Jany, Mel, Lytha, Jocelyn.   I don't know what's going on here.  My headache.    wondering... aren't i important anymore?  feels like i don't mean shit.   I feel so worthless as Misty allows me to feel.   But i know i'm not.   I'll stay for as long as i can and when i am certain that I'm not the one anymore.. I'll go.   She says she still love, care, miss and want me.    when that change again.    I'll have to let her have what she calls satisfaction and happiness in her life.   I love her immensely.   How do i stop loving when i don't want it to stop at all.   I really don't know.   it's a myth.   i'm sticking around to live it til the end....  where are the answers to all my problems???    where's jany?    ???   Giving her happiness while loving +caring and looking out ..being there for her..are things i want to give.   I wish someone would want to give me the same i'm giving her.   And i want that someone to be Jany.     Am i in trouble?   How do i get outta it?    Fix it!    I will!  At least.. i'll try my very best cuz' jany is worth more than anything to me."

"event","Jany is my girlfriend.   One day i got bored and logged on the Mirc and checked out the lesbian chat room (things i've never done in life)  I was a beginner in the whole chatting thing.  Didn't really know what i was doing.  But i found this girl crying.  Or she found me as she was crying.  She asked me if i wanted to go for a ride.. driving around with her.   She felt lonely.   And she needs love.  I wasn't sure if it that person could be me or not.  She called me up that nite and my heart beated the way it never did.. and the weird thing is .. It's only a girl from online.   Why was my heart thumping like that.. i still don't know.  I didn't even knnow her.  And i talk to stangers all the time and my heart never did that to me.  I wonder why..  or how come.    ANd when i picked up the phone.. i hear the most beautiful sound on earth.   jany's voice carried me away.   She sounds so gentle, sexy and so soft.  i fell in love with her voice.. Seeing her was my mission.  And she helped me complete it by coming to see me at Broadway shopping center that day.  This girl walks up to me as i walk up to her and gave her a handshake.  I've never met anyone off the met nor hook up with strangers before.   But this one got me bad!  The one and only.   She took my heart away as she listens to me talk and smile.. looking at me.   MIsty is like an angel..  angel that's sent down from heaven for me.  After all that talking she got tired and decided to lay down on my bed and rest her eyes.   There is a boat.. with a pretty girl sitting on the docker of bay, all alone, she was playing with sand.  She was trying to hold love the way she was holding sand.  The high pressure from the hold..holding on to a hand full of sand so tightly..not wanting any to fall out. Sand leaks out of the little tiny gaps in between those pretty fingers as she holds it tighter.  She asked me ""What is love?""  I'm not so sure if i qualify to be the interpreter or nor the conductor of the love review.    I'm still learning..   My love is still developing..  maybe when i die then what i say or write here about love can be shown to her.  Lot of time .. people don't realize the love they have ...standing right in front of them and wanting to love and be loved.....   Wanting the person I love to be happy and healthy means more than my own happiness as i did give myself up to my other half.  I did what i said.. therefore i am who i am.     man.. Love is Love! Love is a myth. it's a mystery.  Just like death or life.     Any how.. The boat is filled with the world's yummiest ice-cream and sweets.. so, i asked the girl if I could join her, bringing along my yummy ice-cream to share, offering to show her how to hold that hand full of sand, dropping the smallest amount possible.  She looked into my eyes, smiled and said ""okay""    so We went on board, sailing off eating our ice-cream together in happiness and when we get to the shore we both try holding the sand in our hand..  sometimes she holds on too tight and i remind her of how it could be held.  I too..forget sometimes.  she then reminds me of how things should be.  Sometimes on our journey things happen..  weather change, it storms, we have each other..  and sometimes the rainbow comes after the rain.  The beauty is amazing.. and being with my girl as we share the hard times and the moments of rainbow together.  It's my treasure..  moments@#!   i value beautiful things especially those ones that have happened to me.   The journey goes on..   I battle with the bad weather, what ever that hurts my babie or gets in our way.  I will stand up for my destiny.   Won't let it slip by and tell myself..   ""u could have done better.""   I know i can make her happy and i want to be the one to satisfy her wants and needs... hoping she'll let that be me as i surrender myself..  i got nothing to offer ..  all i have to offer is my compassion and my companionship, my love, what i'm made out of.. just the simple but complicated, me."

"event","I just got up..  couldn't really sleep.  I am so tired.   Jany will be coming over in a while.  Going to drop jay off and buy something for sis at the BP station.   That day on the 11th of Sep 2001 I got caught by beauty, i couldn't take my eyes off her and i don't even want to fall asleep.  I fell in love the way i Never did.  ANd over time...it grew so deep.  It's only been 2 yrs and that's not even clost to long enough for me.  I don't ever want to take my eyes off her.   Jany babie's just gone some where  (hang up the phone early, buzzing and feeling like i am being annoying cuz there's no answer at lots of times.  And no replies (used to be right away)  Things change but I am still the same.    The feeling of missing some1 sometimes kills.   I want to kiss her and carress her.  I want to hold her in my arms and i love it when she holds me in hers.   I feel so happy as the sensational feelings she gave me is more than just touch and kisses.  They are moments I never want to forget nor let go.  I tell myself.. ""stop wondering""  i want to trust and i will do so.  ANd if anything ever happens i'll only have myself to blame for being a fool.   I hope my babie will come save me from that fall...  how do u blame others and move on thinking i'm better..   I don't know how.   I want the ones i love to be a better peson than myself.  Or i want to at least try and make that person better cuz' At least that's what i want to believe and it makes me happy knowing so.  I do not want to be proved wrong.  I am not perfect!  And no one is..  it hurts me to know or feel that i've lost the biggest part of me.   I wonder if she's happy with me..  what about her?   Does she miss her?   would she cry cuz' she misses her and want to be with her but can't...     i just want my babie to be happy...   I want her to feel loved and I don't want anyone to hurt her...  she's my babie and I treasure her.  She's a part of me..   ever since that day on the 8th of Sep 2001 @ Broadway Shopping Mall *I looked into an angel's eyez*   Angel came with me and showed me love..  That day and ever since then ..Every time i looked into Misty's eyes(the deeper i fall), as she smiles or cry(hugging me and telling me the things dat goes on inside her), as she speaks (her beautiful lips lets out my favorite sound on earth), Her eyes are so warm and welcoming..  Jany makes me hot!  I get all sweaty just thinking about her and when she does come around.. she makes me sweat.   She's my babie.   ""Hun..what's your FanTaSy?"" jany asked.    ^#@!$^&I know my fantasy are nothing like the ones she has..  Of couse i love sex and doing all kinds of fun things that envolves, good & interesting sex.   I love all that and i want that too.. but i don't consider that to be my fantasy as i know that's just something i can get cuz' out there there are people craving for sex 24/7.  BUt what i really want and fantasize about is being able to do that with Jany, the person i'm so in love with.  I want to be the one doing her constantly... i want to be the one to share everything she's got on her mind.. i want her to tell me everything she wants.  My fantasy is .. unusual i guess.  just want to be holding the same person i truly love from now til we get all wrinkleyy..  havin' less teeth and hair (hopefully not tho') :)  I want to be sharing with her my memories and those moments which she has accompanied me....ever since that day i met her on Mirc.  Being under the blanket and waking up next to the person I used to wake up to everyday.  That's my fantasy!   I don't want a new sexy girl everyday when i wake up.   I want my sexy jany babie to be the one i wake up to everyday.  I dream of sharing my life and being stable in having a relationship that's full of love and trust.  I wonder..  will there be that day .. the day that I don't feel so lonely .. the day that I know everything'd be okay when i go to sleep.   Will I ever get to wake up the way i did when I was still a little kid?   Think insomnia is eating me in now.  WHy is sleeping so hard to do now adays..  it's something i enjoy the most.  Getting my sleep!  Man.. what the hell's going on over here?     wish I know..  FUck! i'm so tired..  Better get showered.   Hoep today is another one which is filled with moments i would love to take down and keep as a movie record.   Only if i have my Dream Machine.. (that camera of mine which takes the infor from my brain and put those verbal or visual informationinto pictures on the screen) When will i get one?   I ain't no scientist.   Why didn't i become 1?  and if i did..  how would I accomplish my dream machine?  I want to invent the vision of mind recorder.  And be given a magic door or a time machine that's made by my friend.  It's just a fantasy that will not come true during this life time.  But maybe i wouldn't need any of those things when I'm announced dead.  Maybe there are greater and more of those beautiful creations outthere.   I don't fuckin know.   Gotta get ready now.   My boo will be coming over soon..  Shower time!  I am getting so damn hot thinking bout her.. rubbing me, touching and kissing me, talking to me with the world's most sexy voice.  Man.. can't wait to see my babie.   I want to give her some lovin'.. speanding quality time together doing ..anything.   I miss her so much.  Hope she'll put me back to sleep someday.   At the mean while get up and keep moving!  Man..  this diary thing is addictive.  ANd i'm super slow at doing things.   :)  maybe i'll become quicker.   practice makes perfect..   what's my perfection?  How good can I get?   and how bad could i get if i decide to live my life the other way?     Search!!!  Answers lays within somewhere.   Gotta be! Look harder and try my best or be doomed!"

"event","The real starting point of my blank paper for today.. and all the tomorrows i'll have.  I hope this livejournal thingy won't ever die before me.   My whole body aches and I've got insomnia.   I don't know what's going on..   I wish i could help myself.  I'm trying..   I'm lost.  But in the same time i'm found.  It's hard to explain.   I feel like crying.   I don't want to cry when there's no one to dry my tears for me.  I hate wiping my own tears off my face.  Tears of nothing but the love i've got.  It hurts.   Loneliness kicks in and sits inside me.  Where am I?  and what am I doing?   Where is my babie now?  I miss Jany like crazy..  i feel like she's gone or she's playing a mind game with me now adays.      *trying not to cry but :'(*  Where is my babie?  i've been up for months..  Tireness is killing me, my heart hurts when she's not around, i've been up for 6 months now.  So quick..  don't even feel that quick.   

I had to pay for my livejournal cuz' i want to have one.  I asked her for the code 3 tims cuz she gave me the link to this place full of space for my blank papers.  She didn't give it to me.  Said ""na.. nope"" and that made me want it more as it made me more curious.  She's got one and i know someone else has got one too.  They share their journals...  while i know.   Stay quiet..  cry.  Is this love?   What's gotten into me?   I am not blind...  i see beauty but i feel pain.  I miss her so much but i don't know what to say.  It seem like it's been so long .. how long has it been?  I couldn't even feel time...    for 3 months i've lost touch with time.  I'm still trying so hard to put myself back into time and into place.  I feel so outta place now.  Where is home?  Mom called today.. asked me if uni's done.  She questioned me..  when i'll be going home, why i'm not, wanted me to go back to Taiwan for work or at least for work experience.  I am so scared of leaving my babie alone as i know if i do know.. she'll be gone for i don't know how long this time.  Maybe forever...  i can't risk either.  I don't want to.  My heart breaks and it's already broken... into smaller and smaller pieces.  This is what love does..  breaks me in..  hurts.    When will it stop?  Maybe i should go.  I feel so lost.  There's no one for me to turn to.  Just me, myself, and i.  i'm scared but i tell myself ""don't be a pussy"" be strong.  But crying doesn't mean pure weakness ..or ..does it?  I'm trying to stay strong but i can't help myself when tears roll off my eyes and stream down my face..my heart is breaking from the inside.   But only i know.  :(  I try to smile.  I do!  I can't breathe  .. I need to get some air and get some rest.  But i'm not sleepy yet.   I feel so lonely and when i come to my bed.. i feel the coldness that sits in it.   Missing her .. loving her ..  is slowly burning me away.  I need to get back in time and feel everything again.   A zombie walking around isn't me.  doesn't she care anymore?   her mom, family, job, friends, mel, are important to her. She cares about all of them and she cares what all of them think.  ???How about me??   I feel so left out and neglicted.  Unwanted, rejected!   Am i that worthless?   Maybe i am to her I really am.   Time will tell.  i'll stay strong just like a ninja.  I'll take the pain.. give it to me babie!  Let me have it all!  Jany's good, Jany's bad... what ever it is.   I'll be a love ninja.   I am stuck in a moment i can't get out of.   I gatta get a chair.. my neck is killing me."

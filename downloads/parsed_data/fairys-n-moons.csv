my wonderful fiance has bought me a dell it is awesome!!!

My mom...
My mom has pissed me off.... she is upset b/c I do not treat her like chris's (my fiance) mom rose she thinks i do more for her for example she brought up ths past christmas when i bought for rose and not her. The truth is she hasn't done much for me she doesn't support me emotionally or financially. I have a lot of resentment toward her but if i tell her how i feel she'll probablly not want to talk to me ever again. Mom mom is ignorant, she doesn't like to see what's really going on or admit when she is wrong she always looks to someone else to blame. I love my mom don't get me wrong and i don't want to hurt her but i hate feeling like shit. Even though i shouldn't I can't help it.

School...
school is almost over thank god.I could say so much more but i leave it at that.

Work...
I hate my job, I need the money so i can't quit, I've been looking for another one for the past few months. Hopefully I'll get one soon.

Last time...
the last time i wrote i said something about my cousin being pregnant. I'll say this much, it is a boy, he is beautiful and healthy, but a little too small. She is having a tough time multi-tasking with the new edition at her side but hopefully she'll learn the tricks and hopefully she'll go back to school in the fall and work on getting out of highschool. 

Monday...
This past monday is was 80 out so me and a few friends went to the beach... cory is nuts(rollerbladed for about 2hrs staight) It was fun hanging out, I hope we can hang out durring the summer maybe 1 or 2 times every month time permiting

"event","alright last journal entry i bitched about my man this is the entry I tell you what a good man he is,
We've been together since 6/19/01 and engaged since 10/13/02. I've moved a total of 5 times since we've been together and along with moving there was alot of shit i had to deal with and he's been there for me every step of the way. from breaking up with my ex b4 we got together till the current shit i'm still going through now. He is not the mushy type or the type to flower me with gifts (we're both broje so we can't afford the gifts anyway) He does get mushy from time to time and he is very cute. He doesn't like going out alot but the time we spend together is fun anyway. I love him with all my heart and I know he loves me. I think when i get upset about shit it is just my insucurities comming out. When I moved in with him about a month ago i was worried because I didn't want him to feel that he had to give up everything (he is an only child) He took me moving in alot better than anyone thought. But to sum everything Up I just wanted to let you know that he isn't a piece of shit and he doesn't always make me upset. He is a wonderful guy I really lucked out.... After all we must be doing something right for have been together as long as we have."

"event","Today I worked from 7-2. Work is never fun, on to the next part of my day....
Today my Aunt and I had a baby shower for my 17 year old cousin who is about to have a baby. I feel bad for her but at the same time I have no sympathy. I feel bad for her because she can never go back and change what her life would be like if she waited. She is still in school and she thinks now that the hardest part will be giving birth. she is stuck with this little person till he is 18yrs old or even older. This child is going to go through so much and she has to go through life with him. I know she'll be a good mother, I am just scared for her, the baby, and, daddy. I'm in college and i don't think i could handle some little person's life being my responsibilty. But i guess many people have done it before and i know she can too.
My next problem....
I moved in with my boyfriend or should i say fiance about a month or so ago, now i can't help but think that i am a complete burden in his life, even though i clean the bedroom and do the laundry and pretty much do anthing for him. Last night, we were talking and he is upset b/c on saturday nights he has his friends over and drink and by 11 at night I shut them off and i want to go to bed b/c i have to get up early and go to work the next morning. That pisses him off because he can't do what he wants. Even though the same shit has been happening since i've started school. we've been together for 2 yrs and engaged for 1 I love him with all my heart and i don't want to loose him. I am sorry if i don't want to be up all night drinking when i have to work and do homework the next day. I am not like most college students I rather make some money to pay bills and actually do real well in school than party. I can party when i am doing something with my life. He has known that i am serious about making my life better he knows i don't drink and he still makes me feel like this. It's not like he makes me drink but i have to suffer b/c he wants to. I don't even know what to say or how to say this to him without pissing him off, He is difficult to talk to without making him feel like shit. He really is a great guy though .... thats a story for another entry"

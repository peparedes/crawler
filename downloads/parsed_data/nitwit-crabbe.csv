Okay, Now I'm going to do everyone's comments.

<i>Like oh my god that is SO gross.  Don't write anything like ever!.</i>

or

<i>I'm a snob and I never do anything disgusting or human because I'm smarter than you and I have a stick up my arse.</i>

If I wanted to hear from an arse, I'd fart.

<i>Like if you were someone else I'll actually talk to you like a human being instead of trying to insult you. tee-hee.</i>

Whatever.

I think Narcissa Malfoy tried to fuck me.  So, I don't know if I should send her a few galleons for the attempt?  I thought the Malfoy's were really well off.  

I lost ten pounds of fat and three inches on my stomach."

"event","The lot of you are perverts.  I talk about quidditch bludger balls and you all think i'm wanking.  Sick people.  I remember what my father said when people use to make fun of me because of weight.  It's like when you call someone cunt in the hallway, if they turn around then they are one.  You can choose be affected by words.  You chose how to interpret them, <i>you</i> give them meanings and power.  I was innocently talking about getting ready for my quidditch game and you all turned it into something disgusting.  I'm not going to give you the power to turn my sport into something sick and dirty.  <strike> It's the same way I don't let people call me fat anymore.  I'm not that fat right now though....and they stopped because I can beat the shit out of them too.</strike>

So I'm going to go <strike>smoke</strike> eat my dinner and play some quidditch by myself because the rest of you belong in St. Mungo's mental ward."

"event","I was beating today.  After I did my beating I polished my broom a bit.  Then my hand got really tired so I stopped and placed a charm so my broom got polished by itself.  I think I want to play with my bludger balls, but they can get out of control sometimes and I don't think Draco will want them whizzing around in dorm room.  I wonder if anyone else uses protection when they're slamming their balls around?  My father said I should use protection all the time to avoid accidents.  I told him I was only playing with myself so there shouldn't really be a problem.  He said I could blind.  I didn't understand him, but I guess if one of my balls got loose, I could get hit and go blind?  

Whatever.  

That dude's a ponce, I don't know his name but I think all guys wouldn't want him in the locker room if you know what I mean.  If I catch him sneaking a peek, i'll give him a pounding he won't forget.  BEATING. I'll beat him up like he's a third year....

ugh, I hate fags, they're just as bad as mudbloods."

"event","I'm getting fat again.  I can't really help it.  I start eating and I can't stop.  It's like a drug.  So I'm thinking of smoking my meals now.  With cigarettes.  <strike>I got a spelling correction quill this thime. ha!</strike> I'll get my fat turned in muscle by beating people up.  Yeah...I got a <i>good</i> workout today with this seventh year.  It felt good too.  My knuckles are still bleeding.

I'm hungry...

No...I want a smoke...

...I don't have any fags...I bet Malfoy has some. <strike>...okay that sounded very wrong.</strike>

um...my journal is broken."

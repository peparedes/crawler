"event","Yes Indeed I did it .. 
   I managed to shlack yet again .. I swear that THE CHEK is consuming me like crazy.. I have yet to go to the Clubs i so feel  out of touch wiht the Goth crowd.. I shall return.. I still think I need to upgrade my wardrobe tho .. I'm a tad out of date on that one. But its all good given that I am still losing weight I am thinking that  perhaps a size change is in order on certain items.. All Good I say!! No to seek out any and all single goth bois!!! I truly believe that they are all extinct.. I guess Imsn't give up hope huh? Nay I say ..I stil believe that there is always someone out there for every one.I guess jsu aslong as he is Tall Dark (as in blk hair) & slim( drools) or lean & muscular( swoons) its all good to me...
well I am not sure what more to ran about if need be I shall return!!!!

I have been away due to many rediculous hours put into work.. To be truthful Iam starting to wonder if my  puttiong forth aall this effort into my job is worth it at all? Sadly I have became the BASTARD CHILD of my work place.. Will this get me anywhere?? some how I doubt it!!! Sad to say its so not a Goth JOb..I am dying too Still seek employment in a Goth store. Esp if it will pay pretty well ...*Sways to TypeO* Goth Love the ever Sexy Pete Steele!!!
   Things are about to change for the comming Feb month!!! I plan to get into he sceme of things and get back in to some GOTh clubbing... its been way to long side given my weight loss Imay look better to some ppl..One can only  hope.. I jsut ned to very much up grade my  goth ware....its way too out dated...Then the vintage clothing show comming this spring I so can't wait..
       There needs to be  a stop to this dreadfull all work no play syndrome...There has to be someone out there for me...Most preferrably of the Gothic persuasion.. I mean is that at all possible? All Ihave  now is the vauge curiosoty of my Italanio  boss.. I have no right to even think  about him cause he;s a full out trophy hunter..Meh  I wont' even go on about him .. cos  I dont even rank inthe trophy hunters world !!* laffs hysterically* so its just the Hunt fot hot goth Bois*TIM Drools*

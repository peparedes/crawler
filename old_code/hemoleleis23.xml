&#xD;
joel funeral was so sad, as is all funerals. i had the worst wakeup call that morning, my grandma who raised me passed away, so it made joels funeral that much more painful. had to make an emergency flight to chicago,went to see her (private viewing), see looked peaceful and at rest so thats good. i think she was ready to go cuz she was suffering, its just a matter if we were ready to let her go. if youve ever seen the movie soul food, she was the big momma to our family. i visited my other grandma in the hospital today too. thank god shes doing ok tho, she even got released today. i dont think i can take another death any time soon. im barely hanging on as it is. i just got back an hour ago, our flight was delayed for 1 1/2...got snowed in. i still cant believe im moving there in a month. crazy.&#xD;
&#xD;
awww...im soo touched by the number of people who cared. asides from the obvious and usual friends i hang out w/, i was surprised to have sean and skuba call jill to see if i was ok. and joe and john were very thoughtful as well. its nice to know they care.&#xD;
&#xD;
on a random note i got a call from brian. i saw him at the alumni game and we started choppin it up, we used to be so close back in high school but drifted apart cuz of dans jealousy. yeah he called to ask if i wanted to have dinner, and hes gonna cook! haaay, i never turn down a free meal, and boys that can cook get mucho bonus points. we're gonna have dinner tomorrow nite, or actually tonite, we'll see how that goes. &#xD;
&#xD;
i love hanging w/jill, nette, sean, and skuba...theres just never a dull moment. they even came to support me in my semi-finals game (even tho we lost...boo...). seans athleticism has been rubbin off on me, we go to the gym more now and i actually run. yeah you read right, and we even ran for an hour straight! shocker. and i still wasnt tired! he just made it so much easier. theyre even coming to kickboxing w/ me next week. yay, that should be fun. i think me and skuba are getting a lot closer, we motivate each other and rub off on each other. he even comes and helps me out in my bball practices. too bad im moving, according to sean things would be so much different. but im enjoying my time with him, hes even gonna cook me breakfast this week or next week.&#xD;
&#xD;
well thats it for now. peace out ninjas.&#xD;

on monday went to the warriors game w/ eho...fun times, and mr.p and a few of my buddies. i rooted for the nets but they lost! boo!!!! it was so close! lost a bet w/joe so now i have to ask john out to dinner...dammit, i hope i dont have to pay.&#xD;
tuesday, went to skuba and seans alumni game at south city. &#xD;
today played alumni game @ec...we lost by 3! boo. at least i didnt do too bad, my knee is bruised but whatever i played my ass off. and now i just got home from playin 3 on 2 drunken bball w/jill, nette, sean &amp; skuba. we won. they now owe us dinner. too bad we werent drunk, but the guys had a good buzz. went to chill and ended up stargazing. ironic that me &amp; skuba were the only ones that caught a glimpse of a shooting star. hes just so nice to me and hes so funny. i swear the more we hang out the more hes startin to grow on me.&#xD;

FYI my phone is dead till this weekend, so if u call leave a message pls. &#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
H&amp;M's grande opening tomorrow...horray!!! me &amp; irene are SO there when the doors open. copped a harjuku lovers shirt (gwen stefanis line) @ urban...hella sick...hella expensive. $50 for a shirt hardly seems worth it but fuckit. these shopping urges need to stop. im a lil bitter that my mom is in sydney shoppin so i feel i have to compensate by buying everything in sight. this is a horrible disease. John practically had to kick me out of tilly cuz i had a sudden urge to buy a roxy suitcase, he saved me a good $170.&#xD;

on a better note, i got dress up my mom. it was hella fun, shes leavin on vaca and wants too look cute, and i told her i could make her look at least 15 years younger, and i did, so now she wants to go shopping! yay! shes losing a lot of weight, good for her, but im getting scared cuz she's slowly fitting into my clothes! yikes. but she raided my closet and found 2 pairs of pants, 2 sm jackets, a belt, 2 necklaces, and 2 shirts that she loved and wanted to borrow. it was fun, like i had a real life doll to dress up. hah. what sucks is that 1/3 of the things she borrowed is brand new, 1/3 i got within the last few months but have only used once or twice...she had a blast, now her new goal is to drop a size so she can fit into more of my clothes. she got hella excited cuz she felt as if she had a lil clothes/accessories/shoes/purses shop that is at her becking call, and the best part is that she doesnt have to spend any money. &#xD;
oh well, at least shes starting to take my passion for fashion more seriously, and highly encourages me to intern at a high style boutique in loyola like dolce &amp; gabbana, or versace...shoot you aint gotta tell me twice mama...i want it!!!!&#xD;

on top of all that she booked us a room at the very elegant Waldorf-Astoria hotel on park ave.!!! i was in awe, i walked in feelin hella underdressed. it must be my lucky summer or something cuz the hotel upgraded our room into a 2 hallway, 4 room, jacuzzi included suite. i felt hella big pimpin.&#xD;
to top it all off, i left for vacation finding out i was accepted into loyola w/ a $4000 scholarship, and came back finding out they messed up on my scholarship, it was increased to $10,000!&#xD;
so now my mom is even more ecstatic and shes tryin to take my out to boston this weekend for a lobster dinner and more shopping.&#xD;
&#xD;
yeah i'd say summer is VERY good to me this year. actually life has been very good to me the past 5 months. &#xD;

went surfing for the first time. im a bodyboarder but i think i found a new love. one of my next big splurge will be a surfboard. im actually pretty good at it, its just that im not too confident in my swimming abilities just yet. in time though. went shopping like a maniac in honolulu, it was frickin awesome. i swear to god it must be hawaiian water or something but they breed the finest men, ever. speaking of hawaiian men, i found me a good one, once i figure out how to put pix on this lj thing ill make a entry bout him.&#xD;

K.O.ing on a hammock, and surfing all day...now thats the life. id kill. the trip was pretty sweet, soo short tho (3 days). wish i couldve stayed longer...like forever. haha. flight sucked...extremely uncomfortable...8 hour flight from kona straight to chicago, in coach. i hate coach, unless its a purse or shoes.&#xD;
xango (co that i work for) paid for the room, transportation, luau and food...they big ballin. n plus a whole bunch of goodies, including 2 boogieboards!!! they won my heart. stayed in the Hilton Waikaloa Village resort close to Kona, in the Big Island. one of my favorite resorts in the world, its an adventure by itself. u have to take a tram or boat to your room, thats how big it is. simply gorgeous. did a whole bunch of activities in their lagoon n pool...snokeling (w/ huge hawaiian sea turtles), kayaaking, water biking, hottubin, tanning, luau (made me wish i danced hula again)... &#xD;
cant wait to come back. didnt get much shopping done because you gotta drive 50 miles from the resort to the next town, n we had no car. its coo tho, the fam is goin back to hawaii for my mamas bday in august. this time honolulu for a day to shop, then either maui (lahina) or kauai (lihue)for relaxation.&#xD;
now the sexy boys...pleasure overload! meliss, anne, n mae know wassup. damn i was like "holler at the bell boy!" the whole time. their employees are some mighty fine pieces of art. hawaiian-built...now thats how i like em!!! one of those fools bout to be my future baby daddy, and that aint no joke.=)&#xD;
&#xD;
well, peace out for now. im chillin in chicago for 3 days, then im off to orlando...disney world...haaay...&#xD;
time differences are confusin me, i dont even know what day it is...seriously. from sf time...hawaii=3hrs behind...chicago=2 hrs ahead...orlando=3 hrs ahead...headache...&#xD;

&#xD;
on a good note, if u read my last entry, the boy that i hit in my kick boxing class came back to class this morning. yay, at least i didnt scare this one off. the bad thing is that we fought again but this time i lost. not on purpose, i think he really prepared this time...or maybe it was those bottles of vodka i had last nite. either way i still lost. boo...but funny thing was now he chops it up like he knows somebody! also funny...we can leave class at anytime but he asked me what time i was gonna leave so i guess we could talk a little more. i told him 3:00, he wanted to leave @2:00. he ended up stayin till 3 w/me n walked me to my car...hah found it amusing...i guess it was cuz he won today. boys are weird.&#xD;
&#xD;
speaking of boys, went to the graduation party of the ex-love of my life. bein the bitch that i am, i went partly just to look hella cute and try to make him feel like he made a mistake of breaking my heart 5 years ago. i think it worked cuz he wants to kick it and asked if he could call me. i told him, ill call him...but i dont call boys, so that wont be happening. hah, revenge is sweet. but i dont hate him anymore, a slight bit bitter but whatever. he hasnt changed (appearance wise) since high school. same hair, same clothes, blah, blah, blah...only difference is that he grew a small mustache. &#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
i started sparring again after a 4 year absence...kinda rusty but i'll be fine. i had to partner up with this older guy on the bags...seems ok, he's old right...i can hang...right? hell no that OG hits like hes my age! shit...i didnt wanna admit it but he knocked the wind outta me a few times, but i acted like it didnt phase me. but man, was i hurting! he was nice tho and asked if he was hitting too hard, but i didnt wanna look like a wuss and told him "no...i can take it". what a mistake! he was surprised i could hang and told me that hes been boxing for 20 years. mofo! why didnt he tell me earlier. i woke up this morning w/some chest pains! damn him!&#xD;
&#xD;
onto my story, me this one guy started choppin it up during class. as ive learned before, kickboxing isnt the ideal place to meet a guy. (meliss knows whats up). since im the only girl that fights with the guys, i eventually have to fight him. sucks...so we were throwin punches, he wasnt playin cuz he landed some punches on my side, but i found one open shot to his head, he moved, i missed my target, and got him on his dome. so what do u guys think? ya think he would wanna talk to me again? fuck, this is the second time this happened. the first time, i sparred this guy i liked and beat him w/ a round kick to his head, he immediately left the class and i never saw him again! boo...&#xD;

got a B+ in italian-BRAVA!!! cant speak, cant write it, can slightly read it, but since i scored high i get to SKIP a whole semester of italian and go straight to italian 4...thats right 4! im really gonna try tho, my plan is to learn to seduce italian men in italy by the time i live there next summer! &#xD;
&#xD;
got a A- in CPR- but if if u need help i probably cant help u cuz i get everything mixed up, so its better that u dont ask...i crumble under pressure if someone elses life is in my hands...&#xD;
&#xD;
and my fashion class...oh that mofo fashion bs class...gots a B...which is coo for not tryin. so fashion entreprenuership aint my forte, but i know that any other aspect of fashion i can totally kick ass in.&#xD;

First stop Kona, Hawaii for 3 days, from there fly to Chicago for 3 days, from there to Orlando for 5, from there back to CHicago only to drive to Wisconsin for 4th of July weekend, then back home for a day to pack my bags again and head to Vegas w/my homeboys. i know...packed! Mid july i get a shopping spree in palm springs, end of july hopefully to Hawaii w/the homies, and 2nd week of august to Aruba or Maui, and perhaps Rome in mid august. I LOVE TRAVELING. i can only wish summer was longer because i had to cut a few trips out of my plans...boo!&#xD;
&#xD;
As some of you guys know, im moving back home to chicago either fall or spring to finish off school at Loyola University. &amp; next summer i'll be living in Rome (for school). but either way, im havin a bon voyage pizarty...haaaaay! i'll be back at least once or twice a month cuz im gonna miss everyone like crazy.&#xD;
So ive recently decided that the next few years im going to live life for me. i wanna do everything,see everything, experience everything, the works...so im gonna go wherever the wind takes me, traveling...whatnot...IM A FREE SPIRIT...and hopefully in my journey i can find total happiness and complete peace of mind.</string></event><ditemid><int>2494</int></ditemid><eventtime><string>2005-05-27 10:56:00</string></eventtime><props><commentalter><int>1117698196</int></commentalter><revnum><int>2</int></revnum><revtime><int>1117260770</int></revtime></props><logtime><string>2005-05-28 06:08:26</string></logtime><anum><int>190</int></anum><url><string>http://hemoleleis23.livejournal.com/2494.html</string></url><event_timestamp><int>1117191360</int></event_timestamp><reply_count><int>2</int></reply_count></post><post><user>hemoleleis23</user><itemid><int>6</int></itemid><subject><string>Chicago Bulls</string></subject><event><string>SO im watching the bulls vs wizard for game 6 of the playoffs, its win or go home for my bulls. they had it, the whole game but fucked up the last 30 seconds really bad. now theyre fuckin eliminated!

heart dropped...</string></subject><event><string>so i started writing on "urban livez" for underground hip hop spoken word, i decided to go explore the site, n i ended up for my ex's site. i wish i hadnt gone through his pieces but i did...curiousity killed the cat. 2 of his pieces were about me n my physical self, and about 6 or 7 of the other pieces were about his "true love"-his best friend (whom he claimed he had no feelings for)and how much he loved her n would dropped everything for her. &amp; he posted this while we were together. i know, hes scum. i know that its in the past but never-the-less, it hurt...damn did it hurt...it got me deep. id be lying if i told u guys that i absolutely didnt give a flying fuck about him, but a tiny tiny piece of me still cares...or cared. after this shit he is offically dead, n im only going to write about him slanderously for revenge cuz i now i despise him for this shit. he posted it for the world to see and made me into a damn fool. i fuckin hate him, ASSHOLE! sorry im a little bitter. i already regreted a lot of things w/him, i wasted 1 year of my life with this clown...our whole relationship was a mo fo lie...boys suck.&#xD;
&#xD;
heres the piece that killed me...&#xD;
&#xD;
In that spilt second our eyes meet &#xD;
it turns a baby into me &#xD;
Time stops and my head is filled &#xD;
of thoughts of what could be &#xD;
Of what should be, if i wasnt such a pussy &#xD;
her eyes tame me &#xD;
somehow that normally cocky conceited man, &#xD;
turns back into that 15year old pimple faced boy &#xD;
who would look down, when girls were around. &#xD;
God Damn! Why does she have this power over me. &#xD;
Ya see i thought i knew what love was before &#xD;
but man was i wrong. &#xD;
Because true love isnt telling your girlfriend i love you, &#xD;
when you know your saying it only for stability and wanting to be secure. &#xD;
Its looking into someones eyes knowing you want more, &#xD;
More then juss a friendship, more then just a smokin buddy, &#xD;
more then just the girl you walk to her car at 3 in the morning &#xD;
just to make sure she gets home safe, &#xD;
Its doing all that not wanting or expecting any reward. &#xD;
Its doing all that, while getting nothing back, and you dont care. &#xD;
I feel so lucky just to be around her, &#xD;
just to be the one to get her orange juice when shes sick, &#xD;
just to be the one she calls when no one else will listen. &#xD;
True love is SILENT. The funny thing is, she will never know how i feel. &#xD;
Because i dont want to lose her. &#xD;
Ive seen many friends come and go for that reason, &#xD;
and i promised myself i wouldnt be one of them. &#xD;
Some say i have nothing to loose, but to loose her friendship &#xD;
is to loose that one shred of hope, &#xD;
that one thing that ties us together, &#xD;
maybe one day shell realize how i feel &#xD;
and shell feel the same &#xD;
dreaming for that one day when everything comes together, &#xD;
is worth the wait.&#xD;
&#xD;
so this line is what got me..."Because true love isnt telling your girlfriend i love you, when you know your saying it only for stability and wanting to be secure."&#xD;
im officially crushed...n so hurt, what worst is that it was posted right after my bday (in Sept) &amp; FYI we broke up after xmas.&#xD;
&#xD;
why cant i find a good guy? just one...n a real man that knows how to treat a lady...n wont put up a front just to get with you n drop it after we get together.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
for u guys that know how he looks like and happens to see him around, MEAN MUG HIS ASS!!!!!thanks</string></event><ditemid><int>932</int></ditemid><eventtime><string>2005-04-26 01:19:00</string></eventtime><props><current_moodid><int>129</int></current_moodid><revnum><int>1</int></revnum><revtime><int>1114504960</int></revtime></props><logtime><string>2005-04-26 08:41:15</string></logtime><anum><int>164</int></anum><url><string>http://hemoleleis23.livejournal.com/932.html</string></url><event_timestamp><int>1114478340</int></event_timestamp><reply_count><int>0</int></reply_count></post><post><user>hemoleleis23</user><itemid><int>1</int></itemid><subject><string>Im so computer illiterate!</string></subject><event><string>im taking some steps to help out my illiterate condition. this is one of them n this journal is just a test.</string></event><ditemid><int>447</int></ditemid><eventtime><string>2005-03-09 00:09:00</string></eventtime><props><commentalter><int>1110358602</int></commentalter></props><logtime><string>2005-03-09 08:11:12</string></logtime><anum><int>191</int></anum><url><string>http://hemoleleis23.livejournal.com/447.html</string></url><event_timestamp><int>1110326940</int></event_timestamp><reply_count><int>1</int></reply_count></post>
